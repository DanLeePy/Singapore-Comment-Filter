Meaning I can cancel before the 2yr charges???
"Honestly, I fking hate it when my ex says she wants to stay as friends after breakup. Like what the point of staying as friends when she herself doesn’t even want reply my sms and giving excuses like busy when she got time to post instastory of her going out with friends. Only call me when she talk about how much I have change since the break, like wtfps for the rant but needed to vent it out since I am in camp and can’t really do it inside :( :P"
:-(( hugs to you. consider going no contact with her so that your feelings will subside! it's not fair on your part that you're always initiating and she constantly flakes on you.
"I agree with u. Fk em, blocked."
"hey man, im sure that it is possible to be friends after breaking up, BUT, do give it time, especially for yourself, try not to force it.heart is with you man."
"Hey Tks for the nice advice, honestly I don’t think she worth being friends with. Out of the times I have text and call within like 6 months period, she only call back like twice. And when she call, she keeps giving me an indecisive answer about many things which I feel like she being a cunt about it"
Cant seem to search changi to busan flight on silkair website. But why some people managed to and already know the price.Anyone here can advise?
"I thought Carousell feedback is supposed to be simultaneous? I gave positive feedback and it appears on their profile but I didn't get any feedback. This has occured to me five times already.I don't think it's the system, feels more like people aren't bothering to write a feedback even after they got postive feedback. It's quite annoying."
Did you tell them you wanted feedback too?

"Don’t have anyone to talk to, but in need of someone to talk to. Some sort of counselling or a pair of listening ear..?"
"Your last post was 6 months ago. Try to talk here more often. Don't let people judge you because they down vote you and all that nonsense. ""100 people may not believe in you but all it takes is that 1 person who believe in you"". You may have anxiety or are on the introverted side but I honestly hope you find someone who can listen to you."
"Question for the audiophiles: I listen to and play a lot of music, but I'm not an audiophile. My music is encoded mostly in 320kbps at max. If I'm on my computer, there's likely going to be music playing unless I'm watching videos, playing games or studying intently.Should I bother getting a good headphone at the expense of an attached mic, or is settling for a bang for buck headset with mic good enough?I'm looking at the Corsair HS50 which seems to be really good value for money based on my research. It's only $79 which is really affordable.Just a quick question which I intend to research by myself too when I have the time, but gotta take a break since I have an early day tomorrow haha"
"once you go down the audiophile route, it's hard to turn back. what's your budget like? if you have the time, scroll through head-fi.org"
Do you listen to music conscientiously? Or it's just background stuff and you want the mic for gaming/chatting and the convenience of not having a separate mic. also genres?
"I do listen to it conscientiously more than just having it in the background. I do think the mic would be nice for gaming and voice chatting. I don't game that much anymore and honestly have a webcam that has a mediocre mic, but it'd be nice to have the option of very clear sound through the air.The genres that I think might justify a better pair of headphones would be the progressive stuff I listen to. I'd say they make up at least 10 to 30% of my music, but I'm not sure how much compression goes into them (see what I mean about not being an audiophile? :p)"
"Have u tried any of the expensive dacs, headphones, etc? I'll get lynched for saying this near audophiles, but i couldnt tell the difference between lets say hd600 and hd800 on a good dac and amp."

"Working adults of r/Singapore, how do you ace job interviews? Any tips?It is very weird to be asking this - especially since I have been in the workforce for a year. But I suspected (and rather strongly), that I got my current position not because I impressed them with my interview skills but more of the fact that my department was badly under-staffed due to high turn-over.I went for 2 interviews thereafter - one for MTI and another one at some other ministry that is quite well-known for grilling interviewees. And despite how much I prepared (trade figures, latest developments, etc), my mind just went blank when they asked me - ""so tell me more about yourself."" I hmmed and hawed all the way - and when they threw curveball questions I really just kinda froze.People have told me that confidence is key, and that cannot be taught. Interviewers are not looking for perfect answers but more on how well you handle uncomfortable situations. But how can I overcome this? :/Having an interview for another CS position which means ALOT to me. Hoping not to fuck it up. Haha."
"> ""so tell me more about yourself.""Just talk about your hobbies and how you usually spend your weekends like you would to a new friend. The purpose of this question is usually for the interviewers to find out if you are someone they can be comfortable around with socially, because they will be around you eight hours five days a week. The interviewer is trying to get a feel of you as person. As long as you don't behave like a psychopath (""I lick knives.""), you will generally do alright.Here's a mental trick for easing your nervousness.Once I was really nervous about going to an interview. I was afraid of messing it up. My friend, seeing how anxious I was, told me, ""Hey, it's okay to screw up. It's okay if you don't get this job.""I was like, ""Eh, really?""I was still nervous, but knowing that it was okie to screw up took the pressure off. The stakes were not so high. I was a bit more relaxed and friendly during the interview. So in the end, I didn't screw up the interview, but I didn't get that job either.But for the next interview, I went for it with the same mindset. Hey, it's okie if I don't get this job. It's okie to make mistakes. It's okie to screw up. The interview became just a friendly chat to me, for both the interviewers and me to find out more about each other. I was really cheerful and chirpy for that interview. It's a bit like meeting new friends at a hackathon and having common tech topics to chat about. You can feel the enthusiasm pouring out of my pores. At one point when I was going on with some gusto about a topic, I was even thinking, man, even I want to hire myself after this interview!Anyway, I left the interview with some positive vibes. I was going, ah well, maybe I wouldn't get the job this time as well, but it was a good chat. I was ready to go back home to rest.Half an hour later, I got a phone call from the interviewer.I got the job. (Yeeeeaaaaaaaaaah~)"
"I went for this career counseling session recently at Lifelong Learning Institute, and a career coach actually told me that ""tell me about yourself"" isn't something for you to tell about your hobbies and what you like to do during weekends. One should be saying more about why you want the job and focus on sharing about the experience related to the job you are applying for. Do not focus on sharing about your academic background or your family or your hobbies.So, during interviews, is it advisable to avoid talking about hobbies unless being asked?"
"You mentioned that your mind went blank when they asked you ""tell me more about yourself"". In my opinion, I find that you're actually trying to search within yourself what would be a perfect model for them and trying to answer. This mental building process is not natural, that's why you keep hesitating when answering.I would say organize your thoughts and key points before the interview so the answers will come out almost like reflex when asked questions about yourself, your work, etc. Don't be afraid of taking some time or even ask for a couple seconds to internalize their question and answer (of course not like half a minute of silence)"
"Learn pyramid principle, learn to structure your thoughts, finally learn to read the interviewer"
"Hey, go to r/AskReddit and search for interview tips. Not all may be suitable for local contexts but I found some pretty good advice there. All the best for your interview!"
"not because I impressed them with my interview skills but more of the fact that my department was badly under-staffed due to high turn-over.I get the feeling with my diploma scholarship too. It's not because I smashed the interview (I got smashed instead), but because they were really desperate."
"Bunk mates cleared the bunk while I was away on course, didn't bother to find out who's stuff they were throwing away. My poor green mug, lunchbox, flask and biscuit tin are gone forever..."

Nice! Care to share?
Small amounts in both stashaway and Posb invest :)SA for US based ETFs (abit more volatile) Posb for STI (Singapore based stocks)Still considering SSB - hopefully interest rates will increase :)
What’s SA?
Stashaway :)
Oh my bad. I thought it was a new department of DBS or Citibank to trade foreign assets
Nice! I'm considering Autowealth or Stashaway.
"I took very long to consider too.. think AW has a minimum amount to start and I wanted to try and learn how Robo works, so SA makes for sense for now :)"
I see. I'm probably leaning towards Autowealth for the cheaper fees.
"If it’s a small amount, won’t differ too much I guess"

Shag just broke up with my gf after about half a year. Had some serious issues neither of us could really resolve but still not fun to end it. Hope the future will be alright
"Hey bro,The first few weeks is going to be tough. Everything damn thing you do will remind you of her. The inside jokes, the “hows my day”, the quiet moments.There’s nothing I can say, except “it gets better”.Time heals. Time always heals.When you’re feeling sad and down, turn to a friend, your family or treat yourself. It sucks now, but you’ll be alright. Everything is going to be alright, I promise you.If you feel lonely, just chat here. Reddit’s a big family. Otherwise use your precious time to reconnect with people. Your grandparents would certainly love time with you. Or meet your parents for a meal. Take your friends out.A wise man on reddit once said, loss is like waves in the ocean. The first waves are high and mighty. It keeps coming back; again and again. It hits you. All the time.Then as time goes, the waves start to hit with longer intervals between them. The waves are shallow-er. The waves never go away, but it will hurt you less.I wish all the peace for you. Have a great day, buddy."
yikes. big hugs to you. it's tough but learn from the mistakes in that relationship to improve yourself and know what you want in the next one :-)
"Don’t worry bro, many of us faced similar periods in our lives.. if it’s for the better good for any party, then it’s a good decision.Worse is when you break up, either party goes crazy and starts doing things to harm themselves 😢"
"You're going to be fine. You're going to miss her and you will smile at the sweet and happy memories. But every moment that u miss her and want her back. Think about why this relationship didn't work out. Sometimes, you just can't mend things, or ya'll just incompatible. Sometimes in life, have to learn to move forward."
"Sounds like the same shit I experience with dropping a game I've been with for a long time lol. Keep looking back at past videos/screenshot and reminisce, start up the game and then remember why I dropped it in the first place."
wad were the issues
Normally they will look at the centre mirror to check everyone alight. So just wave in that direction when they are looking
"I wonder, in the case of choosing names for their child, if parents really think hard enough on how they would be made fun of for being named something ridiculous like ""Baby"" or ""Abcde"". It's surprising how some doesn't see any problems with that.And yes I know my flair is one thing, but Chinese is excusable somewhat. Unless your kid's name's initials lead to L J or C B and they have to serve NS."
They want to be unique
is it normal for a guy whom youre not very close to to suddenly message you and ask you how youre doing?
MLM
"Totally not close previously? Only two reasons then (in my opinion). One to sell you products, one is to know more about you (as dating targets)."
"group member for one of my assignments, hes not in sales"
Wanna jio you out
but why only after several months?
"Maybe he feels if he asked you out right after the semester it's a bit despo. If it's still the start of the semester, then maybe he was just waiting for the semester to end."
hes also not really asking me things to get to know each other better or asking me out though
"Really we're just guessing cause it's fun. He could either be biding his time to lead to the question, or he just wants to chat."
"because if he straight out hit you with that ""hey wanna go out next friday to ilight because iLight you a lot"" you'd think he 100% creep and then bluetick/ignore.I think we guys tend to play the long game and wait to gauge if you're in the least bit interested (or at least me)"
Finally got the courage
it is only normal for him because he's interested in you.probably took him a lot of courage to do it
Tried to catch up with a guy but he didn't reply my message. Forget about it.Yes took me a lot of courage to send it out haha and I was so anxious that I didn't dare to look at my phone haha. Oh well.
"Wahlao eh op pls dun listen to the replies down below these ppl damn cek ark.Btw hey friend, it’s been a long time since we catch up. My life is fantastic now cus my bro intro this biz to me. I feel that good things must share with u mah. U wan come out drink kopi with me, I can share my inspirational stories. Don’t worry lah, I’m not going to sell u anything de. I sumpah"
"Hey chiobu, want limkopi mai-ISD"
Inb4 insurance
There was a period of time I messaged people who i used to talk to just to catch up.Am not in insurance.
I wanted to but the other party doesnt want to reply my message.
Ouch. But not everyone is like that one ba :)
Yeap not everyone is like that. I dont have a lot of people in mind that I want to meet thou. The maximum number of times I met with a same person is like 3-4 times LOL.. We went to the same place and had the same food.
I've been wanting to do that! Just go down my friend list and rekindle the friendship a little.
MLM or insurance?
"he hasnt brought up any of those things up though, just asking me how im doing at work and which days I have class on"
"Sounds like gtoundwork for a face to face. ""Hey, wanna meet up on X day? You got no classes on that day right"""

"Been tryina get internships at digital agencies the past few weeks to no avail. Really keen on learning digital marketing/social media strat.My teacher recommended me to his friend, who said ""we'll see what we can do"" at his agency.Man, I'm having faith for an answer."
"Hmmm yeah job market is tough. Have you considered looking around non agency places though, imo experience is experience. Places with great digital marketing strategies are one alternative. For example, I think circles.life does pretty good digital marketing, and I'm pretty sure they're done in-house. Think about brands that you've been excited about in the past year and look at their job boards.Also, how much have you been upselling independent studying outside of school? Like learning SEO strategies, data analytics, copy writing, A/B testing... Not sure how much of it you've done, but companies always love people who take great initiative!Good luck!"
"Thanks for the insight! I'll look into different brands now for sure 😄I play around with advertisements on social media (ie. Instagram) to have some experience for a side project. Helping my ex-lecturer with her digital strategy, and read/watched courses on Udemy and Hubspot. These have helped a lot"
"I’m a digital headhunter, PM.. let me see if I can help :)"
"No prob!That's great! Play up those things on your CV and at the interview stage, and you should be fine.I also had a friend who wrote a funny/clever post on instagram, tagging the company that she liked and getting enough attention that they reached out to her and she eventually got a contract position there."
Does anyone here know a good brand of Wifi Extenders? I need it because the signal connection from my home wifi to my PS4 really sucks and causes a lot of lag within the gameplay. I just want to have a good multiplayer match without having to deal with multiple lags in one day :-(
"Im using tp link. Do take note that different wifi extenders can only reach up to certain speeds, which might cause a bottleneck. For example i have 1gbps speed, but my wifi extender can only reach up to 300mpbs. Why not use a powerline adapter instead?"
I would suggest saving up to get mesh. I've used power line adaptors and mesh. Mesh is more stable
"For those not working and mentally ill, how do you support and sustain your daily expenditure?"
"Not speaking for myself but friend's mother suffered and is still trying to manage with mental health illness (serious case). Last I heard, she works as server in food establishments. There are some places she used to work at, which are quite open to hiring mentally ill individuals. She quits and rests sometimes as sometimes she couldn't handle it. To be fair too, she has good supports from her direct family (husband and children)."
"Anyone can talk about their experience with polytechnic fresh grad salary? If possible, mention the industry too :D"
"1.6 ~ 2.4 in my circle. Pharmacy, research."
Maybe you should be straightforward and ask her for a straightforward answer if she’s not interested?
True. Thanks :).

Interview with big 4 tmr .really worried any tips ?
Warrior magician bowman thief.
"Seiryu, Suzaku, Byakko, Genbu?"
"Exodia, Silfer, Obelisk, King Dragon of Ra?"
Yall need to stop it sia
You need to believe in the heart of the cards.
"KFC, Mcd, Burger King, LJS?"
You really shouldn't tip the interviewer
"Come on, just the tip is ok"
"Anthrax, Megadeth, Slayer and Metallica?"
"Nah I'm just playing with you. In the metal community, the Big 4 usually refers to those four thrash metal bands. :DAnyway good luck for your interview! You can do this!"
Isn't big 4 really in need of manpower all the time that you don't have to worry unless you screw up the interview big time?
Anyone fly Air China internationally before? Good/bad experience?
its fine
I hope you are not confused with China Airlines. China Airlines is a taiwanese airline while Air China is you know from china.
"Yes I was confused, my bad!"
That’s China Airlines. Air China is literally from China.
"for the new s10, is it better to get SIM only plan and buy the s10 separately or sign contract with telco?"
Why not just calculate yourself? All the information you need is available
SIM Only plan. It is definitely cheaper if you do your own calculations.
"Looking at the war going on now, I would do the former."
For the TPG 1st year free trial anyone know whats the early termination charge if applicable at all ??
No termination charge because it's a no contract plan.
Nope.
"what advice do u have for someone who plans to go overseas (Melb :D) for uni in 2020i know fuck all about living on my own, i've never been overseas by myself before. got any lifehacks?"
"Buy a midsized frying pan, a saucepan, and hope you have a microwave/oven and freezer. Then figure out where the nearest market is and where to get cheap meat. Buy stuff in bulk, its cheaper, as long as you have storage space.No hacks here. Cooking isn't particularly hard if you give no shits about plating and presentation. Learn a simple recipe (baked honey chicken was my go-to when I was abroad). Dedicate a weekend to prep a week's worth a meals, then reheat through the week when necessary. Amazing when you're tired from school and don't want to cook. Eggs are also stupidly simple to make for a quick breakfast (scramble in a saucepan, add some butter-fried shrooms, boom, breakfast).Stay on top of your laundry. Designate a laundry day and have a slight buffer in case shit don't dry in time. Living alone for the first time seems daunting, but honestly ain't too hard.One major, major tip is that places overseas never open as late as in Singapore. We're really spoilt by shops and supermarkets that open until 10pm. Overseas, it's not unusual for shops to start shutting by 5. Memorise opening times and for the love of god, memorise public holidays so you don't accidentally run out of food on a day where all the shops are closed for the holidays."
Start researching?
"Start mastering tomato stew. Basically, boil up the canned tomato and add a bit of salt and your favorite vegetables and meat. Voila. A hearty meal.Next, buy an air fryer and learn to cook with it. It’s very easy.If you love meat, then Korean samgyeopsal would be a cheap and convenient alternative too. Just pan fry and voila."
"That seems like a good easy recipe, I'll keep it in mind.I've heard many things about the wonders of air fryer. My mom is considering buying me one just to bring overseas lmao is it that good"
"It’s great. My favorite recipe.Beef cubes, paprika, olive oil, air fry for 6-7 minutes. Delicious. Clean up is minimal."
""
"Are you rich or poor? lolIf you're gonna live on a tight budget, learn how to cook. Eating out is expensive, not to mention unhealthy. Especially if you eat out but go for the cheap options, usually it's damn bad for you. If you ownself cook you can buy ingredients in bulk and cook when you have time. I don't know about specific lifehacks, but maybe start figuring out what your mum does to keep the house clean and learn to do it yourself. Things like operating a washing machine, seems simple but I've seen people fk it up hilariously."
"im middle class but i like to consider myself poor so that i can save more moneymy mom regularly makes my siblings and i do house chores, so i guess chores-wise im good. i just wanna know like tips for getting around the city, staying safe, the habits of the locals, public transport etiquette, things like that"
"I see. Sorry don't have experience in Melbourne as a student, just as a tourist lol. If you're studying in RMIT the transport shouldn't be a problem, plenty of trams and buses in the city centre. There's a pretty significant Chinatown as well if you miss home."
Does anyone know where I might be able to get a copy of ICD-10 locally?
"You need a hard copy? Because as far as I know, ICD-10 is international and available online."
"I'm sure that industrial softwares exist, but I have not yet found a source for public access. A hard copy seems to be my only bet to get the content at the moment (without a related employment or training)."
https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/enWhat do you need that's not available here?
OMG I didn't find this while googling a while ago. Thanks a bunch!
Hahaha okay no prob =) I work in healthcare so I'm familiar... kept wondering what you were trying to get from there lol

"Seeing someone by ala carte coke at mcd, when supermarket is like 2mins walk away. Humans are bizarre."
Some people buy a cup of coke so that they can sit at mcdonalds for 6 hours with their laptop.
Perhaps the same reason why people spend $6 on StarBucks coffee when a nearby kopitiam has even more potent stuff for like almost 6 times cheaper.
Mcd coke is different. Their dispenser are exclusive. (worked at mcd)
Yeah it's sweeter for some reason
Mcd buys syrups straight from CC and does the blend themselves.
Idk why but I like fountain coke better than bottled coke. May be that's why.?
Today I learn my crush memorize my phone number😍
Let us know how it goes!
"Easy lah, we also can. Lai phone number! Wait....10kkBirdNot zharbor.....okay nehmind no need liao"
He never save your number but you keep spamming him
Maybe your crush does that to everyone's number?
Means you are his/her crush
"My manager has been telling me that I need to 'wayang' to move up the corporate ladder (for my benefit) and how I need to learn to make a small task seem like some big task in front of bosses, etc. Of course it's not always true and bosses do look at attitude / actual competency than ability to speak, and there's also peer to peer evaluations. But she's not totally wrong right? I hate this culture and It's making me feel jaded at work."
Wayang has a bad rep but think of it as marketing yourself and leaving an impression of your personal brand on people
Fucking jaded siaPlus need to mingle with colleagues. You don't even know whose your friend or foe.
"Sad but true. She's not wrong. When it's time to push people for promotion, the one that is high profile gets the push"
"She's not wrong. That's corporate life.Instead of making small tasks seem big, what you can do is do them so well that they're impressed. Is it going to help much? Nah. But do it consistently enough and you build yourself a reputation of being the person that they can count on. When it comes to promotion time, you'll also be in a better stead.Another thing you can do is focus on the big, high impact tasks. It's not always doable since you don't always dictate what types of task you get, but if you see an opening, you can go for it.You don't have to wayang to move up, but you need to know that some people actively wayang to move up. If you don't want to do that, then you can passively wayang just by being a good worker."
"I do my best to be a good worker. Her point is that just being that is not enough, and being able to wayang is a must. If not I will always lose out to people who do less work than me but can present themselves better. It's so annoying that life works that way and most bosses don't have the time to evaluate people based on merit alone, especially higher up the management."
"The reason why this works to employees' benefit is because not many bosses will have the time/take time to scrutinize each and every thing you report to them about. But at best it's just a delaying tactic that'll last however long you need to finish the job, if your final output is shit it could backfire and you will get fucked for wasting time."
"Packaging is also important, sadly. Why say you work as McDonald's delivery man when you can say you were part of the last mile delivery of the supply chain of a fortune 500 company?"
"She's not wrong but you're not wrong in hating this bullshit either. I swear for so many of these office jobs out there 90% of it is doing stuff that just bounces around within the company creating more work for each other, and only a small percentage actually goes to producing the actual product. I fking hate it as well. Had to get out of a pretty good govt job just to give my brain a break from this shit."
Reply me please :( i am need job :(
yo where is a good barber (im M) at far east plaza? nothing to ex maybe below 30
I just got bitten by a shit ton of mosquitos at home and hopefully they are not dengue mosquito. Can anybody tell me how to identify them?They have white stripes on their leg which means it's either aedes aegypti or aedes albopictus but I can't tell the difference
"Sorry, can’t help much but try asking that mosquito? I think if you ask politely, it will gladly answer you."
Ok later I go talk to Mr Mosquito after they wake up
Which area do you stay at? Recently they have been releasing some special type of mozzies at some estates.
I stay at the east. The mosquito that are released are just special mosquitos that carries some sort of genes that make the female eggs infertile. Hopefully they can spread faster and just eradicate mosquitos in general

Reiki Circle at ExhaleWow we actually have an event for pseudoscience.
"There are a lot of small scale events for these pseudoscience shit. A friend recently told me about something called ""pranic healing"" which has some truly wild stuff."
"Does it involve ""mana transfer""? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
"I'm not sure about mana transfer, but itbdef involves some ""touch therapy"" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
"I heard about that too. There is a self-help book that's been going around that teaches you to use your five senses to heal yourself. Cant' remember all, but there's touching: Apparently touching with heated hands on some pressure points will heal the sore muscles or some shit, then there's listening to nature: like oceans and whatnot, and it helps with high blood pressure,, then there's sight: if you're feeling stressed or anxious, look up in the sky at night, and apparently the ""star shine"" will heal your anxiety and melt your worries away."
sounds pretty harmless and the placebo effect can be pretty helpful so honestly I don't think it's a bad thing
"it's harmful as you're paying money to buy these books. The authors are earning a lot of money spreading these bullshit. People start believing and spending their money on these ""treatments"" instead of spending that money on real doctors who can actually help them. If the placebo effect is that reliable, there wouldn't be real medications, we'd all be just taking sugar pills instead."

Can use importxml function in Google sheet. But you will have to manually copy each month's thread url cause its not uniform.

Is it gul circle? To connect to future Jurong reginal line?
Yup near the Tuas
It's actually at Tuas Link. The other track just goes into the train Depot.
you found an unloaded chunk
Boon Lay also looked like that until they started extending the EW line...
a great place to do that train scene from spiderman 2

what about the car tho
It's a British car from a James Bond film.
"It's a Lotus Esprit series 3, from the 80s"
"As some have mentioned, it's at the Shunfu area...from what I heard, both of them were brought over from the UK back in the 1980s. The Lotus was supposed to be registered but for some reason it couldn't, so it has been rotting there for >35 years.The house is not abandoned however: there was a light inside and someone was in the house at that time"
You sure is someone and not something?
That 'thing' has good taste if its the case
That sucks. It is a beautiful car and shouldn't deserve this fate.
Haha someone's been walking around shunfu

"what street is this on? It seems like it’s near my area so I may just pop by to have a look, coz kaypoh."
maybe that's one enchanted telephone booth to enter the Ministry of Magic
That Lotus deserves a better fate.
Looks like time traveller enthusiast. A tardis and a delorean lookalike
"Nah, not a delorean. Probably a lotus esprit"
The tardis is stuck in the form of a Police box leh
And it's blue too
Reminds me of the piss filled telephone boxes around London
Its james bond
Is the Lotus road legal? I cant see any plate on it but assuming the owner bought COE for it...?
"It seems to be in terrible shape, probably just a decor for now"
"It doesn’t look like it can pass annual inspection or even run anymore judging from exterior condition. Could be just the chassis body without internals, so technically a chunk of rusty metal in the shape of a car. No idea how you can do that but if you’ve got enough money anything is possible"
Hopefully the tenant is in better shape than the beloved items sitting outdoor!
I feel bad for the lotus :(
"My old house had three of those in our front yard, the previous owner had a thing for British memorabilia"
The house itself looked very retro british style.
did i just hear a random 'fuq ur mudda la' in the background towards the end of the video??
Still got echo.
Cyclist must be riding to his boxing class. That was a nice straight jab.
"Southpaw cyclist. Although judging from his footwork, i don't think he took boxing before."
"Took boxing for a bit, but that seemed to resemble a bit more of a hook. Could be a jab that’s too near thought."
"Does anyone else hear ""fuck your mother la!"" In the background?At a out 16seconds"
Heard it too. Some auntie HAHA
His look of shock when he got blasted in the face is priceless hahaha. I think people need to get punched in the mouth once in awhile so we'll all know that shit hurts and learn to avoid physical conflict.
Everyone has a plan until they are punched in the face.
Or maybe just avoid physical conflict without needing the threat of getting hurt
Yea but some lessons stick with you forever when you learn them the hard way hahaha
WASTED
Lol wake up at SGH with half cash and no grenades
My initial reaction is to side with the cyclist. He defended himself well but I wanna know what made it escalate to that point.
"Driver looked like he was holding on to something in his hand, the way he charged out of the lorry was also signaling aggression."
Yeah I completely agree with you there. It’s obvious the driver had a lot of chances to back down but instead decided to escalate it.
Driver seemed to be holding a dark glass bottle. Looks like a bottle of 紅舌狗 tbh.
In true 369 fashion
"Ya, but he seems to be threatening."
Wah wah wah wah wah. WAAH! Wah!
I really hope to see less of these incidents. I think I’m not the only one. Be safe everyone
Nice hook.He did the right thing in trying to walk away too. The lorry driver needed to just chill the hell out.
Hit hard enough in the chin and you'll knock a man out. Aiming for the chin is always a good idea.
Walking away is always the best idea.
"Yes, always descalate first but worst comes to worst, keep your hands up aim for the chin. Unless the dude has a weapon, just run even if you have a weapon too."
"Good way to hurt your hand, that is bad advice. Plenty of other soft spots to aim at that can cause much more pain and damage on a person without hurting yourself in return. A hit on the chin isn't a guaranteed knockout anyway."
One punch man
Driver thought he could scare the cyclist and froze when he realised the cyclist was up for it and also much bigger than him.Never threaten someone if you aren’t prepared to follow through.
Got it from Facebook
10/10 fb translate
TKO
He went down quick holy shit
A little too quick
One Punch Man
When will people learn that it's no point fighting in Singapore even if you're in the right? In the end both will get charged and jailed/fined.
Cyclist can easily claim self-defense. Driver is clearly holding a glass bottle of some kind
"Didn't even need to be armed. Video clearly shows aggressive charging. The cyclist hit him once and then walked away, which would seem to qualify as minimum force."
r/instantkarma
Ko liao
Solid hit to be fair
Did that lorry driver try to chase afterwords?
"After scrolling through the comments on FB, it's so surprising seeing the internet siding with the cyclist on this one.But nice moves by this guy though mad respect"
Theres nothing surprising; the cyclist did very very little wrong.The previous case the cyclist was clearly an asshole.
"You can see the driver holding a bottle as a weapon, so hopefully he can claim that it was self defence."
"What is the lorry driver holding?Wuss made first move and charged at someone while holding a weapon, and gets knocked out. Good. Get rekt."
Valentine flowers
Poor lorry driver got rejected
That punch was solid
Lmao the way he fell after getting punched
"Facebook links are not allowed on this subreddit.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns."
/r/instantregret
"Want to act hero, become zero..."
Hmm.. so whats the law regarding punching someone in the face?
"Depends on what SPF investigation reveal. Most likely affray involving both cyclist and driver.Aside from the punch, there is probably going to be another charge against the driver under the Road Traffic Act and Penal Code.Moral of the story: don't fight. Run if you can, and call for help. Only fight if it's the last resort and your life depends on it -- e.g. trapped in a lift/room with an attacker with no way out."
"Depends on the case. Generally punching someone is classified as Voluntarily causing hurt.(Section 319 of the penal code)In the context of self defence, section 96-106 of the penal code is the right to private defence. Situations where reasonable force may be used are outlined here, which may extend to the use of deadly force in certain situations."
Maybe this answers your question
what did you expect after confronting someone like that lol
“It is all overr!!”
One punch one kill!!!!
"1 punch, and he's out"
Me: Why is the driver leaving the safety of his lorry?*POW*oh well.
"Everyone chill. One love, c'mon.Enough pain in the world, let's not hurt one another."
We officially have a chronic problem of this bullsh
"Like what the old saying goes, Don't start something if you can't see it through.Shouldn't even start a fight if he can't get through with it.Imo he's lucky that the cyclist only punched once."
Woooahhh. WOOOAHH. WOOOOOOOOAAAHH. Woahh..
Oof
Cyclist 1-0 Lorry Driver
Jesus Christ he just folded
The guy got his just deserts.
Never thought i see the day everyone side with an ang mo cyclist.Instant karma but he is gonna get into trouble for that.

It's a lifesaver when you dont have your cellphone
"Yeah, pager & coin phone forever friends."
"Well, provided you remember the numbers."
"Well, back then we didn't have a choice, so numbers were ingrained in our heads.These days we're dependant on our phones.I can't RMB my current partners mobile number, but I can recite my primary schools crush's with no problem to this day.It's been 24 years."
Does anyone rmb the penguin card which has $5 phone credit for such public phones? Not sure if it still exists
"Yup, black at the back with small words, and a magnetic strip."
Born in the early 80s and I have no idea what you're talking about. I only remember phone cards and people collecting those.
How many of you remember the cheat code to make free calls? wink wink
I can't remember what I do not know. Do tell xD
"Omg, i don't remember it but I used the cheat code to make free calls from the phone located in my primary school... to call my mama to tell her i forgot to bring my homework :("
Did mama really bring your homework?
"Depending on what the penalty was... but generally, yes, because mama was a housewife who doted on me. For some reason, back then, the penalty for not bringing homework in primary school seemed more severe than in secondary school(!!)."
"I remember passing by one of the ""bad"" classes in primary school when i was still in P1. The teacher was hitting the students palms with a wooden ruler (they were all lining up to be punished) and shouting ""devils, bloodsuckers!"". Plus she was big sized and look fierce."
"Omg that must have been a long time ago... I don’t think physically hitting students was legal (or you know, a widespread practice) in my time. How old are you now? I remember the times where I thought so little of myself because I was scolded by teachers in primary school... then by secondary school idgaf about what teachers thought about me and would always skip classes😅"
Not OP but I received that punishment along with some other classmates in Primary 3 because we forgot to bring our homework. Those were the days when the blackboard and chalk still exists and Mr Ong Teng Cheong was our president. The blackboard was changed to white board when I was in Pri 5. Am 32 this year haha!
"devils, bloodsuckers!Doesn't even make sense."
Was it just picking up the phone and waiting for the dial tone? Then quickly key the number you want to call?
I don't recall this technique. You mean dialling before the dial tone comes on is it.
"Used to call (home) my mother during recess everyday when I was in Primary 1 and 2; she would answer the phone and talk to me properly for that 1 minute every time. No scolding, no rebuke, just a nice 1 minute call about anything.Looking back at it, kinda silly since half the day was done but it's a nice little memory to hang on to; especially since She's passed away now.Edit: thanks for bringing those nice memories back for me, even if unintended."
"Aww, thats such a wholesome memory. Made me tear up. I wish I had that with my mum. She's... A real piece of work. I can only hope to be the best I can be for my kids and have that kind of memory with them."
i still see them around but most of the time they are not connected. Just left there because the owners cant be bothered to move them. :(....remember those parrot cards that some of us used to make phone calls LMAO
I still have the cards!
There used to be a hack in primary school to call without paying 10 cents. I probably owe the school 3-4 bucks in unpaid phone calls.
Does it really works?I tried but it always cut off once the other party answer the call
"Used to work for me like a charm. But this was like 1998-2000s. #1233*, still remember the key."
Foreigners that can't afford phones... :(
Some old folks and certain foreigners still do.
"Hmm I do see domestic workers using public phones but not the coin one, the card one."
I remember using these when i was in primary school to call my parents after school since i didn’t have a handphone back then. Don’t think anybody uses them anymore now though
"I used to call home when I'm out with my friends after school with these, without putting any coins.2 consecutive calls would mean I'm coming home soon."
Omg yes. There would be a queue in school to use these phones. There was a choice of this or the one with the card that would make a hole at the value left on the card. I was always calling back to say I missed the bus or that I was staying back to play... Or that I forgot something important.
Payphone in 2019
Op is that you
dayum good old memories
"For real, I saw an old grandmother using the payphoje on Sunday! It was the bigger ones with metal casing, not this plastic ones. The ones you find at the airport"
Helpers still use commonly
"I grew up in Singapore, the first pic I was 11 years old. The Sentosa dragon walk was one of my favourite things. We left in 1998, and I returned for the first time in 2012. I was overwhelmed at how much Sentosa had changed, and was saddened to see the dragons had gone. After coming across the old hut that had the snakes on it I started looking through the jungle areas and came across my beloved dragon. Are they still there hiding away?"
I lived here all my life and I’ve never seen that dragon before. I just remember taking monorail at and looking down at the dark jungle below imagining it was Jurassic Park.
"There was a whole “dragon trail” this was the beginning of the walk. There was a water dragon in a fountain, a snake hut with a dragon on top and few others"
"I remember that. I vaguely remember that there used to a roller coaster in Sentosa as well, one of those small wooden ones."
You mean the monorail?
"No no they used to have this ASEAN village or something, used to have a roller coaster in there."
OH. I forgot the Asian Village used to be there. Never knew they had a rollercoaster though.
"They did. I remember going to the Asian Village for a school excursion. My classmates and I rode that thing continuously. Finished the ride, went straight back to the queue because we were given unlimited rides to everything."
Volcano land!
Where is this ? Like which Monorail stop is the closest and how do I walk there? How could I have lived my whole life without knowing? @.@
It’s now the imbiah trail. You may have to look a bit harder to find the dragons
There used to be dinosaur statues around there too if I recall correctly.
"Is that why I made the Jurassic Park connection? I also remember the monorail used to be an like open train carts, not the LRT we have now."
Yeah kinda like those box monorails in Roller Coaster Tycoon that sits up to 4 in a carriage and has like small doors.
"Unfortunately Sentosa has become overly crowded and touristy, it's almost like a reflection of Singapore itself.I used to go to Sentosa every weekend to play volleyball in the late 2000s-mid 2010s. the sandy white beaches were just as advertised, there was a good amount of beachgoers but not too crowded, and it was a nice place to hang out in general.i stopped going for many years and when i went back last year i was so disappointed. Sentosa had become so crowded and everything was so commercialised. The queues to get onto the monorail were longer than the peak hour mrt wait for god's sake. Instead of people enjoying the sand and the sun, you get tourists in big floppy hats taking selfies and loud, obnoxious ""festivals"" with horribly overpriced food.Sentosa used to be my refuge from the crazy city life, but now it's as bad as orchard road on the weekends. Thankfully i've found other places in Singapore that allow me the same peace and quiet.EDIT: on second thought better not reveal my new refuge haha"
Say eh pls
Pulau ubin Edit: spelling
Lazarus island?
Coney Island isit?
Now I feel like going on a dragon hunt.
Do it! Report back!
"Hmm 6 years since then, honestly not sure if they are still around. Things do change fairly quickly. Anyone with a recent visit/photo?"
Upvoted the choice of your ID
10yearchallenge
Two have merged to become one.
I think some of the dragons are still around in the nature trail but they're not the main attraction anymore. I used to get so excited whenever I got off the cable car to Sentosa because of the dragon on top of Imbiah Lookout!
This dragon isn't around anymore I guess? Haven't been back to Sentosa for a loooooooooong time.So Expensive and Nothing TO See Anyway.
Yup it got demolished to make way for the Carlsberg Sky Tower
Walaneh..
Oh! I had forgotten about him! I must try and find some images of the rest of the dragons
Agreed sentosa has lost its charm. It is quickly turning into nothing but an extension of the city...
Is it still around though?sorry it is a bit unclear to me. loved these things when I was a kid.
"The photo was 2012, I haven’t been again to see. Hopefully!"
i love taking the monorail and trying to find the dinosaurs...
"Huh, I spent a little bit of my childhood in Singapore as well, and haven't been to Sentosa in decades but vaguely remember this dragon now that you've posted a picture of it. What I remember more is this narrow bridge on the beach, and I kicked something and lost my sandal over the edge (but my aunt somehow got it back, I think)."
"Wow this is sad, there were two girls and after the dragon came alive and ate one of them."
I hate going there when i was a kid cause i was scared of the dragons ahahha
"I love the giant bones, I wonder if they are still there."
"I walked through the whole trail area, all I found was this guy, the old hut and the fountain dragon that had been hovered in plants"
A pity...
"Oh my, right in the nostalgia. I need to go back soon and see my old childhood memories"
Yes I had some major feels that day.
"That's flat like a beached whale!Or, perhaps, jellyfish :)"
any idea how the time difference between these shots?
"I’m thinking the first one was probably 1996, and the more recent was 2012"
"same person from the first, the first has too but i assume at least one of the people in the first is the person in the second....it would made sense....i'm being noise dot mind me"
Yep! Me and my sister is in the first as well
That's really neat! I hope it's still around.
This dragon head still exists?How to get there?
"It was there in 2012, I don’t see why they would have bothered to knock it down unless it’s been built over. If you google Sentosa dragon trail you may have more luck. I think it is still labelled as a natural trail, but this dragon is at the beginning off the path"
theres a dragon waterfall somewhere inside too
The upskirt dragon!
"I remember this. It also leads to a fountain last time. Really miss the old Sentosa, especially places like the Fantasy Island which is a water theme park. Super fun. All has changed."
I loved fantasy island but apparently it was pretty dangerous at the end!
Any idea what landmark was this flat dragon close to?
"Maybe this info is helpful:The trail technically began at the Dragon Court of Imbiah Lookout. The Dragon Court featured a statue of a dragon’s head and front claws, while its tail was supposed to be somewhere along the trail. The dragon’s head was demolished in 2003, and was replaced with the Tiger sky tower. Most of the other dragon “relics” are still visible today, although the dragon narrative has been dropped. Today, the Nature Walk is promoted purely as such – a walk in nature. The Nature Discovery directs visitors from Imbiah Lookout to the Nature Walk.If you can find any of the dragon relics then you should be able to find the others. This walkway was the “entry” and close to the cable car arrival area"
There were other dragon sculptures as well right? Iirc.
"Yes, my memory is fuzzy but there was an archway if stone with a dragon on it, twin dragons, a dragon fountain, the hut with snakes on the post and dragon on top."
That's what i thought. I remember trying to find all those dragons when i was young. Every kid loves their dragons

Saw this question raised in r/perth and was curious to know your thoughts. For me it’s the aibi gym equipment store that seem to be everywhere in malls but always bo lang inside and the staff like always very eng. Don’t get how they are still operating. Money laundering?
Poh Kim DVD
This. Because who on earth buys DVDs when streaming services are all the rage.Can't imagine them making any profit to be honest.
"actually i know old people who still rent from them... these are the sort of people you won't see in your daily lives because they wake up, go to the park to listen to all the songbirds, go rent dvd and watch, and stay home after 6pm."
middle age aunties who watch korean dramas but want them Mandarin/chinese dubbed? Since online stream is in korean language. Also people who bought bluray dvds.
The older folk whose kids don't want to teach mum/dad how to watch drama online.
Haha.. the shop assistant at the outlet near my place is usually very free. And interestingly enough they are still hiring.. Hmm
More ironic thing should be the shop assistant watching free streams on her phone/tablets.
I was wondering why the shop doesn't just go to the vending machine route. No need shop assistant.
Their client base might not know how to use a vending machine.
Little work and some pay. Someone is happy I guess?
"I still buy 4K BDs, but PKs prices are atrocious. Must be the clueless elderly that pay those prices keeping PK alive."
"Home Fix. They stock so much crap, yet mysteriously never seem to have the one thing you really need in stock"
"And the best part is if they have it, it's confirm overpriced. Worst is the spray paint almost double the price"
Pay for convenience. People who know the trade know where to shop but it's not exactly convenient especially when you are desperate for fixes.
"I wish someone open up a Home Depot or Bunnings. Just one outlet/warehouse at Tampines with IKEA. As a DIY-er, it pains me to have to go through so much hassle to simple get plywood and other simple home improvement stuff."
There's a strong diy spirit in aus. Sg I'm not too sure
"Honestly, if I lived in Aus i'd go the DIY route too. I like DIY and can imagine fixing up stuff, building my own shelves on the weekends just as a hobby. I could partition part of my garage, or a shed in my back garden just for this."
"Because the average Singaporean doesn't have the space at home to do DIY stuff haha plus if I'm not wrong there are regulations regarding doing machining work in hdb homes? Something related to URA planning if I'm not wrong, but in too lazy to research the regulations.If I had a landed property I'd probably build a small DIY space myself, but I'm too low ses haha"
Open a Bunnings and sell sausages in bread out the front every weekend.
"Yes! Look at IKEA. All the old folks come for the free coffee and cheaper-than-toastbox breakfast, then on the way start shopping."
"Simple stuff we take for granted is infuriatingly hard to find for some reason. Not just DYi things, even a simple inflatable ball took me days to find. I lived in the Rochor area."
"Probably because most stores try to generalise instead of specialising. But in Singapore’s rental climate, probably that’s the only way for them to survive."
Hands On 😭
They just closed down at Causeway Point. Guess business has gone down
Mr Fix > Home Fix
Handphone accessory shop. Not the small ones but the larger ones. Their inventory must be so bloated.
but the margin is super high
"On that note, how do those mini handphone stalls (those that prop themselves infront of a shop) make any business?"
Those speaker stores at Adelphi haha
High end speakers are very expensive. Margins good I believe
KEF!
True. But their margins are insane along with the prices. I am sure they can survive by selling 10 pairs of high end speakers in a month.
Actually it's every store in Adelphi except the eateries. Been there last week and was asking my friend the same question
"I know, compared to steals people get in the US, as can be seen at /r/BudgetAudiophile the stuff at Adelphi is grossly overpriced. They probably only need one good customer a day to make decent money. Just the 'audiophile' power adapters can cost thousands of dollars! I knew of one person who in the early 2000s had spent upward of 100k on audiophile equipment, and this wasn't a rich guy, just a regular hard earning bloke who put away all his savings and some more in the pursuit of purist audio, smh. I always enjoyed browsing Adelphi and getting some auditions done for equipment that I knew I will never buy, heh."
"I respected Jaben. They used to bring in budget stuff, and catered to even budget enthusiasts.Now they're just turning a profit."
"Ah yes. Good deals are to be had there... I think they really need the revenue since not many are interested in hifi these days.I got nearly a 40% “discount” on mine... and the price was offered to me! It’s a slightly older floor model, but a good deal is a good deal, and I was glad I could help them clear the stock. I’m damn happy with it. Haha"
"There is a small community of audiophiles and audio enthusiasts who enjoy modding their sound system. It's quite an expensive hobby tbh.On a side note, anyone knows what happened the the uncle selling fruit juice on level 1? I always go to his shop when i'm in the area. Now it's taken over by some other shop!"
"Those speciality skincare shops at city hall and marina Square. I constantly see the sales women offering small packets of sea salt skin care, but rarely see anybody actually buying anything."
"This one ar, my friend in ns bought lol.He was flatter by the female salesperson and bought around 200+ worth.Months later, I ask him so how's the sea salt thing and he told me no use, he also didn't have any success chasing the salesgirl, haha"
F
"Their sales tactic is as follows:Offer 'free' samples to selected women to entice them (basically if you dress nice enough, primarily target OL for obvious reasons)If you take it, you get pulled into their store where they spend the next 20-30 minutes letting you 'sample' their products on one hand so you can compare before and after with your other, untouched handAt the end of it, they ask if you want to buy their set of skincare products which costs $80-100.I'm guessing most people, having experienced it once, turn down the free samples right from the start. How do I know? Speaking from experience here, unfortunately, though I'm thick-skinned enough to say no.So how do they make sales? From all the people who are too paiseh to say no at the end and end up shelling out. Trust me, I know people like those too."
Oh thank god I always decline their samples. That shit is scary.
"No need to decline. You just need to have super thick skin. After you take their sample, just smile, thank them confidently, and walk away. They'll usually try to start their sales pitch but you're not obliged to stay and listen, unless you want to lah."
"Their target is mostly tourist and those gullible about ""free samples"".Suddenly remember responding on a free facial by New York Skin?? around 10yrs ago..I was young and gullible back then, and they told me how handsome am I and begging me from leaving unless i bought their packages, if I said No... then I just have to buy those $50 small oil thingy that u put in ur face (sorry forgot what it's called)"
"Bruh is it Premier ? Tampines One also have, if you dress nice nice like young adult they will pull u in to do experiment with sea salt and the exfoliating effects in the skin . And they try to sell you some cleanser and scrub for $70-$100+ which I obviously can’t afford Cos I’m a teen. And I changed my tactic, I would quickly Siam them or pretend to call someone nowadays but that’s me in sch uni."
"I've also noticed that some of these shops have male, caucasian salesman manning the stalls and giving out samples.What kind of employment pass are they on? Can meh?"
And its always foreign decent looking guys selling stuff.
I used to work for a company that stores and delivers their products every week and their weekly restock requests take us almost 30mins to 1hr to pack per outlet. I think they are selling just not to the locals maybe?
"Beauty world shops, some of the shops there seems untouched for a decade or two but still selling the same things."
"A lot of these shop owners own the strata title, so no rent"
"lol I go to the same watch shop there still from the time I got my first casio watch. (unless I'm buying a watch that's more expensive, then it's Creation Watches.)"
I think Lucky Star is what's keeping the whole building alive.
Precious ThotsEdit: Fml i thought it was Precious Moments lol
THOTS?????!!
So precious amiright
Wtf I googled and it seemed right 😂
they are precious thoughts now
"Yeah, I heard they changed their name because “thot” means a different thing these days... not sure if it’s really true (as in, the reason behind the change)."
"Shame, I like having a little giggle every time I see the storefront."
"It’s got to be Yue Hwa Chinese Products along Eu Tong Sen Street. I have absolutely no idea how they have managed to stay in business for so long given that everytime I’m there, there doesn’t seem to be much customers."
"lots of really rich tourists (from china, indonesia etc) buying expensive stuff there"
"Eh. If you go to peoples park complex, on the 2nd floor there's this supermarket kinda like china china type. The things they sell are damn obiang, and yet, they have been in business for over 50 years. My dad told me it was around since the 60s and totally no change at all. Totally no customers in the shop. Yet they survived longer than most shops that have more business"
"Errr, did you try going on weekends? If anything their business have improved due to PRC workers in Singapore."
Really? Previously I went on a weekend as well. Go see their price tag. It isn't cheap too. Don't think PRC workers will shop there
"I always suspect some of these shops are:Rich kids daddy mummy sponsored shops cos the kid doesn't wanna do a proper job, so become ""entreprenur"". Don't need to make money at all.Some kind of money laundering happening - China / Indonesia / Myanmar general etc need to bring illicit money to Sg safe haven."
"There was a lanshop in taiseng where we’ll head to when got nights off.Everytime we are there, there’s nobody playing at all.A few times we were paying, and there’s no money at all in the register lol.Suspect it’s money laundering haha."
I won't be surprised.
Oh thought of another shop. The one at parkway same floor as Challenger. Sells outdoor furniture. It has been there for quite a while
I bought furniture from there. Guess that's one reason it's alive!
Haha.. was it a big ticket item?
"Not too bad, it was an outdoor swing chair, quality is not bad. They do have sales once in a while which are quite good."
That's good.
Do you still have the swing and how is it?
"It's pretty solid, no creaky sounds after a year."
A good buy then!
"Most toy shops (especially those at Havelock Road, former China Square Central, Peninsula Plaza and Plaza Singapura, Bras Brasah, etc).Kind of surprises me that they able to sell enough toys all the time to cover monthly rental.It's a rather niche hobby and people don't buy toys all the time."
Why not. Used to spend thousands when I was younger on these toys. You’ll be surprised how much spending power otaku have.
what toys?
"Mecha, transformers, figures etc. the biggest issues are house running out of space and dust."
"Okay for those they have a lot of preorders, xiaolang customers who looking for specific things. The one that deals with 2nd hand? no idea."
They probably do online sales as well.
"That mall on Havelock is creepy, half of the units are empty."
"Lol from my experience, you’ll have your collectors who are willing to spend top dollar for their collections.The other ones have started to sell smaller items like blackpink merchandise.. which given the rabid fan base.."
These supposedly high class skincare stores where the sale girls chase you with samples.
"Singapore Press Holdings - apparently the whole country is too poor to pay for a subscription, but somehow they keep churning out more news."
"No newspaper earn from subscription, they earn from selling ad spaces."
"SPH has a property business (clementi mall, paragon and maybe a few others). I think the property segment contributes a majority of its profits although its media segment remains its biggest biz by revenue. In other words, property has way better margins than media."
"They don't earn from selling newspaper subscriptions, they earn from the advertisements companies ask to put in.CNA and TODAY probably already cover most of the news you need."
Don't they also own hostel lodgings in the UK? The revenue from that seems quite steady (i haven't actually looked at the numbers)
They're in the property market! Clementi Mall is one of theirs I think.
"I had taken the weekend subscription for the Straits Times, the entire 3 years I had it they sent the newspaper daily, so that was cool"
"Eu Yan Sang? At least Hockhua has customers who buy their drinks. Every time I walk past an EYS shop, it's either empty or only has 1-2 customers."
Saw a branch in HK. Go figure.
All their herbs they sell to the China tourists margin damm high...
HANG TEN
They are still around??
Spas in shopping centres. Do people really spend $200+++ just for 60 mins of ... spa things?Or am I actually more broke than I realise? :(
"Yes. Some are rich, some are moonlight clan.You cannot afford or cannot bear to part with the money?"
They give a lot of vouchers on Fave and then they trick you into buying additional stuff once they have you in the chair.
Yeah it’s common what. Most girls and some guys have facial and spa packages.
Becos specials.
I don't understand how so many herbal/tonic trading enterprises can survive actually. Won't all the herbs and mushrooms they sell go bad after being exposed to the atmosphere for a week?
"They are dry and if stored well, can keep very long."
"Another one, Hong Seh Motors hehee"
Osim
"Not only is it open, its revenue is >500 million dollars yearly. Like how???"
every massage chair costs 5k++ you dont need many massage chairs to hit target
"Assuming each chair is $5K, and they have a revenue of $500 million. That's 100,000 chairs a year, or roughly 273 chairs a day.They have 16 outlets including their HQ in Singapore. So they have to sell 17 chairs a day. That's almost 1 chair for every hour they are open, consistently."
Got reddiporean buy to massage a certain area.
Like Andy Lau? To massage his aching shoulders?
No. They improvise it for another area.
Tot that is toshiba magic wand?
"Just googled that. Can't remember very well. If I'm not wrong, is improvised from a shoulder or tummy massager. It was quite unexpected."
GNC. I literally never ever see anyone inside one
"Exactly. With iHerb, I wonder how they can still survive. The prices are ridiculous."
GNC price not that ridiculous mah
No lah GNC a lot of people buy. I’m a regular customer and know a few as well. Mostly there for the protein shakesAnd you see the GNC shaker cup everywhere
protein shakesMyprotein 👍🏼
The countless computer part shops at sim lim square. I can see those level 1 shops getting naive customers and big reputable ones getting a steady stream of customers.But I always wonder how all those tiny stores in between make a profit.
Naiise. Admittedly has traffic but I’ve never seen anyone buy anything.
Subway Niche at Wisma. It’s still there right?
They actually have rly good kueh so can understand why it’s still there
I do see people buying stuff regularly tho!
"It was a lifesaver when I worked retail and needed cheap food! Idk how they survive tbh, even with a steady stream of customers, their prices are so cheap I find it difficult to believe they’re able to turn a profit every month."
They are one of the few places that reliably have decent kueh kodok. Its too much of pain to make myself.
"They've been there donkey years. I'm actually very glad that they are still in business. Who knows, maybe the landlord got special rent discount to let them continue operating. Quite possible right?"
"Gym equipment always likely to sell online, and it deliver directly to your house. And they also survive by supplying to construction industry or to gym."
I think for big ticket items they just need to make a few sales a month? The most mysterious one I know of is the dessert stall that used to be at siglap centre. Was there since day 1 iirc. Rarely see customers there but it lasted a long time. I mean at least 10 years before finally being taken over by a Subway
"I know exactly what shop you're talking about at siglap center. The owner was nice though, she closed late for me once because my tuition at Kumon ended late and I wanted ice-kachang.Siglap center used to have more stuff, now it's mostly empty"
Yeah. Used to have country manna and comic book shops and video game shops. Now it doesn't even have a supermarket.
There used to be a yam cake stall near my house and I never saw it open even one time even though I went there at all hours. It was there for nearly a year before it got taken over. I still wonder what was up with that. Maybe a money laundering front for all I know
"Maybe sick, but signed contract already. Last tiagong chong pang carrot cake stall auntie kena cancer, didn't open for a long time."
"I don't see a lot of customers on those places that sells house plants. With the amount of real estate needed for their store, I wonder how they survive."
Vday? =P
"Mother’s Day, Xmas, CNY, birthdays, anniversaries, and actually the profit margin is high enough for flowers."
Flowers ain't cheap.
I’ve bought roses wholesale vs retail. The mark up depending on arrangement and shop can go as high as 600%.

"Sad to say this, but Jigsaw Puzzle World.Not too sure how their online only model has worked over the years..."
Its very easy to “wash” money in singapore.
I asked this before but I can’t quite figure out how ba kwa stalls survive throughout the year.
"Sometimes I gian bak kwa outside of cny so I will buy. I believe there are many more such people out there. Also, I’ve on occasions received bak Kwa for temple celebration goodie bags. Tourists make up the last bulk of people who buy. And very likely that cny period they earn enough for rent for the whole year liao"
TCC (the coffee connoisseur).
"Furniture mall? It is merged with the hotel at some areas with Hawker centre near walking distance? Forgot the name.Forum at orchard and some orchard shops underneath the shopping mall, no one is there except my dad and i, went to browse some chinese antique furniture and display set. There is some orchard shopping mall within walking distance also no one, just airy space. Some boutique stores like krumpler and victoria secret and bookstores also few customers."

"Over the last couple of weeks, many Singaporeans noticed a rather distinct ""smoke"" smell, leading to some thinking that the yearly Indonesian haze came back. However, this isn’t the case. I will try to explain as much details as possible without being too lengthy.(Sorry if i have missed out some details, let me know in the comments! :))It is coming from two sources.One being the Johor Bahru Landfill Fire,the other being the burning of Petrochemicals at Pasir Gudang Industrial Area.Johor Bahru Landfill FireSince 5 February 2019 (Tuesday) , there is a landfill fire happening in Bandar Tenggara, Kota Tinggi District, located in South-Eastern Johor.NEA received feedback about a ""smoky smell"" in the Eastern part of Singapore since 10pm on Friday, 8 February 2019.Because of North-Eastern wind patterns, Singaporeans living in North-East, particularly Punggol, will be severely affected. The wind is also known to have blown the smoke to places such as Ang Mo Kio, Tampines, and even as far as the West of Singapore.With so many feedback and complaints made to the NEA, they have decided to release statements trying to reassure Singaporeans that the situation is under control.""We are closely monitoring the air quality and will provide updates of any further findings or significant change to the air quality situation."" - NEA""Malaysian authorities are working round the clock to stop the burning."" - NEA SpokesmanBurning of Petrochemicals at Pasir Gudanghttps://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ar2yhn/clarifying_the_doubts_of_those_who_see_a_bright/?st=JSKDUYGA&sh=3584aa4dEverything is briefly explained in this post.Do take care of your health and drink up more, as it has reported that the smoke disturbs the eyes and causes breathing difficulties.At the time of the writing of this post (25/2/19, 9:40 pm), PSI levels hover around 51-55 of Singapore, which is in the ""Moderate"" standard of NEA, ranging from 51-100.Sources :https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/burning-smell-due-to-fire-at-landfill-in-johor-neahttps://www.haze.gov.sg/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/burning-smell-in-north-east-singapore-likely-related-to-fire-at-landfill-in-pasir-gudangand various others.side note : thank you u/MochaWaffle for trying to spread good word about what's happening!"
thank you for the write up!was wondering what's up these few days.p.s. 5 * gives you a line.
thanks for the help too! was just hoping i could help some people to figure out what’s happening
Thanks for this! I’ll be sharing your content the next time someone asks about “you smell haze or not harrrrrr?”
I'm not saying they did this on purpose. But the next time they will know how to make us irritated.
"Thanks OP. Again tonight at around 11pm, the burning smell is back again. I've noticed that lately it's always been around this time (10-11pm).If it's the JB landfill fire, it's almost as if those responsible are trying to do it discretely to avoid the Malaysian authorities from finding out."
"“The rich history of the Singapore Jewish community began in the 1830s, almost 200 years ago. There are Jewish families in Singapore today that trace their roots back to Singapore at least 6 generations ago, when their forbears arrived in the very early 1900s from Iraq.” - Rabbi Mordechai Abergel, Chief Rabbi of SingaporeThe first Jews to settle in Singapore were of Baghdadi origin, who migrated from India to Singapore when Raffles established a trading post here in 1819. They were known as Sephardic Jews, and an early colonial census recorded the presence of nine traders in 1830. With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, an influx of Ashkenazi Jews from Europe arrived in search of trading opportunities and to escape persecution in Poland and Russia.The first Jewish Quarters were established in the Boat Quay area, where the first Jewish Synagogue was located in a shophouse. The community later relocated to the areas around Sophia Road, Wilkie Road, Selegie Road and parts of North Bridge Road and Dhoby Ghaut.Though small in number, the Jewish community was a heavyweight in the business sector. By 1846, there were six Jewish merchant houses in Singapore. Notable businessman Sir Manasseh Meyer helped built key synagogues for the community, and also set up a trust fund to help educational and charitable institutions. David Marshall, the first Chief Minister of Singapore, was another notable Jewish personality who was instrumental in the negotiations that led to Malaya’s independence. In the 1940s, the community set up the Jewish Welfare Board to support the community, ranging from education to outreach activities, as well as operating a kosher restaurant in later years.Image from the book ""The Jews of Singapore"" 2007, courtesy of Suntree Media."
I wonder if there were any friction with their business between the Arab Merchants back then.

"Sian, never receive this email. Been with them since 2017 DecEdit: found it. But I can't press on it. Idk why"
"Go check the app. I was trying my luck and saw the banner in the Dashboard - Get Yourself An Upgrade, but no additional information on it though.EDIT: For some reason, I cannot confirm upgrade."
It seems there is some bug on their backend. They told me they’ll resolve it by today
Oh nice. Thanks OP! You deserve a virtual gold
🥇
Same. I've been with them since Sep 2016 as well but nothing :(
"I just signed M1 mySIM20 (12 month contract) at $20/mth for 15GB, 100 outgoing min, 100 sms/mms, free incoming, free caller id. I was also given free 800 outgoing min for porting over. Registration and SIM card fee waived. And now they are offering $5 for 25GB.At $25, it’s much better than what you get for Circles.Life’s $28 base plan."
"That sounds amazing, I'll check it out thanks! Do you think we will we get the same deal after 12 mths if we recontract?"
Hard to say. That depends on the state of the telco war at that point in time. Anyway I plan to sign up with whoever offers me the best deal.
"Thats pretty much a good strategy. Loyalty does not mean as much to a company anymore than price is to a customer. Just checked out the t&c and realise with the caller ID that is waived for the first month, the bill for second month onwards will come to about $30. Still a better deal than CL if CL does not offer the 20gb to old customers"
The caller id is free for the duration of the contract.
Oh! I guess I misread. Thanks for clarifying!
Sad sia is going to be a few more months before i can recontract.
Depends on how competitive the industry is but surely we will get better deals.
I had 3 lines with them since 2017 and they hardly threw me a bone. Only bothered to offer perks to new sign ups. So I ported to M1 last month.This is them reacting desperately to the market.
Ya lor. Keep bombing my email with new sign ups offers. Irritating af.
Check your notification in the app! There should be an option to activate this
Ooh is this for every Circles customer? I don't have it in my app :/
"Same here, dont see any email nor do I have anything regarding this upgrade on the app :S"
Let's give them a day to roll it out. Hopefully it's not just for select customers..
I think they might have stopped the roll out since there are issues with the activation probably want to check back tomorrow when they have fixed it
"Just received an email from Circles:""We decided to give all our customers the experience of what it’s like to live worry-free and enjoy UNLIMITED Data free from 28 Feb, 6pm to 1 March, 8am.""scratch head"

Contract ?
Yeah. 12 mths. Sim only. Online port in gets FOC caller ID.
The real question. NEXT!
NEXT JOKE ORIGIN
Good bot
"This is very attractivr but correct me if I'm wrong, I just googled and it says base data is 5GB, and the free 15GB is for recontract only. Were you already an existing singtel subscriber?"
The base data is 5GB. The additional 15GB is given by singtel. I don't think this is because of recontract. The line was previously under circles.life. I port the number over to singtel.I have a separate Singtel line.
I see that's awesome then. Shall port mine over too. Thanks.
"i dont really understand the offer and a bit afraid to press the confirm. they will really bump my free flexi plan to base plan meh? then next few months i just get free 20GB every month? like a bit dont make sense, can help with explaining?"
I press confirm but there's an error. Live chat said they'll update again when it's working. Anyway it looks like a base upgrade for all users since the PLUS plan (prev 20gb/$20) is already changed to Unlimited/$20.
So now base plan is 20GB/free?
Looks like it's going to be. Just not announced atm.Edit: And if you look at the Circles website its already written there base plan is 20gb.
"Indeed they updated their base plan. But after reading the fine print, this is how it works out:20GB/month is the base plan. This is inclusive of 14GB bonus data per month for one year. So they are adding 14GB to 6GB to give a grand total of 20GB. After 1 year, the plan reverts back to 6GB.Of course, whether they release some other promo after 1 year to retain customers is something to be seen.Another caveat is that this 20GB is only available to the first 10,000 customers. After 10K have signed up, it's back to 6GB/month.9pm Update: I had an in-app chat with Circles. They advised me to delete and reinstall the app to see the promotion. I tried but it didn't work. They told me they will look into it and notify me within the next 1-2 days. I guess maybe the roll out is getting jammed somewhere :P"
"Dang, this is pretty good info. Have an upvote!Hope all ya existing users grab the promo quick!"
Thanks!
Question. Does it go to the bonus or the base? Because mine currently is Bonus 19.6GB+20GB Unlimited+3GB Base
It only mentioned upgrade to base plan. My upgrade hasn't activated cos of the error anyway yet so... not much other details yet.
Let me know once you get it. Very curious
For mine they just added 16gb to bonus
Oh...got the same upgrade too. But they mention base tho which is confusing

To say that ‘a lot’ was demolished would be an understatement, as virtually everything that made Sentosa an idyllic destination was pulverised and concreted over. No more monorail, no more dragons, no more leisurely strolls through the trees and forests, no more picnics - in short, no longer a destination for working-class Singaporeans, but a destination for tourists and the moneyed local and foreign elite."
Sentosa was meant as a resort island ever since we changed the name from Pulau Blakang Mati in 1972. Applying gentrification here seems a bit off since there isn't a native population that was forced to relocate or something. Unlike the neighboring Pulau Brani.
"I see lots of Singaporeans families there on weekends though? There's nothing stopping you from walking across the broadwalk and spending a day at the beach or cycling if that's what you want to do. And the attractions might not be the cheapest, but a price point of ~$25 (which will get you into the waterpark/trick eye/luge) is not out of reach for the majority of people."
There is also the free Palawan Pirate Ship which is like a small waterpark.
Got another island called Pulau Ujong for that
I think it would be a better you do another comparison with the latest satellite image instead of 2008.
"Yeah, all this gentrification is terrible. I long for the days when me and me homie Nila Utama used to hang out in the forests of Temasek hunting Merlions and shit"
"Anyone on here own a classic shophouse? Can be anywhere in SG, not necessarily the chinatown variant, and if you're just renting one i'd like to hear from you too. I'm thinking of getting one with my partner because we have vague dreams of setting up a business / events / living space and since we don't have a house yet or any major bills to pay, i'm suspending rationality for now and just letting the thought ""why not?"" hang around for abit more..I know there are a ton of factors like business plan viability, monthly income, savings, age, family planning, et cetera cetera ceteblablabluhh... but i was just wondering if there's anyone on here who has their own experiences on owning or maintaining one to share. Please feel free to kill my dreams =)"
"I was looking around for an actual house, and one of the options was a shop house unit. They aren't bad choices but well there are pros and cons.Pro- Obviously, really cool historical/cultural value- Price might be surprisingly affordable since they are a niche product that isn't competing with normal units- the facade is usually beautiful.Cons- the layout usually is not modern. So lots of wasted space, corridors that seem to go no where.- very likely that the facade is heritage property and so you can't modify it.- usually in older neighborhoods so parking won't be great (Chinatown seems alright though)"
"IMO :If you have a dream of setting up your own business, try renting a place first. Why ?Buying a commercial property means the following :- You are subjected to TDSR, meaning if in the future you wish to settle down with your other half, you might not be able to get a decent loan for your house- You are subjected to mortgage loans, I am unsure about commercial loans, but i'm suspecting it is pretty high, and with a lot of industries in Singapore not doing so well, renting out might be an issue too- It is a tenant market, tenants have a lot of power in choosing, so why would they want to rent yours if you decide to rent out, just do some research or google for places to rent, plenty of choices- There are already quite a number of companies doing space/event rentals, the idea isn't niche anymore (if that's what you are thinking)- If you decide to sell, you will need to fork out agent fees, which can easily equate to 5 digit loss"
"Don't forget GST too, which is usually on top of quoted price instead of inclusive. As an individual or a non-GST registered company, you won't be able to claim input tax on it."
"Commercial mortgage rates are not too bad compared to residential but you also need to take into account owner-occupied or using it as an investment property.The max LTV, TDSR etc are different for each type."
"Really cool goal. Go for it if you have the means to.Some things to consider based on my second-hand knowledge of shop houses gleaned from grandfather. -depending on location, monthly rental might not be that high (6k-ish for grandfather's shophouse in balestier) but ymmv. -if you're buying, do research on property taxes. Iirc, shophouses attract both residential and commercial taxes. Plus if you do purchase another residential property in future, you'll be subject to absd."
"I used to rent 1. Current rentals in central areas about 20-30k a month for 2000-2500 sq ft.If you wish to rent. Need to standby at least 200k cash.3 mth deposit(90k) . 1 mth rental (30k). Reno cost 50-80k.If you want to buy a shophouse in town area, they are about 5-10 million depending on location and size.If you have 1 to 2 million cash to spare, you can place down payment to buy.Good luck."
How much would such a property be? 1.5-2 million and up?
Are you considering those HDB kinds? Like the first and second storey is shophouse and above are normal housing units?
New HDB estates can hardly reach this stage. The blocks tend to be located much closer to each other and also set very close to the streets. The older estates had more space between blocks and often had more set back from streets so you could have these giant trees growing.
"Yeah if you go amk or sembawang and see it's always road, then 2 meters of grass, then sidewalk, then another 3-5 or so meters grass with trees, then the hdb. The hdb is set back a good 10m from the road.Then go punggol and see it's road, 1m grass, sidewalk, next to the access road, then 1m concrete then hdb.Then there's hdbs literally next to the access ramp onto TPE, don't really know who'd want to live in those. Super dusty and noisy."
"thats the only way to cram 10 million residents onto a tiny island, which is unfortunately the direction we seem to be heading towards..."
"End of MRT linethis.i know land is scarce in Singapore, but it's almost as if in the pursuit of land optimisation, basic comforts and sheer common sense don't matter anymore.We all know how noise and air pollution have a significant impact on mental and physical health. and yet, none of these seem to factor into urban planning these days. not to mention the ever-shrinking flat sizes - something that the government still denies.Punggol and Tengah for example shouldn't have been developed into housing estates, IMHO, due to their proximity to air bases and JB's industrial areas. And yet they're being touted as the next attractive 'place to be'.No choice? Ok I buy the argument. But don't pretend like it's all rosy. At least acknowledge the issue and initiate mitigating counter-measures."
"Crown shyness is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps."
"Our trees are trimmed, but the ""real"" effect is so pretty."
TIL. Gosh
Wow this couldn't be in Singapore?
See botanic garden's rainforest area. That's more natural I think.
I learn a lot from Reddit.
I wonder how they sense the other tree is near and stops growing there.
no homo
"I just wanna say that I fucking love these trees and lucky to live here. Majestic and overwhelming. I think in another place they have lots of these blurry trees that sort of looks like ""green"" snow. Somewhere in Jurong East maybe? I fucking love those too."
"If we're thinking about the same thing.. Yeah, the Taman Jurong area, specifically Yuan Ching Road - Google Street view"
Ooh yess. It really just makes me think it's snowing in the place. The taller and bushy ones have the nicer effect.
"Love them too! Never really seen those trees anywhere else. To me, they look like they're temperate trees, so it almost feels lile a foreign street there. Then with the lake just nearby.. It's a pleasantly dreamy place for a stroll."
The amazing west side streets
"Me too! And that i actively support green efforts in the country. one tree takes many, many years to grow and supports so much life."
Your username is morse code for “OHO”?
"Unintentionally haha, just typed hyphen and underscores for fun"
Are you taking a photo while driving?
Asking the true question right here
"In the spirit of positive thinking, maybe he took the photo when he stopped and waited cos there's an elderly person who's just about to reach the zebra crossing."
"There was a couple approaching from the right pedestrian path, so I stopped, however when I noticed the view was really good, my phone was in my bag, so I asked my rear passenger to reach over and take a shot from my drivers view."
🤔 dont carry it too far eh
Your passenger was almost hugging you from the back
WEST SIDE BEST SIDE
psh.Upper Thompson Road has the best tree lined stretch
what tree?
Wan tu tree
Studied at Rulang Primary a long time ago - this road looked as pretty then as it does now
"same, kids these days wouldn’t be able to relate to dashing across the traffic light to school when its raining bcos theres a shelter built now"
youre right about new HDBs being concrete jungles.. they look wayyyy too urbanised for my liking :(
and then they urban design the fake greenery until its so beautiful but it's like all man made and i don't know how to feel about it
Nah it’s just the trees haven’t had time to grow big. These giant jurong trees were once saplings as well. If you look at any new hdb it’s a ton of saplings obviously since you can’t easily transplant big ass trees without them dying half the time.
"it's not about the young trees though, new estates are just so crammed/cramped that theres no space for trees to flourish like the old estates.They've tried to get round this by putting rooftop gardens and green walls, but these definitely don't look as good and are very obviously an artificial fix."
I don’t agree. The green space integration is much better for new estates. If you notice older estates are bland concrete jungles albeit spaced further apart. You seem to be referring to big old trees lined straight in a row along a boulevard as natural as well.
"That's actually JW st 52 but yeah, there's nothing quite like the raintrees there."
"Thanks for pointing out! You are right , I’m always confusing between these 2. Not sure if you all remember, I miss the Seow Choon games on jw st51"
"Seow Choon gamesNow that's a name I've not heard in a long, long time"
Wow thats beautiful
"similar streets like this I love: tanglin halt road, jalan kayu"
yea... young trees. you got to wait for the trees to grow to the point where their branches and leaves about to start touching each other.
It’s okay as long as they say “no homo” right?
I loved the trees along side the roads in Singapore.
Here's the start of 2km of trees for youEdit: wtf they cut down so many already
"AMK used to be like this. Until AMK Hub, Thomson Line and several other projects came along.Treasure it while you can, because the government won't."
rip jurong spring cc mac
ikr. jurong green cc mac is so far & not 24/7(except weekends n ph)
I also see this as I drive down ecp to the airport. I can’t remember which part of the ecp it is but it warms my heart and reminds me how beautiful our home is.
I could tell straight away that it was near my street. Is there any other place in Singapore like this?
"My kindergarten days were in dakota crescent, and this is exactly how it used to be.Now it's no more...We lived in a 2 room, 1 hall flat and I kid you not, our bedroom was a big as a present 1 room house flat and had a good protruding balcony facing the old lasalle college...Evening time, I used to go to the Chinese uncle shop opposite my flat and buy the Styrofoam air planes and bomb bag.Beside my house was the skeleton dragon playground. Didn't have any friend at that time, so I would play alone...Hmmmmm... Those were the days and saying this here, I feel like I'm a grandpa telling stories to little kids!!!"
"So beautiful, thanks. This just brought me back when I was small and the entire Dover Avenue, the road between the church on one side and Spore Poly on the other, used to have the same tree canopies.It looked magical, unreal even, that left by itself, nature would just form something like that.Thanks for the photo that made me remember when I was a kid."
Funny that I just drove there looking for free parking Sunday. Nothing much to makan on Sunday evening..
"Dude Jurong West St 52 is clearly superior don't @ me. The canopy is GORGEOUS there.It has the damn good value 528 Zhi char, the market oppo it, the CC that screens world cup matches, the SG pools next to the CCAnd this bookstore i opened a foil Charizard in."
With that old civic you can tell me this is taken more than 10years back and i'll believe.
"absolutely adore walking through old estates, just feels like home yknow"
"""Concrete Jungle where dreams are made of, there's nothing you can do!!"""
"Mature estates are absolutely gorgeous. There's a similar looking stretch along Telok Blangah Crescent. Narrow road with tall trees, HDB blocks and market by the side."
I’ve been going there once every single week for almost 19 years now and I’ve Never actually noticed and realised how pretty that street was until now! I feel like some ungrateful bastard😂
I heard those tree is much easier to disease and rot. Which is why you don't see those much anymore
the tips are not touching each other so its okay.
"I tried to walk through there once in the morning, and wound up late for work by half an hour. Jurong is really a lot bigger than most people think. And this is old Jurong West."
"This is that stretch on the 335 route, just before Grace Orchard(?), formerly Rulang Primary, iirc."
This is street 52 by the way

"Hey guys using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I recently moved over from Australia by myself to do my national service and am having a tough time adjusting to the whole army culture as well just Singapore in general. I have come to terms with having to do service and am just looking forward to getting it done and heading to university to join my friends.So I was posted to infantry trooper after bmt where I was staying in for a few months. Eventually I couldn’t handle staying anymore, my appetite had gone, I felt trapped and horrible all day. I was just feeling incredibly stressed and all my friends notices that I was constantly feeling down. The MO has given me excuse stay in until I can go see the PCC?I went to see a psychologist and was diagnosed with Depressed mood with adjustment disorder.I was just wondering firstly what is depressed mood, is that the same as depression? Secondly, what is the PCC all about? I would like to continue to stay out as it has honestly greatly improved my mood. I’m happy to come to work in he mornings and I find myself laughing and joking around again. Will the PCC listen to me honestly and consider that? (Sorry for any formatting mistake I don’t post often)Thanks in advance!"
"Ngl, thought it was about depression and a different sort of pcc."
"Playing Chinese Chess can be very stressful, too many toxic players lusting to win and too intense on beating the game."
Well pcc DOES help when you're feeling down.
Different sort of pcc cannot unsee already. Noted with thanks.
Same yoConfused to see MO etc???
"For the benefit of others who think PCC refers to ahem ahem, it actually stands for Psychological Care Center (PCC), situated at the Military Medicine Institute. In other words, a place which houses our SAF psychiatrists.My guess is that the PCC visit is to allow a specialist to 1) determine severity of your mental health problem 2) formulate a treatment plan suitable to you 3) recommend a course of action to your military superiors. I think you should share your honest opinions with the PCC psychiatrist, like how how staying out improves your mood, the cause, when you start feeling this and what not. Also, a heads up about first visits. It can seem a little ""clinical"" and not very empathetic at times; a lot of questioning, clarifications. So don't be too bothered by it! Hope the visit goes well!EDIT: With regards to the difference between Depressed mood with adjustment disorder and depression, they are not the same thing. In the mental health field, diagnoses are given based on a checklist approach of symptoms. The term depression has a pretty specific criteria, where depressed mood is one of the criteria. Same too with adjustment disorder. The term ""depressed mood"" alongside the adjustment disorder is to indicate the subtype of adjustment disorder. There are other types such as anxiety, mixed anxiety and depression. Note I am a bit rusty since I have left the mental health field for a while so let me know if I have made any mistakes. This is not professional advice."
what's ahem ahem?
Masturbation. PCC is slang for wanking.
"Ya, I thought op was gonna talk about that. Then wonder why talk about depression lol"
Play Chinese chess?
Dear OP. This post is really accurate. Source: am an ex-PCC staff.

"NS is a pretty shitty experience even for locals, can't imagine how it is for you. I used my time in army to lift weights and bulk up using the free food and the boost in testosterone and fitness helped me feel better. You can consider doing something similar."
how do you find time to gym in the army though

"PCC is Psychological Care Center and it's situated at the Military Medicine Institute (as mentioned by another comment). MMI are basically the guys that are in charge of all the medical centres at the camps. Basically at PCC you'll be evaluated by a psychiatrist (whom I don't believe is actually part of SAF but I could be wrong). Depending on their diagnosis they will try to help you in recovery which can range from a permanent stay out status to even downPESing if necessary. From all I've heard about them you'll be treated nicely there, at least by the psychiatrist. And yes, do mention that staying out has improved your mood as they will definitely take that into consideration. Good luck, hope you feel better!"
Staying out is quite common for a large variety of issues. You should be posting out of Infantry or transferred to a clerk role though if they decide to let you stay out permanently.
"I dont have to serve NS, but thanks to all you guys who had to join up. Stay strong"
When I realized OP meant different sort of PCC I got depressed.
"Most of the questions you're asking can only be answered by a medical professional in the psychiatric field.PCC is the Psychological Care Center, a branch of the MMI portion. The doctors there have mostly (if not all) previously specialized in psychiatry during their studies.During the (first) consultation session another more experienced doctor (at consultant level) will sit in and discuss the less experienced doctor's diagnosis and make suggestions if needed. You can help yourself my letting your PCC follow up doctor know if there's any improvement since your referral and at the point of the PCC visit, and what is helping you improve your situation etc."
Have you tried talking to ur section commander/platoon commander about your problem? I believe they will do their best to help you with your needs.
I’m not really a very outspoken person. The less people I can deal with about this the better to be honest. At this point I just want to see this PCC and see if he will upgrade my stay out to permanent.
"Try to speak to your commander and let him know your issue.If possible, you might get a vocation where you stay out. So at least you can go back to your home."
"I love how you use ""Upgrade""Hello Sir, can I have an upgrade to vehicle transport only."
I don’t have any problems with any vocations to be honest. I wouldn’t mind doing literally anything. I’ve found the best way for me to de-stress and just have that nice few hours of break away from camp really helps me.
I mean if you have a problem with staying in then you clearly do have a problem with quite a few vocations. Not trying to downplay your issues but you can't be in a vocation where everyone else has to stay in but you get to book out everyday.
The best way is to transfer him to a vocation where it's like an 8-5 job. Maybe mess boy or something.
Yahahhahahahahahaa
Hi! I would like to add that the doctors in PCC are very kind and understanding to your condition. You can tell them truthfully whatever problem you are facing and they will try their best in their power to help.
"Well, NS is a shitty experience and you're right to feel depressed. There's no way to sugarcoat it, but you need to tough it up."
"I’m not even asking for much. I’ve relocated my entire life to move to a country where I knew 2 people and that was my family. The culture is completely different, the weather is the opposite of what I’m used to. I’m already giving up 2 years of my life for a country I have literally no feelings towards or attachments to and all I’m asking for is to be able to sleep in my own bed at night and use WiFi so I can call my family and friends back home without worrying constantly about data limits."
Well that’s what happens when one goes from living in an awesome country to a shitter of a country. Why else are there so many Singaporeans migrating down under?
This is blatant propaganda
Which part of it is false?
"https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/research-brief-125.pdfNo correlation between marijuana legalisation and traffic deaths. I believe the number of traffic accidents in colorado was already increasing when legalisation happened.2) I don't believe the hospitalisations are for serious complications more than it is for lack of education of marijuana's effects. It's easier to die from an overdose of water than an overdose of marijuana.3) See above. Although it isn't researched as extensively and studies are not consistent on its side effects, Alcohol and cigarettes have well documented effects and will definitely kill you if you use them extensively.4) If your child is exposed to them, then that's bad parenting, not the fault of marijuana edibles. Common sense would tell you that nobody is going to hand out snacks laced with pot to random children, and it's the fault of the parent if they are exposed to them because the edibles are not kept properly.5) Hilarious. Do you think the demand will be such as there will be 2x more weed shops in singapore than mcdonalds?7) Do you think children can go into a cannabis store and just buy some edibles?8) I believe after increasing the penalties for sale to minors, oregon merchants became stricter in checking IDs and achieved a 100% compliance rate.9) I don't see anyone protesting bars and convenience stores selling cigarettes near schools, so how is a medical marijuana dispensary any worse? Besides, you still need to get ID'd before you can purchase it.10) Shitty emotional jab. Can't believe the person who made this was on a paycheck.It's fine to argue against marijuana legalisation, but putting out false information and propaganda isn't the way to do it."
"Literally just had this steaming pile of garbage appear as an ad on a YouTube vid I was watching.One sided and misleading, with poorly made arguments. Not to mention a really cheap emotional jab at the end of the ad.I’m not even saying that cannabis or cannabis products should be legalised here. Just the sheer misinformation and audacity of this video is pissing me off.Stop telling people WHAT to think. Give them ALL the facts and let them form their own opinions."
Lol pretty much every argument made in the video is applicable to alcohol as well
Yes but alcohol has a nice little tariff attached to any imports.
Alcohol related health problems and crime probably cost the government more than what they get from tax. It's easier to keep an something illegal than to make something legal illegal.
Ganja also can tax what..
now what?
I thought fake news were illegal in SG ?
CNB would like to know everyone's location
"yeah don b sillyu can get stoned by skipping sleep.. for free! it's cool, just ask the adults who did the same from their childhood to now"
More pot shops than Macdonalds. I guess it’s ok for more fast food outlets/snot pro cannabis
So.. Why don't we ban alcohol also?

It’s gone
Oh no
Not like this
When did they demolish the chalets?
"About a year ago, which is why this post is kinda silly. Almost everyone should remember them if you are from that area. They haven’t been gone that long"
Yeah about a year ago lol. I still remember how they went from costa sands to goldkist which was quite shit
"I quite nostalgic about these old places in Singapore, and was doing some googling about ECP chalet recently. Couldn't believe that it's gone."
Didn't realise they were demolished... I remember walking the whole stretch of ECP quite a few years back and they were still there...
"Yea, i could have sworn that it was there a few months ago..."
"Yes, remember it very clearly. Lost my virginity there."
Oh no i went to check your profile.... Sighs

I vaguely remember going there when I was a kid.
"wait it's gone?!sincerely,the west"
Omg seeing this pic makes me feel nostalgic
cool. but this place got hella gross by the end
COASTA SANDS RESORT!
This was the road marker fore whenever bicycle at ecp.
"Yea I loved that place, went there at least 4 or 5 times during my childhood :) so much memories including locking my whole family outside the chalet because I left the key card inside! Hahah"
Man Costa sands Resort. Still remember about this place back during my teens.Also haunted as fuck.
"Ah yes that place, good riddance. Near the end of its time it was super filthy, cramped, and overpriced. Its only saving grace was its proximity to the beach but after a while it just couldn't compete"
Management was shit. I hear horror stories of roaches and bed bugs
Was not bad when it was newer. So hard to make a booking then!
oh wow. my family stayed at a cheaper one but I remember seeing this and thinking how nice it looks
Walked past there during my POP route march
Are chalets out of style now? What’s going to take its place?
Never went there before but I remember one episode of some horror/supernatural TV show every friday/Saturday night that showcase this. It was about the lady with wet footprints I think.
I thought the chalet trend ended in the 90s. Surprised it survived so long.
Ah... Memories.
Legend
Damn. We made memories there.
Nostalgic
all i remember is cockroach haven
One of the worst and dirtiest chalet ever
I loved that place. It was the few things that made me happy here in sg. Just relaxing with the family and having fun. Hais
It's still there right? Abeilt half rotting
Heh. Damm. Long time ago.
Ah...all the fingerings..... can never foget.
As someone who lives in that area I swear this is the dirtiest chalet ever... Also feels a bit haunted (although personally I think aloha is more haunted). Lots of bengs and lians had their parties there back in those days.
A lot of our childhood haunts are slowly disappearing. le sigh
LoveNest
I did not realise it was demolished! My parents live 5 mins away and I lived overseas but went back last year. We used to have our secondary school gatherings there. Good times.
I have a old street directory where they still advertise for this but it was called NTUC Pasir ris Resort(?)
Pre transfer maybe? Pretty sure this and the downtown east had the same owners
Isnt it still open? http://goldkist-beach-resort.bestsingaporehotels.net/en/
"No, recently torn down"
Oh :(
"And to start, huge respect to you folks in red and blue dealing with real life scenarios that the boys in green wouldn't experience, because I know, its not easy to deal with real life cases where every action could be a life or death situation.Also, how do you deal with some of these situations after the incidents?"
"Used to do SPF Ops Room, one time a pick up carrying those cooking gas got reported missing and all the senoir officer has to come down because they thought it was stolen for terrorism. Was quite an eye opener, turned out the driver forgot where he parked it and panick."
Reminds me of the time in HWZ someone posted a new thread asking for help to locate his 'stolen' car.Apparently he just forgot where he parked hahahhaa
"my first arrest - drug offender at a bus interchange. normal screening. was waiting for him to put food items into his backpack. he saw us and dropped everything. bend down to pick things up and act like nothing happened. he begged, cried, shout, cursed. was really shocked/surprised/speechless by the whole ordeal.my first reservist - last shift of the cycle. man possessed. 6 ppl in the back of the ambulance surrounded by a police escort to IMH.also honorable mention - part of the trump kim summit. :D"

paya lebar airport was the spot
Were you from transcomm?
yes
"Haha, guessed so. Thanks for keeping our public transportation safe!"
Are they allowed to talk about it on social media under OSA though?
"Of course, its going to be a big nono. As long as they do not contain sensitive info I think it should be fine?"

Just a reminder not to breach OSA.

this is outrageous!!
Not too bothered as I'm sure MBS gets all the publicity it needs...
"Mbs is a building but also a ship. I remembered watching ""the day after tomorrow"" when it was built and told myself, ""i will study hard and get on that then the flood comes""Best building/ship 😗"
"tbh, there is nothing special about MBS... it's just three buildings with a massive cantilevered thing on the top"
"Dude... I want you to think about what you said really hard.MBS is the second most costliest building ever made, if im not wrong."
"heh, cost is not quality or synonymous with being ""avant-garde"""
Alright perhaps..but that doesn't mean MBS isn't a pinnacle of architecture

welcome to the devil’s ring...
Sssssshhh... Don't hurt my flat's valuation anymore.
You are targeting the wrong buyers. There might be a couple of serial murderers or siao langs out there who’d pay a pretty penny to live in Yishun near their brethren. Oh and Satanists too
Can confirmSource: Am serial killer
Inb4 a monster comes out of the pond and ends Yishun
Monsters don't stand a chance against Yishun
True dat
Would be interesting to see though.
Satanic residents might have a small chance against monsters.
"Missed deliveries, lost packages and delayed shipments are the bane of every online shopper.And these problems - which had surfaced during the just-concluded seasonal peak - could well increase if steps are not quickly taken, warn logistics players.One measure already in the pipeline is a partnership between SingPost and some of its competitors to offer customers the option of receiving purchases through any delivery node in the network. Called The Last Mile Platform, it will be rolled out next month.Such alliances may be unusual. But it cannot be business as usual.SingPost saw its postal system strain under the pressure of the recent peak season. It saw volumes surge by 30 per cent, double what it expected. On average, it already delivers about three million items a day.And this volume of deliveries, predicts SingPost group chief executive Paul Coutts, will become the new normal in six months.Until very recently, e-commerce penetration in Singapore had ""actually been quite low"", Mr Coutts told The Straits Times in a recent interview.""But I really believe that it's now accelerating and taking off.""According to a 2018 study by Google and Temasek, Singapore's e-commerce market, which stood at US$1.8 billion (S$2.43 billion) last year, is predicted to grow to US$5 billion by 2025.Nanyang Business School adjunct associate professor Zafar Momin said that with just 5 to 6 per cent of shopping transacted online in Singapore, e-commerce penetration here may appear relatively low compared with countries like China (20 per cent) and Britain (16 per cent). Singapore's e-commerce sector is, however, expected to show double-digit growth over the coming years, he said.Related StoryPunggol and Bukit Panjang residents can collect online purchases from lockers at HDB blocks in pilot schemeRelated StorySingPost to add Park N Parcel collection points to its new last-mile platformRelated StoryCelebrating Singapore's entrepreneurial spirit: The Ninja way to efficient deliveryLazada, one of the region's biggest e-commerce players, said that sales for the Singles' Day event last year were three times that of the year before. Its chief executive in Singapore James Chang said it had seen a 60 per cent increase in smaller local businesses joining as sellers in recent months, helping to drive the industry's ""tremendous growth"".Mr Prashant Dadlani, chief executive of retail logistics start-up blu, noted that rapid growth is not necessarily sustainable, adding that e-commerce now ""is fuelled heavily by promotions, price discounting and cross-subsidising"".Mr Erik Cheong, co-founder of Park N Parcel, which has 1,600 collection points, is even more blunt.In the overcrowded market, he said, ""many third-party logistics providers are offering services at a low rate with thin margins or even making a loss per delivery"".There are now dozens of operators offering thousands of collection points across the island. But the market is fragmented and messy, while intense competition for resources calls for more industry collaboration, players said.Parcel Santa, which provides parcel locker services to 300 condominiums in Singapore, started in 2017. Co-founder Jim Huang said that while traditional retail relies on malls and shops as consolidation points for goods, online shopping sees the delivery of goods to individual doorsteps, which is unsustainable.The only way for logistics to keep pace with e-commerce growth is to re-establish ""consolidation points"" such as parcel lockers, he said.While there will always be demand for doorstep deliveries as a premium service, he said the future blueprint for last-mile delivery in Singapore will likely be a hybrid model that includes lockers and community-based deliveries.While there will always be demand for doorstep deliveries as a premium service, he said the future blueprint for last-mile delivery in Singapore will likely be a hybrid model that includes lockers and community-based deliveries.Courier services are also finding ways to beat the manpower crunch and reduce missed deliveries.Ninja Van, for example, has a network of about 1,000 pick-up and drop-off points, including neighbourhood shops, in addition to offering doorstep deliveries.On-demand delivery platforms like GoGoVan, which has a registered fleet of 20,000 in Singapore, and GrabExpress, which rolled out its beta trial here last year, rely on shared resources.GrabExpress uses GrabFood's motorcycle fleet, allowing the riders to ""reduce idle time and earn more income"", a spokesman said.Some operators feel there should be greater collaboration in the industry, especially during peak seasons.The Last Mile Platform, as well as the Locker Alliance, are leading the charge to create a more cohesive delivery network for consumers in a highly competitive space, where some players are at risk of suffering losses.SingPost's Last Mile Platform will integrate partner courier services, parcel lockers and collection points in all South-east Asian countries, and allow retailers to offer customers the option of receiving purchases through any delivery node in the network.The Locker Alliance is a government initiative to break down the barrier of locker operators having separate computer systems and tie-ups.A year-long pilot was rolled out in December which lets customers of online retailers such as Lazada and Qoo10 have their items delivered to any of the 62 locker sites at Housing Board blocks in Punggol and Bukit Panjang, as well as at eight MRT stations.Mr Christopher Ong, managing director of DHL Express Singapore, which is part of the pilot, said that rolling it out across the island will ""give customers more options as well as a more consistent user experience""."
"Hi! Im a foreign student taking my bachelor here in Singapore and I wanted to start working out and get fit. Im a student on a budget and therefore am looking for gyms with a cheap membership. Ive been looking around online and fount that ActiveSG has the lowest membership fees being $30/month. But as I further read on the membership requirements, it says that the membership is strictly provided for Singaporeans and PR. So, does this mean i cant buy the membership? And is there any other gym with good offers?As the deal is attractive, i decided to check on one of the ActiveSG gym located in Toa Payoh. The place looked good enough and i wanted to ask the staff some questions but i couldnt find the reception or anyone whos working at the entrance. Thus i left the place without gaining informations on the gym. Im pretty sure i am supposed to register and buy the membership through the App but i want to confirm it with people who are familiar with this. And lastly, how do i enter the gym if i register online ? (i wont get an ID card?) Do i tap in through the gate with my phone? The gyms in my hometown are very traditional and therefore i have no idea on entering the gym here in Singapore.Thank you :)"
Have you checked if your university has a gym?
"Yes, it does have one but its a very small gym. 3-4 people in there and working out becomes really uncomfortable."
Not sure about membership but you enter the gym by scanning a bar code on the app itself
"I see, thank you sir"
"There are a couple of ways to ""enter"" the gym. You can scan your IC/student card/any card which has your IC in bar code form, key in your IC number at the counter, scan a qr code provided in the app etc. These are all linked to your IC number.If you have a good friend who doesn't mind, you can borrow his card to scan, key in his nric, log in to the app through his account etc. Though his account has to have some money first so that the entrance fee can be deducted. Most of the time, the gym staff don't actively check for identification."
I think ActiveSG wouldn't be that different from your University's gym.It is usually very pack.
Other alternatives would be Anytime Fitness or Gymbox. They are expensive but you can negotiate for cheaper prices if you register a long term contract.
The true “Keyboard Warriors” of SAF.
"Not bad sia. Can go for academic courses while on NSF and everything you learn is transferrable outside. Can help to build ur portfolio for future employment or further studies.Rather than going combat vocation, what useful thing u learn other than fitness?"
How to drive a truck?cries in corner
Yea thats a useful vocation if can convert to civilian license. But are you gonna work as grab/go jek or lorry delivery men after ord?
So those in this scheme are specialists who will receive regular pay after their NSF phase (for the duration of their contracts)?
Means sign on la
"If the 3 year contract is 2 years NSF + 1 year regular, then i think quite decent because that 1 year regular pay can actually pay for university studies in local uni. If 3 year contract starts after 2 years NSF, then might not be as good but that would depend on how many module exemptions are granted to those who study related courses in uni."
"They never mention the sign on bonus how much or whether there is or not. It is 2years NSF + 1year regular. Most chose 2 years regular. Also dk if the pay is as high as those combat units anot. But still not bad la. In the end, you gain useful experience and transferrable skills."
"Just another form of outsource technical work to reduce headcount. NC$ / $T have been doing it for a long time. Hire 1-2 full timer and fill the team with cheap contract workers.Both MHA and SAF have NSF “it security” position for a long time. More of gloried secretary answering call / email while help to keep a look out on the system while the regulars / full timer disappear 2-3 hours for break.There is a vast difference in the security sector between SG companies / gov vs Western companies in terms of operation and salary. MOH incident is a prime example, definitely won’t be the last.This just for PR or another white elephant project for someone to get promoted."
man i applied for this so i really wanna get in to this.
"Worth goal for opposition, I wish them luck"
"I support a strong opposition in Singapore, but unfortunately unless the they are willing to put their agenda aside for a common goal and follow a common leader, it is highly unlikely to happen."
"With the quality of the opposition now, I would rather prefer the ruling party continue ruling."
That why deny PAP 2/3 majority and not denying PAP majority.PAP gained their position as the governing party but denying them 2/3 majority is to prevent them to amend the Constitution as they wish.
"I believe a good opposition should be able to select and reject proposals that do not benefit the masses, and accept the proposals that do benefit.However, some proposals may cause unhappiness or pain in the short run, but beneficial in the long run. Right now, my current opinion is more inclined towards believing that the current opposition does not have the knowledge nor experience to distinguish good from bad and may end up rejecting proposals that benefit the country in the long run in order to cater to populist views.Plus, what comes next after winning? Its still a question mark whether they will be able to agree on the same goal after that. The united opposition that toppled UMNO is already showing signs of disagreements and cracks.Just my 2 cents on this matter. You may all now start downvoting. Tyvm"
"However, some proposals may cause unhappiness or pain in the short run, but beneficial in the long run. Right now, my current opinion is more inclined towards believing that the current opposition does not have the knowledge nor experience to distinguish good from bad and may end up rejecting proposals that benefit the country in the long run in order to cater to populist views.Which is why normal laws only take 50.1% vote to pass. The opposition aiming to deny 2/3 majority which prevents the government from amending the constitution, latest example of it being them amending it to make it a Malay-only selection. Of course, the opposition can always block the important (and necessary) amendments of the Constitution.With more opposition (but still less than 50%) being in parliament, they would also get more experience. The ruling party's method currently is to deny them any experience, then say they have no experience so vote for us. While I don't expect PAP to give free lessons and free seats to opposition, it is in the country's best interest to have more experience and diversity.Lastly, I admit that it is quite unreasonable to vote opposition to give them the chance for gain experience too. The country's not a learning platform for them. But to deny the 2/3 majority is indeed favourable to the country as it seems that it has been used unnecessarily in recent times."
"Don't fall for the narrative that the opposition always choose the populist choice. Remember which party is handing out $300 GST vouchers willy-nilly.Any politician (and person) has their vested interests. Remember the 'public servants' who ran off to fireworks celebrations when a son of Singapore died for nothing, and put a rich man's funeral before our hero."
"Well, I believe I can read and make decisions on my own without relying on the narrative.No one is perfect, but at the end of the day, its about choosing the lesser of two evils."
"However, some proposals may cause unhappiness or pain in the short run, but beneficial in the long run.More often than not, this is just a narrative perpetuated by the govt to push through unpopular policies. Much like the ""Singapore is very vulnerable so we need to mantain stability"" narrative.Unpopular policies are not always good, and popular policies are not always bad. After all, who is best able to judge whether a policy is ""beneficial"", a scholar-general-minister who will probably never feel the effects, or the general population who will see whether his life is made better or worse and support policies accordingly? ""Knowledge and experience"" comes from many sources, and is not a monopoly of the ministerial clique. The use of ""populist"" as a perjorative label is a very simplistic way of ignoring dissent and alternative views.Moreover, what does ""benefit the country"" mean anyways? Does ""the country"" mean statistical indicators like the GDP or does it mean the lives of people themselves. Take the migration issue for example, sure it fuels our economy, but it also has other more intangible consequences on space, stress and the pace of life. Certaintly many would trade a few GDP percentage points points for a little more breathing room.Would you prefer to let some minister make these choices behind closed doors, or would you prefer scrutiny and debate so you can decide for yourself."
Most policy only need simple majority to pass.Singapore opposition parties are nowhere near mature enough to govern Singapore.Having more opposition MP without changing the governing party would not even give them a chance to vote out such said proposals.
"The point I'm trying to make isn't to oppose having more opposition in the Parliament, but rather, if you let an opposition into Parliament, make sure he/she is a good and capable person that has good track record in terms of ability and conduct.In this current situation however I do not think that most are ready for it yet. Only a handful in my opinion are qualified for the role."
"Well, my counter point to this is that I hope you apply the same standards to the PAP candidates - where there are many utterly forgettable people who get sent into Parliament on the backs of Ministers who are running in the same GRC team.The truth of the matter is that under our current system of parliament, individual MPs don't really count for much. Parties vote along their manifesto lines, and then whip all MPs to vote according to the party. The opposition would need a core of good thinkers, and the rest are simply there to vote.If we start making these ""good and capable person"" requirements then it would be nice to see them applied to the PAP too."
"Yes, but lets say you remove all the incapable ones from the ruling party and the current opposition now and compare.I personally would feel that they will be more capable ones in the ruling party currently."
"I think this comparison is a little besides the point, since it already shows that you are willing to give the PAP more leeway in terms of the number of incapable members.Besides, I really find it difficult to agree with your view. Silvia, LTK, and Pritam are all solid MPs. Even by this basis, the WP would have a 50% rate of having good MPs over forgettable/lousy ones.The PAP has 82 people in Parliament. Can you even just name 42 PAP MPs by memory, much less identify whether they are good/bad? I'd be pretty surprised if the average Singaporean can even identify everyone who is in cabinet."
"It is the Party label that gives the 'nameless' PAP candidates credibility. After all PAP did build SG over 50 years to 1st world status. This legacy is the reason - the ""track record"" - why most voters give PAP more leeway than the Opposition.By the way, it's also Party label that allows a newbie WP candidate a 5-10% lead against a non-WP oppo new candidate in most votes."
"Would agree with LTK and pritam. But Sylvia, not so much. And I wasn't only referring to the ones in Parliament. I meant as a whole. Including the ones who aren't elected.Besides WP, can you name some other capable ones from other parties? In my opinion probably Nicole seah only if she's still in politics."
Or the reverse: focus on the good ones and count how many you'd trust as ministers.
"When i think about a strong opposition, the only one i can think of is WP. And even they are barely hanging on to their stronghold.SDP probably isnt in the right place to unite the opposition parties in sg.I think even WP will need another one or two terms to stabilise before expanding their influence. As for SDP, win a SMC or GRC first la."
"""I've done my waiting! Twenty years of it! In Hougang!"" - LTK"
"Pritam better not deviate from Low's path if WP is to consolidate well for the next GE.WP is relevant because they're disciplined (don't accept party hoppers) & their mantra is to represent the people (& not became a marriage of convenience for activists with personal agendas).It was telling when, for the 2013 Punggol East by-election, SDP infamously proposed to WP about fielding a joint candidate & let SDP be the voice in Parliament while WP run the town council. Talk about exposing yourself. They rightfully received online flak & WP rightfully rejected the laughable offer."
Tbh the most pressing hurdel for wp is surviving the lawsuit agasint them. Pritam is amazing but he's not going to be able to run if he's bankrupt.
after being denied a venue?
Which GRC is willing to give up it's town council to achieve this goal of preventing the PAP for getting 2/3 majority?
"When will CSJ ever stop having delusions of grandeur and gain some self-awareness?He is a major contributing factor to why the opposition in Singapore have no credibility and the sooner he shuts his mouth and exits politics, the sooner we will get to a more balanced parliament."
"There are quite a few people that I know of who strongly believe that CSJ is nothing more than a planted mole to sow discord and discredit the opposition. The more I look at it, the more this conspiracy theory looks credible. Then again, CSJ could just be an utter idiot with a bad case of narcissism."

Hi can you add Lovelyz concert in Singapore 17/03 at Zepp @ Bigbox! https://www.apactix.com/events/detail/lovelyz-2019
"Hi r/singapore, my focus this week will be on the ducks of Singapore.Our waterfowl species diversity isn’t very high. We have the Lesser Whistling Duck, an uncommon and locally threatened species that has been recorded from wetlands in various locations across Singapore. Most are seen in ponds and marshes with dense vegetation. Some locations where this species can be seen include the ponds at the Botanic Gardens, Gardens by the Bay, Lorong Halus, and Kranji Marshes. It has also been recorded from places like Sungei Buloh, West Coast Park, and Pulau Ubin. The flocks of Lesser Whistling Duck seen around the Flamingo Lake and other waterbodies at Jurong Bird Park might be wild too.Lesser Whistling Ducks are sometimes seen with young, and one family even took a walk around town in 2017.The Cotton Pygmy Goose is much rarer compared to the Lesser Whistling Duck; it’s still not certain whether this species is a very rare resident that stays here all year round, or an occasional visitor from neighbouring countries. So far, there have been no local breeding records. Like the Lesser Whistling Duck, this species favours heavily vegetated freshwater habitats like ponds and marshes. Recent sightings have taken place in Kranji Marshes, MacRitchie Reservoir, and a pair even popped up for a day at Gardens by the Bay. Most recently, an individual was seen at Lorong Halus in December 2018, and another one was seen at a pond in the Seletar Air Base area in January this year.We have another species of duck that is known to be breeding here in Singapore, although it’s not a native species. The Wandering Whistling Duck looks a lot like the Lesser Whistling Duck, but with some subtle differences in plumage. This species is native to the Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea, Australia, and some of the Pacific Islands, and the populations found in Singapore are thought to have originated from birds that escaped or were released from captivity. They can be found most easily in the Botanic Gardens and Gardens by the Bay, often forming mixed flocks with Lesser Whistling Ducks. It’s possible that some hybridisation is taking place between both species.Feel free to ask any questions you might have about ducks, and I'll try to answer them to the best of my ability. You can also share your own stories and anecdotes, or suggest other animals for me to cover in future.Previous edition: Malayan Colugo"
Come to think of it I’ve not seen wild ducks ever in sg. Only in the zoo and in farms.
"I've seen a few at Orto in Khatib.Not sure if wild, I've just seen them walking around in the grass"
"Migratory WaterfowlApart from the 3 species of waterfowl mentioned above, there are a number of other species that occasionally make an appearance here. These are ducks that breed in temperate climates, and migrate south during the winter months. Although most of the Asian populations of these species overwinter in India, Indochina, and southern China, there have been sightings of various migratory duck species in Singapore, most likely involving small numbers that strayed from the usual migratory route.These include the Northern Shoveler – lone birds were spotted at Sungei Serangoon in November 1983, December 1993, December 1999, and January to February 2000. A pair was seen at Poyan Reservoir in November 1988, a male showed up at Sungei Buloh in November 1997, and a female made an appearance at Sungei Buloh in December 2008.Garganey – This species was previously known to visit Singapore in small numbers. The first local record was a flock of 6 individuals seen in the Jurong River area in November and December 1967. In the 1980s, Garganeys were reported almost every year at various coastal areas, but sightings fizzled out in the 1990s. There were sightings of a large flock of 26 individuals at Marina South in March 1992, a pair was spotted at Tuas in November and December 1994, another pair was recorded at Lorong Halus in January 1996, and a trio was seen at Tanah Merah in November 1999. The last verified local record was a single individual at Tanah Merah in November 2001.Eurasian Wigeon – an immature female was seen at Sungei Buloh from December 1986 to February 1987. Another female was found at Kranji Marshes in December 2018.Gadwall – an immature female was seen in Punggol in January 1989.Northern Pintail – There are 5 records for Singapore: a male seen in the Jurong River from December 1967 to January 1968, a bird shot in 1970 (exact location unknown), a small flock at Poyan Reservoir in November 1983, a trio at Sungei Sembawang in November and December 1992, and a single bird seen at Sungei Buloh in February 2016.Eurasian Teal – a single bird was seen on the Jurong River in October 1978, along with a flock of Garganeys.Tufted Duck – A female was seen at Tanah Merah in December 1989."
"Introduced and Escaped WaterfowlLike peafowl, pheasants, and other gamebirds, waterfowl are very popular as pets. Various species of ducks, geese, and swans have become established in areas outside of their native range. So far, apart from the Wandering Whistling Duck, none of the other species recorded here as escapees or other free-living birds have established breeding populations.Mute Swan – native to temperate Europe and Asia, a resident pair lives at the Swan Lake in the Botanic Gardens.Black Swan – a native of Australia, a pair lives at the Eco-Lake in the Botanic Gardens.Wood Duck – A native of North America, a single male was seen at the Eco-Lake in the Botanic Gardens in 2003.Mandarin Duck – Native to temperate East Asia, a single male was seen at the Eco-Lake in the Botanic Gardens in 2005.Radjah Shelduck – This species hails from Australia, New Guinea, and some of the islands of eastern Indonesia. It was first sighted at the Eco-Lake in the Botanic Gardens in 2002, with at least a pair present, and seen until 2007; I could not find any more information about the species being present beyond that.Domestic Duck – Domestic ducks have been seen in various locations like Lower Peirce Reservoir and Marina Barrage, although they usually don’t seem to linger for very long, possibly due to predators.Most domestic ducks are descended from the Mallard, although wild Mallards have not been recorded in Singapore. Another species of duck, the Muscovy Duck of Central and South America, has also been domesticated, and given rise to a few domestic varieties. I haven’t heard of any Muscovy Ducks being seen in the wild in Singapore, although they are on some farms and are also kept as pets."
U sure know ur duck stuff
"Just wondering, is it legal to rear ducks? I dont really see them wandering around as much as chickens."
"Yes, they're technically allowed to be kept as pets in private residential properties. Ducks can be noisy and poop a lot. Poultry (including ducks and chickens) are not allowed in HDB flats."
Yes.Ours stays on the bathroom keeping it clean.you guess it .... yup Toilet Duck :)
"Just curious. Are ducks in Singapore known to be nocturnal? I've personally heard ducks quacking at night and according to the Grandmother stories, ducks quacking at night means that a pontianak is nearby."
"Yes, in fact that seems to be a common complaint among people who rear ducks at home. They will quack, and often even cause a commotion in the entire flock if disturbed at night."
I've never seen a wild duck in singapore
Easiest places to find them are the lakes and ponds at Botanic Gardens and Gardens by the Bay.
Ooh i'll keep a lookout if i go there!
What's new?
Damn that screen to hell! I hate it so much
"There was once an Android error message appeared on the screen, smack in the middle. I know this new panel is meant to be better but sometimes I wish they just stuck with the old one. Or at least improve the bloody design on this one. So many design flaws. There was a Medium article detailing them but too lazy to find it; worth a read (to see how shitty it is from a design POV)"

Thanks!!
"My fiance and I visited Singapore recently and it was absolutely wonderful. Here she is at her favorite restaurant, Jin Jin Eating House - the two of us went there several times. We're both young professionals and did entertain serious thoughts of moving to Singapore mainly because we met so many awesome and nice people there; the diversity of your beautiful city reminds me of my own home city of Toronto. The food, people, culture and history of your great city is absolutely wonderful. My fiance will actually be revisiting next month, I am more than jealous.I think it's hard to experience the ""real"" city on a first visit - but here are the places we went to as tourists:Marine Bay Sands (Our hotel)Gardens by the BayArtScience MuseumSuntec City MallBugis Junction MallMomma Kong'sJin Jin Eating HouseSankai Japanese RestaurantTing Yuan HotpotJi De Chi DessertsOld Airport Road Food CentreMaxwell Food CentreUniversal Studios"
Glad you liked our country! There's absolutely much more good food to be tried. See you soon!P.s What dish is that? I've never seen it before.
It looks like mala Xiang Guo but with soup instead of dry
ya mala tangnot 100% singaporean but a good representation of how different cultures meld and are localised here
Which food would you say was 100% Singaporean?
Mama Kong's and Ji De Chi? And depends on what they ate at Old Airport and Maxwell.
I meant which dishes really
I’ve no idea what it is but I think it looks like army stew
I think it's hotpot...but instead of cooking it yourself the restaurant does it for you 🙂
Eh I haven't even visited half of the places you listed and I have lived here for decades.
to be fair some are tourist traps or artsy-fartsy instagram places.Like why would a typical 30+ YO office drone go to ArtSci Museum on his rare weekends haha.
Tbf they do have interesting exhibits. One on Richard Feynman right now.
"Oh yeah, saw the posters on a bus. Looks fantastic."
"To most of us, we will just ask who?"
On dates loh. ArtSci is awesome for dates.
"yeah you've barely scratched the surface of Sg my fellow Sixer...my folks was there in the 70s and I remembered us being stn'd there during most of the 80's. Jin jin isn't what it was back then, now it caters to foreign palates.Maxwell is pretty good and always had good food. I am sure you also went to check out the rest of the sites like Botanical Garden and Santosa. Love to see some scenic shots!Welcome back to the Six, how you like the cold?"
"I enjoy the cold myself - makes it very easy to sleep. My fiance does not like the cold. It's actually 'warm' today at 8 degrees. I assume you live in Singapore? My current boss use to be a director at a financial institution in Singapore, she has told me alot of great stories of working and living there."
"Loved living in Singapore, I am SG/HK background and miss Singapore daily. The food, the smells, the language and the culture. Did you guys also visit Chinatown and Orchard Park? The prices unfortunately are pretty similar to Queen Street West, downtown here.How was the flight back? As bad as I remember?"
"Yep, the 20+ hour flight from SIN to YYZ is still grueling. A good flight crew definitely helps. Occasionally I've had bad flight crews for North American domestic flights, but pretty much all of my international flights to Asia have had great crews. My fiance and I splurged last year and we flew twice with SIA business and we were absolutely blown away - best flight experience I ever had by a country mile."
"My fiance and I splurged last year and we flew twice with SIA business and we were absolutely blown away - best flight experience I ever had by a country mile.When you get a good crew, I think the experience rivals even first class on many other airlines especially if you're on a non-red-eye flight."
Even the smell of a crowded bus/train on an ultra-humid weekday and all the secondary kids have just gotten out of school?
"when you then live in toronto and it's 35 with humidity making it feel like 43, you'll sit on a crowded bus with secondary school kids going why'd I come all this way :)yes, even that. mostly I miss the blend of high-tech with trees with ah-ma, ah-por doing tai chi at the local pavillion"
This is such a wholesome post - I’m a Singaporean living overseas and definitely miss it.
Is that a Mala hotpot?You guys are a brave bunch.
"If you stayed at MBS where's the obligatory photo of you in the infinity pool on the 65th floor?Also, did you use the MRT to get around?"
Everything is so close walk can Liao.
"You went through standard touristic trail made for posh white people. No wonder it reminds you of Toronto. Definitely not the Singapore I know. I don't want to be a snob and I'm not pretending I know the most iconic Singapore spots, but I would suggest to try small foodcorts of HDB for local food. Go inside the blocks at old Changi or even Holland village. Try coffee from plastic bag and laksa at Katong. Visit National meseum of Singapore to get more insight into how it become what it is now."
"you write very well, consider starting a travel blog :)"
Thank you very much! I shared this post with my fiance and she likes your post - but instead of my own travel blog she wants me to write a travel blog for her!
thats.. thats basically the same thing...
Haha yes it pretty much is with the way I explained it. I meant my fiance wants me to ghost write for her blog.
ohhh haha. yes do that! support her!
unrelated comment coming through *it's u omg haha love your articles and talks
err whut hi
Just paying homage to someone I look up to as a newbie js dev haha
☺️ jia you
Everything is great except for the unbreable heat all year round:(
"That's why I can never stay more than a month at a time, I'm just meant to live in a cool environment. I'm never going to get used to the heat/humidity one-two punch of SG."
"Toronto!? That's cold 60% of the year.As locals, you'll also find the new Sports Hubs at Tampines and Bedok incredible!"
Thank you for enjoying your trip down to Singapore. Glad that you liked our food here. Hope you'll come back again!
You’re visiting one of the hottest month I’ve ever experienced of my life here. Even the locals look like they’re about to jump into a pool fully clothed if given the oppurtunity. How’d you find the weather?
"Hahahahahahah I'm the exact opposite of y'all, I'm planning on moving to Canada"
"Come! You'll love the diversity. What cities are you looking into? Toronto has the majority of its population identifying as non-European. I believe the largest ethnic groups here are Chinese, followed by English then Indian."
For real? I thought there would be more Caucasians in Canada. That's great though seeing as I'm Chinese.
A fun fact I heard recently: most of the Chinese in toronto migrated there bcuz hk was returning to China back in the 90s!
"Canada as whole is majority European - but in many cities like Vancouver and Toronto, Europeans are the minority. In some of the Toronto suburbs the different ethnic groups get really pronounced:Brampton (pop. 600k) 44% South Asian, 26% European, 13% black, 4% FilipinoRichmond Hill (pop. 200k and highest per capita income in Canada) 30% Chinese, 11% Iranian, 10% Italian, 7% Canadian, 3% English"
I just wanted to move somewhere where it wasn't hot as hell everyday and Canada seemed to fit the bill. I'm lucky there are more Asians in Vancouver then since that's where I was looking into
"East Asians make up more than 30% of Vancouver's population, so you'll definitely get a sense of comfort."
"I'm British-born Chinese and when I was working in Vancouver in the early 2000s, everyone kept assuming that I was Canadian... until I opened my mouth! Other than San Francisco, I had never seen so many overseas Chinese in one place before."
It's so bizarre reading about strangers talking how having less of your people is great and rejoicing.
"I am sorry, I can see how it can appear that way. I am trying to celebrate the diversity of Toronto and Vancouver; I love that there's a good mix of cultures and not completely dominated by one culture or race, and that multiculturalism is embraced. My family is a mix of European, black, Indian and Asian and I am proud of that."
"This is a similar phenomenon to Australia - Sydney and Melbourne specifically.i.e. originally ""belonging"" to a native population, then the Caucasians came, and now the country is known as a ""Caucasian country"", but due to recent waves of significant migration, the large cities are now just melting pots of a huge range of cultures.Personally, I haven't been to Vancouver/Toronto to compare, but I've heard it's similar."
Mala?
That's not even a Singaporean dish. OP has been short-changed. We owe him an apology.
Mala is quickly becoming a co-opted national dish just like Japanese ramen.
People Who Call Mala As A Local Dish Should Be Arrested And Thrown In Jail
People Who Type With Each Word Capitalised Should Be Arrested And Thrown In Jail

"Come back soon! Check out our wildlife parks next time, and also Tiong Bahru Market Food Centre!"
r/UpvotedBecauseGirl
Yup no way this gets the same number of upvotes if it was an Asian dude
"Hey there, glad you enjoyed your visit! I have an uncle in Oakville and I stayed at his place before I went to the US to study... I have to say I miss Canada, its winters and its culture so much (especially the poutine and Mickey's Deep Dish Pizzas, both of which I can never get here). You Canadians are some of the nicest people I've ever met, and Canada remains the only place in the world where I miss the people and the places I visited equally, instead of just the latter.There are a few eating and sightseeing places still to be seen that you both missed out on. If you like, make another post or continue this thread, and I, and other local Redditors will be glad to send some suggested places your way. :)"
Where's OP from?
"Canada I assume, he mentioned Toronto. (unless I failed my geography)"
Come back soon! There're a lot more delicious food waiting for you!
it's always nice to visit a country as a tourist.but please don't add onto our population permanentlyWe're already 6 million in a 42km wide island

"Will the names appear in the new constituencies planned for the next GE, or will it still be the old constituencies from 2015?"
Zaobao accidentally reported it as electors for PE.
"This is what saddens me. Lots of good hawker food stalls are permanently lost after a hawker centre goes through a renovation. Good hawker stall food made the traditional way are fast dying. The majority of these stall owners are very old in their 70s, and have no one to take over their business."
"Good hawker stall food made the traditional way are fast dying. The majority of these stall owners are very old in their 70s, and have no one to take over their businessCause rent is too expensive and/or people are not willing to pay for hawker food"
"This is the most infuriating thing. Some people willing to pay alot for Koi, Starbucks, Gongcha, etc. But when ask to pay 30cents more for a hawker kopi they kpkb. How the hawker survive like that?"
Pretty much. I frequent a prawn mee stall at marine parade hawker for over 25 years.I dont think they even care about money. Sometimes the stall only opens 2 days a week. So going there for my fix is hit/miss.The centre underwent renov + some mrt related thing and i dont know where they are now or if they quit.
High rent. No successors. Unable to hire helper to look after stall. Plus stricter government regulation.
no income for 3 months is really rough! would've thought that some form of financial compensation should be provided.
"This means there was an underlying reason to quit in the first place, all they need is a little push, like renovation work to pack it up for good."
Nice article that i can't read.
This is a premium article 🙄
"The unintentional effect of hawker centre renovations: Hawkers quit for goodSINGAPORE - Six days a week, from 6am to 9pm, hawker Lick Su, 74, is on his feet preparing and serving bowls of Teochew fish soup and porridge at Chin Chau Lou stall in Chinatown Complex food centre in Smith Street.But when the food centre, Singapore's largest, closes on Friday (March 1) for a three-month renovation, he will hang up his apron for good.""I'm too old to spend such long hours at this stall. I'm 99 per cent sure I won't come back when the centre reopens,"" said Mr Lick, whose culinary experience goes back to the 1970s.The renovation of hawker centres is done every five to seven years. As these centres undergo a physical makeover, stallholders often use the months-long downtime to mull over their future in the business.It is not uncommon for some to call it quits, resulting in the renovated centre having a new mix of food and stallholders.At Chinatown Complex, for instance, stallholder Francesca Ung, 38, is looking at relocating her Penang Chiak Ho Liao stall. Set up last year, it offers the Penang version of popular food such as nasi lemak, rojak and mee goreng.Though her business breaks even most months, she feels it ought to be better: ""Tourists and young people who are more willing to try our flavours don't know about this hawker centre because it's not visible from the street. Though the renovations are necessary, I don't think it will improve footfall to our stall.""Ms Francesca Ung and her business partner Darrel Krishnan at their Penang Chiak Ho Liao stall. ST PHOTO: SAHIBA CHAWDHARYAt Block 84 Marine Parade Central, the hawker centre and market have already seen a couple of departures, with the completion of renovations delayed by three months.One of them is Katong (Jago) Teochew Mee Pok Kway Teow Mee stall, which has relocated to a coffee shop in Block 80 Marine Parade Central. ""The renovation would take too long to finish, and I needed a regular income,"" said owner Chang Lau Meng, 62, who moved to Block 80 last year.Closed in March last year for the makeover, the centre's initial completion date was this month. But it has been extended to May.A National Environment Agency (NEA) spokesman attributes the delay to ""unforeseen underground services affecting the progress of sanitary and drainage works"", as well as other renovation works. Underground services may include electrical, gas, water and telecom cables.At Chinatown Complex, which is about 35 years old, two of the newer stalls packed up and left even before the place was closed for renovations.Western food stall Silly's Western, which opened in June 2017, shut its doors at the end of last month while Japanese-Italian fusion stall Sutachi did so on Jan 19, just about a year after its opening in December 2017.Sutachi's co-owner Gay Yu Ting, 32, said the stall was confronted with such problems as the rising cost of ingredients and the stagnant growth in customers.""Three months without any income will be tough on us and (the renovation) really prompted us to think about the business more thoroughly,"" she said.Some of the major works at Chinatown Complex include replacing the waste pipes, servicing and repairing the exhaust and fire protection systems, and upgrading the public toilets, said Jalan Besar Town Council.Meanwhile, the Marine Parade centre is undergoing tiling and roofing works as well as getting new sewer and water pipes plus improved drainage, among other things, said the NEA.Hawkers and stallholders at both centres do not pay rent during the renovation period, ST understands. But they also do not get any financial compensation and no temporary food centres are set up for them to make a living.The NEA said the repairs and redecoration works will not lead to higher rents.Still, the delay is frustrating for a 55-year-old Marine Parade stallholder, who wanted to be identified only as Mr Zheng.The father of three, whose children are aged between 19 and 26, has been doing various part-time sales jobs at places such as pasar malams and flower stalls since the centre closed.""There was more work during the Chinese New Year period but now, it's not so easy to find jobs. It's difficult to live day-to-day like this without any financial security,"" said Mr Zheng, who ran a ban mian, or Chinese noodle, stall at the Marine Parade centre for the past 15 years.But Mr Lim Lee Chye, who sits on the committee of the Marine Parade Central market and runs a household goods store at the market, is sanguine about the delay.""It's better to fix any issues now than to have problems crop up later,"" said the 73-year-old, who gets by on his savings."
"Penang Chiak Ho LiaoWonder where they are moving, hopefully within the same centre. Can highly recommend! And too bad Sutachi closing, had really nice food to go with the beer from Smith Street Taps."
"Hmm, I never eat that before but... Guess I have to wait till after Chinatown renovate finish and see if it is still there."
"Found their Facebook page, they seem to be open until Thursday. Doesn't seem like they have found a new spot yet."
"like this ar, i try to go there on wednesday dinner to give it a try lor."

I know that feel...My favorite prawn mee from Toa Payoh Hawker Centre (now is HDB and bus interchange) and bbq stingray from Upper Serangoon Hawker Centre (now is condo).Both hawkers quit because of the renovations/shutdownSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
These effects mostly already considered la in the impact assessment. It’s one of the more obvious effects.
"Considered, but unintended."
On a macro level a couple of shops close down really can’t be helped. In the past they used to have temp arrangement but businesses still affected and close.
"I guess it has to be tried to see the effect.And there are still quite a new centres, so loosing one is no biggie :)"
"Good that they are using this opportunity to quit. Running a hawker stall is tough and backbreaking work. At such old age, they should be able to retire and rest instead of working tirelessly to feed selfish youths and tourists who just want to try traditional food."

I think computational thinking/logical reasoning are more important than coding classes or programming classes.
"this this this!everyone can code, what's more important is how you differentiate yourself from others. coding is just a tool, analytical and problem solving skills will be what sets you apart."
"Yeah, I just started self teaching myself coding and its basically pretty much problem solving (which i suck ass at)"
Sounds like scratchProbably scratch
"It is expected that children between four and five years old would meet some developmental milestones, such as the ability to recognise a few letters in the alphabet or follow short instructions.But at just four years old, Melissa Wong is already able to write basic programs. At a coding class for pre-schoolers at LCCL Coding Academy last Tuesday, she came up with 14 codes comprising seven commands each, in 40 minutes.Each code she wrote allowed her animated character - a fox - to move towards a desired target, like a doughnut or a pet animal, on the iPad.Anxious parents are enrolling pre-schoolers in coding classes, in the hope that the children will learn to grasp logical concepts better and gain an edge over others in school and in life.Dr T. Chandroo, an adviser to the Association of Early Childhood and Training Services, a non-profit organisation run by and for private pre-school and teacher-training operators in Singapore, said coding is basic literacy in the digital age.He added: ""It is never too early to introduce coding to young children because even children who cannot read or spell can grasp the logic of coding through symbols.""Coding was added to the national curriculum in England in 2014, where it is expected to be taught to children from the age of five.NEVER TOO EARLYIt is never too early to introduce coding to young children because even children who cannot read or spell can grasp the logic of coding through symbols.DR T. CHANDROO, an adviser to the Association of Early Childhood and Training Services, a non-profit organisation run by and for private pre-school and teacher-training operators in Singapore.TEACHING CONCEPTSFor children aged six and below, it is only realistic to teach computational thinking concepts instead of the actual programming or coding tool that is too complex for five-to six-year-olds to grasp.MR STEVEN YOON, director of Jules Corporation. Computational thinking involves concepts like recognising patterns or solving problems in a sequential manner. Operators of coding schools say coding is a subset of computational thinking.It is also embraced in the United States and countries in the European Union.But there are detractors.Mr Andreas Schleicher said coding will be as irrelevant as trigonometry one day.The director of education and skills at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development instead argues that more focus should be placed on teaching children tools that will benefit them in the future, such as data science or computational thinking.Computational thinking involves concepts like recognising patterns or solving problems in a sequential manner.""You teach it to three-year-olds and by the time they graduate they will ask you, 'Remind me, what was coding?' That tool will be outdated very soon,"" Mr Schleicher told The Straits Times.Operators of coding schools say they are actually teaching the pre-schoolers computational thinking, of which coding is a subset.""For children aged six and below, it is only realistic to teach computational thinking concepts instead of the actual programming or coding tool that is too complex for five-to six-year-olds to grasp,"" said Mr Steven Yoon, director of Jules Corporation.His company has run computational thinking classes for more than 3,000 pre-schoolers in childcare centres and community agencies here over the last two years since it first started in 2017.Operators say the children are not being made to learn advanced programming skills or languages such as Python, which is generally the domain of adults who do data analysis.Ms Candice Wang, co-founder of Coding Lab, which runs pre-school coding classes as well as free public workshops in partnership with the National Library Board, said her coding school does not take in children below the age of four.""As they get more independent when they turn four, and are able to understand the concepts of sequencing and giving clear instructions, this is the age that is suitable for them to learn the concepts of coding,"" she added.Founder of LCCL Coding Academy Juliana Ung said since the children are not strictly learning the technical aspects of certain programming languages, the skills that they pick up will not become obsolete.While she declined to give exact figures, she said enrolment of four-and five-year-olds increased by five-fold last year compared with the year before. It started offering such classes in 2017.First Code Academy saw a 10 per cent growth in enrolment for children aged four to five last year compared with the year before.At coding school Saturday Kids, which offers classes only to children aged five and above, the pupils learn to guide a robot to complete a task through commands.They also use the iPad to create animations and pick up concepts like parallel thinking, which involves multiple lines of code with each carrying out its own functions simultaneously.In teaching Melissa, Ms Ung guided the young girl on how to break problems down into smaller parts and refused to give her quick or easy solutions even when she struggled.To cut screen time, several of the coding schools conduct some of the lessons offline."
"At Jules, only 15 minutes in a typical one-hour class would involve the pre-schoolers playing ""coding"" games through mobile apps. At First Code Academy, a screenless coding interface - a wooden robot - is used instead.Lessons can range from $250 for 40 lessons to several thousands for longer courses or workshops.North East Community Development Council offers free coding classes for 1,200 Primary 3 to 5 children from low-income families to get them ""future-ready"".Said its spokesman: ""We believe in equal opportunities for everyone regardless of their household situations.""We want to level up the skills of children from underprivileged families so that they are on an equal playing field with their peers.""Mr Malcolm Wong, 41, first sent his daughter Melissa and her brother, now six, for coding classes last year because he wanted them to pick up logical reasoning skills.""It is a basic survival skill,"" said Mr Wong, director of a matchmaking agency.""I don't have aspirations for them to be artificial-intelligence programmers... If they have to be glued to their screens, this is the best reason for it instead of just watching YouTube videos in a non-interactive way."""
"Back then I asked for coding lessons at age 8; was told by the enrichment centre itself that I was too young for it. Okay lah to be fair I obviously couldn't understand everything but through coding I learnt reasoning and logic which I am very grateful for.I think it's good to let kids have a taster. But if it becomes like 'piano lesson No. 2' where parents (who can afford it) force their kids to do something they don't like, then I really don't see a point. The goal is not for your kids to be the next Steve Jobs or create some multi-million $ app. It's for them to understand the beauty of coding and how to think about things. Ultimately the code changes from program to program (or even across languages) but the thinking process is what really matters.Till this day I'm thankful my parents decided to let me have the lessons despite the centre's advice. Edit: although I have a feeling if I ended up not liking it, they would've gone 'see lah tell you liao now you waste money' 😅😅"

"The 3 ministerial portfolios he held are those perennially whacked by common folks: healthcare, housing, and transport."
"Guess so. I figured the $8 comments were referencing the heart bypass thing, but it seemed like a minor thing compared to the hate he got (he broke his arm after all, seems weird to be bashing him in an article about it).I always thought people just mainly saw him as Henry Thia's doppelganger lol. Didn't realise folks hated him that much."

The headlines are the chamomile tea to the comment section's subsequent IBS-induced diarrhea.
Iirc he's made quite a few statements in the past that showed how out of touch he was with the population.And the 8 dollar heart bypass meme will always be around
Did he pay 8 dollars for his medical fees again?

"It could be emissions from Jurong Island, which is Singapore's petrochemical hub. Jurong island refines 1.5 million barrels of oil a day, and contributes some S$81 billion to Singapore's manufacturing output [1], making Singapore the 3rd largest exporter of refined oil in 2017 [2] [3]. On a side note, it's kind of why NUS/NTU Chemical Engineering program is quite competitive. ChemE's 10th percentile was AAA/B back in 2012 [4], although it has decayed since.Some particular combination of sea breeze & prevailing wind could means that the 'pollution' output disperses more at night.I used to notice this regularly at night while I was at NUS."
srly another post about this?
I’m enjoying how he needs a moment on the floor to understand how he started the physical aspect of the fight and some how didn’t get to partake in it.
The bike guy has a white beard so the hit was even more impressive to me.
And it was a left!
"Nobody sees an opening left hook comingSigned, a lefty (who almost never hits people)"
This should be near the top of your resumeu/SoSomething• Dedicated worker•volunteers at local homeless shelter on Sundays•Almost never hits people• Has car
"That wasn’t a hook. It was straight down the pipe. I’m a left handed boxer and we have a term called “southpaw advantage.” Not too many people are used to getting a left straight down the middle.Also props to the old man for not hesitating. No shoving or yelling, just handled his business."
It's probably the reason lefties haven't died off entirely. Genetically you guys don't live as long as right-handed people but being someone who wins fights is a good evolutionary reason for your genes to stick around.
Come here and say that to our face.
Get a left straight down the pipe!
You only gotta live long enough to fuck
"There is this fencing champion (of course I forgot the name) that says that is indeed easier hitting someone from the left as we righties aren't used to it at all; he, living in a right-world, has his brain trained to defend on both sides. So yeah. Impressive."
"I really appreciate the way he took the time to lay his bike down on the grass first, too."
"Handedness is so strange. It's definitely true though. In lots of situations, being a lefty surprises folks. And sometimes just the surprise is a big advantage."
Lefty’s unite!!
Southpaw detected.
UNIIITTEEE!
"I saw a video years ago where Chuck Norris stated that 90% of the time the first punch thrown is a right. Since then I've only thrown lefts to start, and win a fight. I've never lost. Goddamn, I am so tough."
"Same. I don't lose either, but that's because I cant lose if I don't fight to begin with."
Tbf if you aren't fighting you are already winning against everyone who is. :)
There are indeed lots of words that start from the left side of the keyboard...
Cause they drive on the left
"The driver is on the right side of the vehicle also, so the footage may have been flipped, depending on what country it was filmed in."
"He looks in top shape, probably better than most young guns even."

Old man strength is not to be fucked with.
Old man strength is a real thing. I once saw my dad do [impressive strength feat] at age 55.

Your mom?
Bike dude has some pipes! I like that he just hit him once as self defence. The driver did try to run him over.
"When I first read your comment I thought it said ""white board"" so I went back and rewatched it until I eventually realized and was disappointed."
Old man strength.
Why?
'Curb your enthusiasm' theme plays
Talk about having no control in a fight. Bike guy takes a few steps back to put his 3k bike in the grass.
Couldn’t have said it better.
Underrated comment
I don't think he was expecting a left hook.
"He was charging with some kind of weapon, what do you think he is expecting? A hug?"
nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!!
Our chief weapon is surprise
"Surprise and fear, our two weapons."
"“You button hooked me, I didn’t know you were gonna button hook me.”"
I dont think he expected anything. Hard to hit someone or defend yourself with hands hanging by your side.
Don't know what you're talking about. I find leading with my face is very good at protecting my hands from being injured.

People in cars act surprised when they realise cyclists are fitter than them.
"Those clips on bottom of the shoes have very little traction on pavement. Not the best for maneuverability! (look style pedals, not sure about the other kinds)."
On grass you’d be fine. Itd almost be like a single big cleat. On pavement though. Might as well be a bundle of bananas
That's what makes the punch even more impressive.
Some newer cleats are wider and have much better stability when walking.
They certainly dont do MMA in those cleats
"Egg Beaters/other MTB type pedals maybe ok, but anything with a large plastic cleat not good."
Shimano metal cleats would give excellent traction on dirt and concrete pavement.
Can confirm. The biggest disadvantage is the inflexible nature of the shoe as a whole.
Tell that to the Transporter
"And when you cycle on public roads you're constantly waiting for this type of situation. You deal with so many people who actively want to do you harm, you're mentally prepared for someone to get out of their car and try to fight you."

"I had a ""friend"" in college who wore tights to ride his new mommy-bought bicycle. He rode it to class in full tights. He was not fit in any way."

This is in Singapore I didn't read the article but my dad (who is an avid cyclist) told me that the cyclist also threw his bottle at the truck. Might be a different story though

Let me pick up on that fit guy... r/instant_regret
Why did he run up to him and then hesitate. What did he think would happen in this situation? Lol
That's Singapore.

That was so good to watch. Best part is that the driver can't do shit about it because he's on camera trying to run the guy over with a fucking work truck.
That was more like a slap...and he went right down...
"Bought myself a sunlight desk lamp shipped from the US. Silly me did not consider the fact they use different plugs. From what I gather, the lamp uses the USA Polarized NEMA 1-15P 2 Pin - 10 Amp, even with an adapter it does not seem to work. The bulb lights for 1-2 seconds and fades out. The bulb isn't dead as far as I can tell since it lights up again when I turn it off and on, but it fades away the same.Anyone familiar with sockets/plugs please give me some advice. m(_ _)mEdit: Apparently the voltage and frequency don't match. Though none of the step down transformers I found say anything about frequency... >_>"
Might be the different voltage...in the US they use 120voltts while we use 240volts
"Not very good at electric stuff, but does it say how many volts it is running on? Electronic usually runs on both 220 and 110, but who knows"
"It's not just different plugs. More importantly it's different voltage, which can kill the appliance. You can use a transformer."
"Crap. I didn't think it used different voltage too. You are right, they use 120v 60hz, Singapore uses 240v 50hz. I hope I didn't damage the lamp. Will hunt for transformer. Thanks!"
"Speech and word recognition converted to text would be much earlier detection of aggression. And there are only a few choice Hokkein, Malay and Tamil words that are commonplace before each confrontation. These exchange of swear words might take a while before punches are thrown so early intervention is possible."
You first sentence sure got me expecting an academic answer
"Hi tech but prisoners living condition at least, is still pretty claustrophobic and old. Like, straw mats and no pillows in 2019... at the very least have a pillow for them to better rest themselves.Oh and KBW's surgery is probably going to be cheaper than the cost of a pillow, if we ignore his insurance premium right there."
Somewhat relatedI like their idea of focusing more on repairing people.
"It would take about at least a decade to get Singapore politicians to be empathetic to their cause. I hope that at least they can push for slight QOL improvements for prisoners, but of course not to the extend of giving them too much comfort. Just the basic needs (can sleep adequately well, etc)"
"inb4 people saying wah prison so nice, they live better than NSFs."
"Next milestone for Risk Assessment and Horizon Scanning program (RAHS, pronounced ""roz"")"
So they're really going forward with the facial recognition cameras on lampposts. I don't like this at all.
Uh this bridge is always like that everyday leh.
Did you know that the bridge lights up like this all year round?
"correct me if Im wrong, what bout that parkour dude lighting on the bridge"
"Oh, I just spotted it in this pic. Yeah that seems like an installation"
If you've been to ilight in the past few years you'd have been disappointed at this year's.This year everything has to be Bicentennial themed and a lot of the installations are on bridges and far away from each other.Past few years there were much more interesting exhibits.
Yeah there weren’t much “photo-worthy” exhibits either. I walked through 20+ displays and didn’t bother with the last 10 because there’s just SO MUCH WALKING. Maybe they just secretly want Singaporeans to lose some weight.
I was mainly there for the piano at fort canning. Was my first iLight.But yea was underwhelming
"Yea, it was kind of disappointing. Nothing really interesting."

Screw this pay gap shit. It doesn't exist.
"The pay gap definitely exists, but it’s not a scam / system problem / “male pentarchy” / whatever nonsense SJWs come up with.Just a reminder that Uber, an automated platform, run solely by pricing algorithms, with no care about what gender is the driver/passenger, has a pay gap of 7%, which is also the average gender pay gap rate.http://fortune.com/2018/02/06/uber-gender-pay-gap-study/The reasons given were that men drive faster, so they can complete more trips, and they work longer hours."
"I should be more specific in stating no pay gap for people of the same skill, experience, background and attitude."
"i am a hiring manager and i can tell u, there isn't one pay system for males and another for females. at least not in the last 5 companies i worked for. everyone follows the exact same pay system."
that's because you have unconsious bias. you don't see the evidence right in front of you. i can list 100 studies which show that women are better and are underpaid. the future is female
/s?
it's sad that we now have to label sarcasm.
Well online there will be people who take your words at face value
"As long as there are labels, people will find a way to discriminate. It's unfortunate but that's reality. Even appearance is something people subconsciously or consciously use to discriminate.So what do we do? Form groups and fight for each individual group's rights. Women started theirs many years ago, men on the other hand have been sitting on their balls doing nothing for themselves because they think they are already in a comfortable position in society.We should all fight for our rights. Feminism is women fighting for theirs.Just remember that there will always be extreme examples that go rogue, just like any religion. For example, I can call myself a feminist but go around championing women's rights at the COST of men's rights, that'll be toxic and not what Feminism champions, which is the equality of sexes. So can a terrorist call himself a religious prophet, but we all know he's just an attention seeking sob.TLDR: Don't complain about other groups fighting for their rights, start fighting for your own."
This is an unnecessarily divisive article that will only turn more people away from feminism. Which is a shame because I've always thought AWARE to be brighter than their western counterparts

Any recourse to this? Any idea where the heck is this from?
I’ve turned on my air conditioning and air purifier to literally no avail. Most likely it’s from the usual suspects of Malaysia or Indonesia.What I do is I just spray deodorant or air freshener when I’m heading to bed.
Weird... I have mine on as well and it seems to be working
Yeah I just have a very sensitive nose to be honest. I already smelled the haze? Earlier on Thursday
OP! its either the JB landfill fire or the gas chemical company there

"As an RM of a bank, I think it's very unlikely. Banks have a strict non-disclosure if personal information. Even though it's a good deed, I don't think it's likely that they will declare someone's personal hand phone number out to a third party.You might want to try giving it to the police, and ask them to find out the owners number and contact them."
Definitely not. Breach of banking secrecy. You're better off dropping everything at your nearest police post
No. They’ll not reveal the phone or any contact/name details. Check if they can contact the person directly.

"Don't encourage them to equate ""Greater China"" to China"
"If this is true, then are Malaysia, Vancouver, San Francisco and Havana all part of Greater China also, since there's a significant number of ethnic Chinese there?With this logic, Australia is also Greater Britain."
Have you been to Melbourne? It's definitely part of Greater China as well

"Many Malaysian chinese people themselves can live their entire lives in their chinese bubble only though, explaining the abysmal BM/English some of them have. I don’t think it’s a major problem to live in Malaysia with mandarin only as long as you only stick to the chinese community, which is entirely doable in the urban areas."
"Its not about living in malaysia. China has to insert china chinese into malaysia, but the policy of naturalizing the residents require them to come into contact with muslims, which in china is detained and killed. It'll lead to extra civil outroar if they realize muslims are normal people"

Greater Great Britain
"To be fair, Australia and even Canada are technically under the monarchy of the UK, which would make Australia under ""Greater Britain"".To me, ""Greater China"" would be those areas that were ruled over by the PRC or ROC, namely China, Macau, HK, and Taiwan. Singapore is a stretch though, unless we're counting it because it has a large number of Chinese people. But under that definition, half of Penang could be included as well."
"By this logic, eventually many various cities will be part of ""Greater China""."
"As a minority, I feel really uncomfortable about this. I think we grew to form our own culture no? What’s this nonsense about Singapore being a Chinese cultured country? Its as if the past hundred years of living together doesn’t mean anything. Its like Bon Jovi or Daughtrt naming their own band after themselves."
Even being of chinese descent in the majority I feel uncomfortable as well. Once our ancestors stepped foot on this sunny island our culture inevitably mixed and veered off in a different direction.
yea man I'm a dialect minority because my dialect is mandarin like who tf dialect mandarin
"Mandarin was never the language of Singaporeans until LKY decided to implement it. I dislike MOE branding Mandarin education as a “mother tongue” “preservation of Chinese cultural identity”, since strictly speaking it’s not our mother tongue at all.I find the terminology to be a little misleading as well. The government has us believe that the overarching important Chinese language = Mandarin and that other things like Hokkien or Cantonese are dialects of Chinese. The reality is that they are all different enough, completely mutually unintelligible even, and can be considered as separate languages.As someone who studies linguistics as a hobby people often say “a language is a dialect with a navy and an army”. The reason that Hokkien isn’t considered a language is because none of the governments of places where it’s spoken consider it as such, except Taiwan where they call it “Taiwanese”. Likewise for Cantonese, even HK’s official language is “Chinese”, being ambiguous on the spoken variety.!"
"LOL, 2nd language is purely an economic move, no need to pretend it had some sort of cultural meaning, that's just the nicer way to sell it."
Same guy that dismantled the Chinese-education schools and stripped those diplomas and degrees of legal worth. All about political expediency for him.
"Spot. On.I read linguistics in uni, and the most well-known professor in the department started every lecture (reportedly in his entire career) with the assertion/observation thatA language is the definition of a specific culture, at a specific place, at a specific time. Change the culture, the place, or the time, and the language must change. When the language changes, that is definitive proof that at least one of the others has as well.Emphasis in the original. This feeds into the distinction between ""mixing bowl"" and ""salad bowl"" multiculturalism: do your constituent cultures fuse together to become a total greater than the sum of their parts, or is a tomato a tomato no matter how vigorously you toss it and the lettuce together? The answer to that here has always been do what the Leeader says. What happens when (not if) there's a national crisis that forces us mere mediocres to come together and work together to save the country, like the Pioneer Generation in their day? If we're all ""safely"" ensconced in our own linguistic/cultural bubbles with only designated interactions between each other, will we be able to? Will enough of us even recognise the need to? After 40 years, I have my doubts.Majulah!"
language is a symbiotic parasite. the english language is responsible for destroying cultural identity in some countries. words can kill.
really?*looks at grandma watching Ch8 filled with China actors*looks at sibling listening to chinese pop music*looks back at Greater China definitionseems legit
"My observation as foreigner, most SG culture, especially in the more normal working class areas, is very Chinese. There is almost no discernible difference. The food is the same, the people are similarly rude, there are the same KTV and escort girls and crowds of people for no reason. In the most cosmopolitan central parts SG culture is far from being Chinese. The people are much more refined, polite, the food is better and fresher and the attitude more global."
"One interesting thing is that western sociologists sometimes lump Singapore PAP with the likes of CCP with regards to their common ideology of governanceAnother interesting this is that Singaporean culture is relatively young and easily molded due to its youth, with little to none heritage ties. This was also the result of LKYs policies, which IMO were necessary but leaves the country open to cultural manipulation, thus the need for ""total defence""For example, explain Singaporean culture.Malaysian culture, due to the size of the country and the age of the country itself (every state has different food, culture, and religious practices) since it didn't redefine itself, retained its ""roots"" so to speak, and thus China, among other reasons has not entered culturally.Not to mention that the chinese in SEA were originally part of the resistance of CCP, and this was preserved in Malaysian Chinese education while Singapore did not preserve this."
Lets just take Malaysian culture then.
"I think it's more about celebrating, preserving and building upon the roots of Singapore culture."
Should also include every Chinatown in every country /s
Chinatown in Malaysia has barely any chinese lmao
"Right now it's PRC citizens who are spouting this crap, but decades ago there were many sympathizers among Singapore citizens too. That's why we have to be this ethnocentric and talk about race all the time in our schools and politics. No matter how much you emphasize that this is a multi-racial, multi-cultural, and multi-lingual society, there will always be a small group of morons who think Singapore is a 'Chinese country'."
There still are some Singaporeans who think we owe some consideration to China thanks to our roots. Unfortunately.
"AKA my grandmother. Talk about ying sui si yuan, needa go back china home town etc. Then I asked her who do you know there exactly? Then shes like no.. but gotta know your roots. Like hallo, since my great gramp’s dad set foot in SG, the family has never looked back at China okay? I’m Singaporean, my family is Singaporean, my children will be Singaporeans. I gave 2 years and soon another 10 for this country. No political rhetoric can change that."
Just remind them that Southern chinese were part of the resistance
Especially the older generation who were Chinese educated and being left behind.... 😢
"Especially the older generation who were Chinese educated and being left behind.... 😢They were just as ""left behind"" as those who were Tamil educated or Malay educated, yet you don't see them making the same amount of noise."
"I’d like to think it’s mostly older generation, but I very much doubt it is. There’re plenty of China-leaning Singaporeans in their 30s to 40s who will breed the next generation of China-leaning Singaporeans."
"Don’t forget PRC immigrants gaining PR with their Singaporean children as well, who will almost unilaterally be pro-China."
"Do PR children automatically get citizenship? To my knowledge, they're still considered PR right? Being considered a citizen of a country as long as you're born on their soil is just a thing in the US iirc"
"Jus soli, as birthright citizenship is called is followed in a lot of countries other than the U.S. - nearly the entirety of South and North America. Then there are countries with restricted jus soli."
"My bad, I meant former PRCs who’re now citizens."
"To be fair, a number of PRC immigrants are actually fairly anti-China, and move here to escape the more oppressive policies of the PRC."
Plus a fair number of PRC are employed by MOE to conduct classes in Chinese.
You do know that the older gen are being taught stuff that was destroyed during the cultural revolution in china right? Iirv Most SEA chinese in fact originated from part of the chinese resistance that fled to taiwan.But you don't because you didnt understand what being Chinese educated meant.
I am Singaporean and I find this offensive.
It is very insulting.
What? No! Just because Chinese lived on this island and form the majority does not mean singapore is any part China.FYI I’m chinese and I don’t like the way China is trying to inch into all the lands.

"I personally think there's nothing wrong with trying to classify countries with similar cultures.For example, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, The UK and The USA are classified under the ""Anglophone Countries"" due to the similar language - that being English - shared between them.I think the problem lies within the choice of the name. If you want to classify cultures, you can't use a country's name, in this case China. Since the name ""China"" is associated with a country, not a culture, you can't use it to group Chinese majority countries, SG, HK, Macau, Taiwan and China. Not to mention, using the word ""Greater"" implies conquest. Just think, ""Greater East-Asia Co-prosperity Sphere"" or ""Greater Germany"". It's just not in good taste.Instead a better name would've been ""Sinophone Countries"" a fun little spinoff I made from ""Anglophone Countries""."
There’s already a name: the Chinese diaspora.
"Nah, a ""diaspora"" means the people of that ethnic group is spread out across different parts of the world, away from their place of origin. This disqualifies Chinese people"
Why?
"Because Chinese people originate from, well, China and as far as I know, China is still populated by Chinese.To qualify as a culture in diaspora, they have to be spread in small groups across multiple areas and be a minority in their place of origin."
I'm not sure about being a minority in the place of origin. People talk about the African Diaspora for example.
"I could be referring to a more stricter definition of diaspora. But I mentioned in another comment, to each their own. That's the problem with these kind of naming conventions"
"Oxford dictionariesMerriam-Webster dictionaryCambridge DictionaryCollins DictionaryDoesn’t seem to support your definition, but hey, I guess it could be a field-specific definition. Like how ponding is technically a geography-specific definition."
"Possibly. I could be referring to a more stricter definition of diaspora. If you loosen the definition, then yeah, Chinese Diaspora makes sense.Problem comes that nowadays, almost every single population of ethnic people have at least one or more groups living in other regions, thanks to our increasingly globised world. So does that make every culture a diaspora? Which is why I opt for the stricter definition. But to each their own, I guess"
"Well, problem is that the Chinese in Singapore are more aglophone than sinophone"
"Its just the Sinosphere concept but more rigidly defined.In fact, one can also postulate an 'Outer Sinosphere' including Korea, Japan, Vietnam and Mongolia based on ethnic n cultural commonalities. K-pop n J-pop, as well as movement of celebrities across this common space, serve as evidence.By comparison, the concept of the Anglosphere has been well known for a long time now."

I have never heard of anyone ever including SG inside greater China
"Well, some (an ethno-nationalistic vocal minority, I’m not implying all or even most) of Singaporeans/PRCs I’ve heard basically consider us as some sort of offshoot of China. Thus forth comes the need for loyalty towards the motherland (by siding with PRC politically), complete fluency in mandarin (because Singapore doesn’t have Malays and Indians right?) among other things.They won’t explicitly say that we’re part of greater China, but they sure hope we were."
i literally can’t think of anybody that i know of that wants Singapore to be part of greater China
so 1 in 200 humans are part of Greater Mongolia as well?
I normally saw term 'Greater China' in MNC as a business group. i believe this term is used on for buiness purposes.
The 2 has been at it for years.Ngee Ann is the richer one as compared to the other one
Why set up 2 different clans and have them reside in the same building when their purpose is to help the same community?

"Hi gentlemen, just confirmed my vocation as an admin Clerk so just 9-5 job. I'm looking to take the ACCA qualification tests as I wanna be doing more than just admin work in the army. Can some ex-NSFs who took ACCA during their time in the army provide me with some advice, also would this give me an edge while looking for jobs/ university admission?Side note: Just got back my A-level results , looking to enter NTU accountancyEdit: Other than ACCA, I'm also interested in translation courses, any good places to study part-time translation?"
You finish ACCA don't need to uni liao. Straight go to working world.
Congrats! You successfully picked up the encik language!
*gennermen
"ACCA is not that useful now tbh. If i am not wrong, it is no longer a route to becoming a chartered accountant in Singapore. Or at least it has been suspended until ISCA/ACCA agree on a deal. Google “pathways to become chartered accountant ISCA” for details.If your a level grades are already good enough to enter the uni program, there is not much point taking ACCA. Also, go talk to people on accounting careers. It is not exactly that rosy well paying job the older generation always talk about."
part time degree while ns would be more viable like what i did
U spelt it wrongly. It's gennerman. Go sign 3 extras.
"I'd say try to make the most of your time upgrading yourself if you can. These applies to courses (like the ACCA you mentioned) and skills. Some managed to get their driving/riding license during NSF.I'm not saying you can't relax when you book out during weekday, but if you think about it: 5 days a week, you could do a lot with those nights."
"Learn excel and vba, more useful and versatile for accountants ( or office job for that matter)"
"Not a translation course, but you might want to take a look at r/translator. There are a lot of daily requests across multiple languages & subject matter, and you might want to try your hand at some of those requests. Translators there range from the casual to the professional."
Hello!Just wondering if anyone went through this route recently and is 100% subsidised?Polyclinic consultation > NUH referral > NUH walk-in > X-Ray > ExtractRather than going through SAFTI Dental > NUH referral > NUH walk-in > X-Ray > ExtractThanks in advance!
"That's what I did. you have to pay for the polyclinic consultation first though, and claim on nsportal after that"
Wait I thought polyclinic consultation is covered under 11B also? Or dental different?
dental not covered
Icic when did you get yours done?Is the referral to NUH long?(iirc NUH is walk-in if you got referral letter right)I called SAFTI they fully booked until April lmao have to go this route
"last year. no, you can walk in to NUH after lunch hours to get your xray done"
Alright thanks for your replies!
"You can walk in NUH as soon as you get the referral letter from polyclinic. After NUH do the xray and determine your wisdom tooth, you have to book an extraction date, which can be days, weeks, or months depending on your luck and whether anyone cancelled/rescheduled their appointment."
Alright thanks a lot!
"Strange. I didn't have to pay for my polyclinic consultation though. I just went in and told the doctor straight that my wisdom tooth was giving me a toothache (I lied), and that I'll need a referral letter for NUH to get it extracted.He just poked around a bit inside before issuing the letter, and when making payment they asked if I was under 11B and waved me away when I said yes."
that is if it's a normal GP. mine was a dental consultation
Ah I see. Thanks for explaining then.
Got referral from in camp dental centre
Takes too long(will ORD before my surgery gets scheduled) that's why I'm seeking this route
Pretty sure they book using the same methods. I just walked into my in camp dental and got the surgery within 3 weeks
I mean to even see the SAFTI Dental I need wait till April haha
"Yup, I went through the first route which you've listed and it's fully subsidised."
Alright thanks!To even see the SAFTI Dental I need wait till April lmao By then too late le
"I went polyclinic > referral to NDC >xray + consultation at NDC > extraction at NDC. 100% subsidised. And no I didn't have to claim any shit from nsportal. I just didn't have to pay.On a side note though if your wisdom teeth are completely straight, functional and healthy it might not be 100% subsidised."
Safti don't want to refer me. Going the polyclinic dental - > referral to hospital route now
Why SAFTI don't want refer you sia?
"Went polyclinic first, got a referral to KTPH for X-Ray, then extraction also done at KTPH.Everything subsidized except for the consultation at polyclinic.Told us to claim via nsportal but till now, I haven receive the amount. (Extraction was done back in Apr 2018 and I ORD in Aug 2018)"

"So, I was just wondering what if like i helped a friend by taking her in for a few months to help her out because she got kicked out. I was wondering if her parents come looking for her, are there anything that i need to look out for. There is no concrete proof that her parents are kicking her out just that she said that her mum said she didn't want to raise her anymore and can leave if she wants.EDIT: Nvm my mum said no (:"
It depends on whether are you a male or female...
hmm do you any ways she can get like a cheaper rental place? like are there any schemes or anything
How old are the both of you?

Nvm my mum just said no 🙃
"Hahaha then yeah, that's the biggest issue."

"17 is a bit tricky as she's not considered an adult, legally. I think. Also, at 17, ppl tend to take things a bit too seriously so it might be a bit blown out of proportion. Also, is she going to stay in your room? Might be troublesome if the parents make noise about inappropriate behaviour, specially if you guys are of different gender."

"So is avarice, but with things like the Prosperity Gospel and the Kong Hee case, one might think the old 7 deadly sins are not applicable now."

"You give some to the church for future wealth. Basically investment in a religious setting, but unlike actual investment where there are stats to review, you can only ""have faith"" that you get returns."
"Tan said that KCC Ventures eventually told him in a follow-up call that the reason for the cancellation was that the building management was “insistent that political activities aren’t allowed in the premises”.According to the venue rental agreement that was seen by Mothership, the only clause involving cancellation on the venue’s side stated that a full refund would be provided in the event of “unforeseen circumstances”.Wouldn't they know this when the SDP booked the venue? Did they realize the SDP was a political party at the eleventh hour?"
"Probably important to make a distinction between the KCC management and the building management. The building management probably only found out closer to the event that it was SDP and forced KCC to cancel. Building management is the one who said political activities not allowed, not KCC"
It was unforeseen that the venue management was incompetent.

"that is fair criticism. Criticism is perfectly fine, shutting it down altogether is different"
"The authoritarian character worships the past. What has been, will eternally be. To wish or to work for something that has not yet been before is crime or madness. The miracle of creation—and creation is always a miracle—is outside of his range of emotional experience.We should remember the past, but not be captive to it. Worse still is to condemn others to an alternate reality where nobody ever learns or changes or grows. I'm not so much a fan of CSJ as I was a few years ago, but if his name and that of LHL were on my ballot, I wouldn't spoil my vote. And I wouldn't vote for someone who has proven to be more interested in milking real and imagined past glories than in building a future."
"Rather ironic to use this quote in context of a church, or any dogmatic religion for that matter."
Side/unrelated question but since we are talking about churches: do the business arms of churches have to pay taxes?
"Yes they do. They're registered as ""Charitable companies"" IIRC, and for all intents and purposes, they are treated as any other company."
"Thank you! I googled “charitable companies in Singapore” and found this FAQ:Are charities liable to pay income tax on income derived from their activities as approved for the purpose of the Charities Act? Are business subsidiaries liable to pay income tax on their trading profits?The income of all charities registered under the Charities Act is exempt from income tax. However, business subsidiaries that are set up by charities are treated in the same manner as any other company. The income of these business subsidiaries is subject to income tax.In case anyone else is wondering the same too! Thanks u/falseagent!"
I am a JC graudate who is going to apply for uni soon. I have a lot of interest in Medicine but my results will not allow me to study medicine is Sg. I am thinking of going into Biomedical Engineering. However I am getting advice that the job opportunities for Biomed is not very good is Sg.
"I graduated from EEE, NTU almost 13 years ago. I also did my college (junior college or JC) in Singapore. There are so many medical companies that a biomed degree can help you get in. I would recommend you to research on your own and absolutely not give in to folks who are saying to you that biomed opportunities are not there in Singapore.I would absolutely NOT give up on my dreams without my own efforts at one hundred per cent.I also recommend you to talk to engineers and scientists in the biomed industry, visit career fairs that are held in NTU and NUS.So here's your checklist :Google if there are career fairs to be held in either NTU, OR NUStalk to biomed engineersSearch for bio med engineers in LinkedIn, and try to message them or look into their profile to get some ideas on where the opportunies are.Even if you can't message folks on LinkedIn, you could try leaving a question in one of the appropriate forums.These are the top biomed companies here and I am sure they have a site in Singapore as well:Astar in NTU Abbott lab Pfizer Boston scientific Baxter Medtronic Arkray FreseniusGood luck!"
Thank you. I will research more about it.
I am getting advice that the job opportunities for Biomed is not very good is Sg.Yes.
"If your passion for med doesn’t fade after a few years, can always try grad med (Duke-NUS). Longer route to becoming a dr but could be worth it"

"Try allied health courses at SIT (radiography, radiation therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy). Still medical field, biomedical science in a way. Easier to get in."

"My friend graduated last year June from NUS Biomedical engineering. According to her, it's not easy to find a Biomedical engineering job in Singapore. She tried applying to biomedical engineering positions in hospitals, but they were looking for people with at least 2 years of experience. As for the biomed companies in Singapore, they are rarely hiring biomedical engineers (probably because not specialized enough). As of recently, they are looking for people who are have degrees in Chemistry, Chemical engineering, Mechanical engineering and Material science engineering.NUS biomedical engineering is a lot more engineering-inclined as compared to NTU Bioengineering. You will learn stuff like Hemodynamic, some programming languages here and there, and more specialized stuff like optometry in MRI"
"Don't bother with biomed. Prospects are just shitty. I have a first class honors in biomedical sciences (different, I know) and was cohort valedictorian and I couldn't land a decent degree level job anywhere related to the field. Those with Bmed engineering don't fare better either. It's just not specialist enough and not in sufficient demand. Ended up applying to graduate med school and secured a place, and spent the free time from my graduation to the start of med school working a manufacturing job instead. It was hard work and had absolutely nothing to do with my degree, but remuneration was very, very handsome for a blue collar job. Paid more at entry than some of my degree level friends.If you wish to land a graduate entry spot in medicine, you can actually study pretty much anything at the undergrad level; it doesn't have to be biomed. Studying biomed won't necessarily lay much groundwork for med school because the focus of the content is often significantly different, not to mention that there's a shit load more to study in the latter. A lot of med school aspirants end up in biomed or something similar because they think it gives them an advantage. It isn't the case, and my current med cohort is highly varied - there's some dude who studied music and another who has a PhD in chemical engineering. Music dude isn't having a harder time than me, or anyone who has a degree vaguely related to medical science.Studying whatever you like and want. Don't get hung up on something biomed and its piss-poor job prospects. In case you don't get into grad med school, at least you won't be stuck with shitty career prospects."

"The level of civic mindedness in Asian societies is far above the west. That’s why I always find it funny when Singaporeans who have never lived or worked overseas claim that Singaporeans are selfish or bad mannered. Compared to aussies, Americans and Europeans, Singaporeans are polite saints. Americans are by far the worst they have this entitled attitude where they litter, don’t pick up their dog shit, and chuck their homeless on the streets along with heroin needles. Not every neighbourhood of course."
India and China would like to have a word with you.
Ironically my personal experience is China is better than certain parts of the USA. Esp those slummy areas and SF and LA and NY.
Comparing all of China to the worst parts of the USA and using that comparison as basis for claiming China has a higher level of civic mindedness than the west is a weak argument.
I didn’t say whole of china though. I only mentioned a personal anecdote no conclusion. I know Reddit is fervently anti China lol. Generally I’ve visited mostly tier one or two cities. These are close to sg in terms of civic mindedness.But of course to sg redditors China prcs are worse than wild dogs I suppose.
"This is a question for those of you who have collected the keys to your BTO flats: what is the bare minimum you can get away with in terms of renovations?I'm thinking of buying a BTO flat for investment purposes, but as I will not be living in it during the 5 year Minimum Occupation Period, I'm not really in a rush to kit it out. For instance, I'm fine with not having built-in storage space and simply buying cupboards separately. I am also fine with not installing air conditioning units as I rarely turn on the AC.However, it seems to me that you absolutely need to renovate the flat if you want the bare necessities such as a stove or toilet. Or am I wrong?Edit: Wow, really appreciate the serious responses here. Some of you mentioned that if you don't renovate you won't have lighting, flooring or a stove.Maybe I should rephrase my question: what's the bare minimum that would make your flat habitable but super basic? I would probably get some basic, cheap furniture for the flat. I am usually not in Singapore but would be able to use the flat periodically when back, so I would need it to be functional. At the same time, I don't want to spend any more than I have to on renovations."
"My grandma collected the keys to her BTO a few years back and there were no kitchen cabinets / stove supplied. It didn't even have the flooring done so she had to put in basic reno before it could become livable.If I'm not wrong you're not allowed to leave your unit vacant. On paper as per the MOP rules you're required to LIVE IN your flat. If nobody complains it's all cool, but if your neighbours complain then HDB is gonna come talk to you. I remember there was some guy on HWZ that left his flat vacant for a long period to stay with his kids at his in-laws place as it was closer to his workplace and he received a warning letter from the HDB. (Probably someone complained about the vacant flat). Tried to find the link but I couldn't."
"Dk is jealous or what. Vacant also complain. If its rented out to others then neighbour complain, i nothing to say."
Flooring can opt in.
"Yikes, if the flat comes with no flooring it's definitely not habitable.By the way do all BTOs come without built-in stoves? And what about kitchen sinks? Could probably get away with using a portable stove but am not sure what to do if there's no sink."
"You can opt in for flooring and basic toilet fixtures (sink and shower mixer). But you will probably need someone to do up kitchen cabinets for you, and to settle electricity and plumbing (i.e. lights and water heater). Also air-con if you're planning to install that.You will need to get your own kitchen sink and kitchen hob as well. Or you could just wash your stuff in the bathroom sink I guess.I don't think two room flats come with interior doors. But it will have a main fire door, of course.Source: Just renovated my BTO"
"Thanks, that was super helpful."
"last year when i was in the market for newly MOP HDB, i found a unit totally unfurnished and not renovated at all. i can even see electrical cable dangling on the top of the ceiling. i believe the owner just change the legal address, but never touch step into the unit."
"If you're not living in it, don't do anything at all. Just let it be how it is, and avoid costly issues like mold in your furnishings when you do eventually decide to move in (or sell). Resale value of any furnishings after the MOP will be near zero.By the way, if you don't live in the flat, will the MOP ever end? The wording makes it sound like it will go on indefinitely until you actually occupy the flat."
Put legal address there and live somewhere else. Most people rent out all rooms except one so they legally live there while they physically stay elsewhere.
I'm aware of that scam. But OP didn't ask about renting the place out.
I think the only thing I can afford is a 2 room flat. Which means I can forget about renting out one room.
Make sure your tenants don't piss of your neighbors if not they will complain to hdb then you good game
"Thanks, and good point. A future buyer might want to re-renovate the whole thing, which would make furnishings redundant."
You will need lights since the bto doesn't come with lights. The rest is really soft furnishings if you want to be minimalist
It is but make sure you regularly visit the apartment and perform basic cleaning and check if there's any problems.
"Thanks, good point, would probably be a good idea to stay there a few weeks after collecting the keys to check for defects."
I think the kitchen cabinet is a must. Water heater and lightings. Not sure if your bto includes doors and floor tiles too.
"You could assemble some IKEA shelves instead of installing kitchen cabinets, I think. And thanks, didn't think about the water heater. I would not be pleased to receive a flat without a door...."
"It depends on the BTO opt-in options. It differs from BTO to BTO - you'll only be able to clarify this I think at the point of purchase. But you'll need to ""top up"" for these options.Some come with opt-in flooring - without that option, you'll get a rough cement foundation that's not fit for walking on. There's no water heater either, and if I remember correctly there won't be any lights at all. Just wires dangling down from the ceiling. There are no stoves at all - the kitchen area will look as empty as the living room. You might need to convert or create additional electrical points too - this will mean hiring an electrician to re-route some cables. I didn't have enough powerpoint outlets and I needed an additional spot for a booster.The kitchen and the flooring will most likely be the most expensive items in your renovation. That will most likely cost around $10k?Also depends if fully furnished toilets are part of the BTO opt-ins. Most likely they will be - if not, you'll need to get someone to do your showerhead, basin and taps. Again, you'll need to pay extra for this opt-in.Be a bit careful with leaving your BTO unoccupied. If you're working overseas and this is just a home to drop by, that's fine. But if you have another local address, you risk getting caught by the authorities and having your flat confiscated. In my BTO area, the neighbours talk among themselves which flat has no one living in it... and I wouldn't put it past a nosey parker to call in the authorities since they have called them in for smaller transgressions :("
That was very helpful. And thanks for the warning... The gossipy neighbours sound scary!
My neighbour hasn’t lived in his flat since bto four years ago. Always found it a huge waste in terms of op cost.
"Just moved into my flat after renovating. IMO absolute minimum to be liveable would be (going by rooms):Entire flat - flooring, lighting, fans, and curtains/blinds.Kitchen - Countertop(s), cupboards/shelving and stove if you intend to cook at all.Service yard - Washing machine.Bathrooms - At least 1 water heater, shower heads, and shower screen.Living room and bedrooms - Whatever your comfort level is as they come completely bare.You may also want to engage someone (or DIY) to convert your telephone jacks to data points as the only data point that comes stock is in the living room."
Wow thanks for this checklist!
"Make sure to get it wired for fibre broadband, cable and even aircon because installing the trunking system is much easier to do during renovation and much more a pain (more expensive) to add after."
"Thanks, definitely did not know that."
"Are you buying as a single or family ?Single can only buy 2 room BTO, investment purpose wise, not sure what kind of gains are you looking for ??- As a single if you get 2 room, you will not be able to rent out your unit so you will be locked in for 5 years. 5 years of 6 digit cash locked in, town council + annual income tax, with 2.6% mortgage interest rolling, you will suffer a 5 digit loss minimally.- If buying as a family, your family will get locked in and suffer the 5 years MOP together with you, at the same time, the people mentioned must stay there, and you can only do room rentals, and you must add in simple reno cost like 20k ? with simple furnishing ? 30-40k?Capital gain wise, unless you get a BTO in non-matured estates with grants, you won't gain much $ when you sell, given the way the market is turning out right now."
"Not sure if I'm going ahead with it. I'm not 35 yet and, even when I do turn 35 unless the tikam gods are smiling down on me it'll probably be some time before I manage to successfully ballot for a flat. Just weighing up the pros and cons from an investment perspective. I'm a pretty conservative investor, so I thought it would be nice to add to my portfolio a small property I could rent out after the MOP is over and perhaps sell at a higher price a decade or two down the road.The thing is, I have some CPF funds but they're a pittance and will not amount to anything when it's retirement payout time (am self-employed and have opted to invest my savings for retirement rather than deposit them into my CPF account). Since these CPF funds are more or less useless for retirement purposes, I'd like to spend what little there is on a small 2-room BTO rather than let them languish in the account. Not thinking of 3-room or bigger because the idea is just to put my CPF funds to work. With some luck (and of course the singles grant) I should be able to pay for most of the flat in cash without having to take out a loan, hence mortgage interest should hopefully not be an issue.I'm aware that I won't be able to rent out the flat. But since I'm applying as a single nobody else would be obliged to live there with me. I spend a lot of my time in a city with a lower cost of living than Singapore's, so it would still be cheaper to stay where I am than to live in the BTO full-time. Whenever I visit Singapore I could still use the BTO though, and am fine with using it as my official address.Care to share your opinion on this from an investment point of view?"
"I was thinking of two pairs of two letter prefixes, with the first prefix still retaining its first letter as ‘S’ or possible ‘E’, and use the second prefix to get the last letter in the car plateOnce we’re done with the current three letter S prefix at SYZ 9999 B, we could start at “SA AA 1 E”, last to SA AA 9999 S”, and move on to SA AB 1 A” and so on and so forth, all the way to “SY ZZ 9999 P”, with approximately 13824 combinations of prefixes, but it’s gonna be slightly less because of certain “restricted prefixes such as “PA” for buses, “RD” for autonomous cars and “QX” for police vehicles.What do you guys think?"
Use emojis obviouslySY🙄
Or replace the S with it lol
Queensland drivers set to get emoji number plates
"Use E prefix, just like the 80s but with 3 letters instead e.g. EAAWith a fixed car population, it might take a little longer to exhaust the existing S-series, giving us a longer time to continue the LLL NNNN L format"
Takes around 2.5 years for 1 set of plates to be complete eg from SLA to SMA...so around 30 years from now
maybe by then license plates become qr code already
"Possible but thinking that it should also be human recognisable. Just imagine, you're a witness of a hit-and-run."
your eye got built in qr code reader too
Built by Tai Yong Medical
Black Mirror
Scan the QR code on the license plate to get the driver’s full name and NRIC
"satellite tracked iu readers already a thinglikely in 30 years, all your movement on roads are already able to be tracked, cam footage auto uploaded to lta. heck don't even know how many % of cars are human driven."
"Maybe by then all automated car, no need license plate"
of course like our IC it become T!
"Of course we don't get enough drive-in visitors from Terengganu to confuse anybody at all with that…and nobody from Singapore ever drives up that far.Oh, hang on..."
Another thing is that the ‘T’ series is already kind of used by trailers.
Good point. It's been a long day...
"what's the math of which year then cars will hit SY prefixi think to make it less complicated, can just start with T like the 2000+ nric"
"If there are really going to be no new COE’s, wouldn’t they just star recycling some of the old plates that are available?"
You have the wrong understanding. Zero COE growth does not mean no new COE being issued.
Like that the government won’t be able to make money on people keeping old license plates.
"That would render the old series’ valueless.My family has a car plate in the SDA series, and if they use a scrapped car plate in the SDA series, the one we own would be completely worthless"
"i think a generic plate from the 90s would be worth no more than 2-3k, going up only for those with more auspicious numbers"
"The LTA has marked each prefix on their PDF file to denote age. Recycling them would not only be impossible, but devalue plates with the same prefix if it were to happen"
"i'm referring to old number prices on the 'second hand' market. i have a sbr plate, was told it could probably go for around 2-3k. actually all these old car plate sales nothing to do with lta anyway other than transfer fee, so it's not like lta cares about how high an old collectible/auspicious plate fetches"
"From my perspective, he may be talking about plates that were never registered from day 1. For example, my family retained our vitara’s plate when we upgraded, so the new SLM series plate we were gonna get was just scrapped then and there.If he does mean recycling those “unused” plates, that wouldn’t be possible because of the age identifier thing"
HDB after 99 years also no value. as if they care that your meaningless car plate got no value either.
"In the LTA’s case, they’re using the prefix to denote when the vehicle was registered. Recycling old/unused ones would completely skew this system.Imagine buying a car with this algorithm after SYZ ends, and getting a car plate starting with an old prefix like SBM or SCF. LTA denotes that those were registered back in the 80s-90s, but the vehicle was “registered” way after that, in 2040~ after the SYZ series."
"But you can already register a new car with an old license plate, so why would recycling a license plates change anything?"
"That’s assuming you kept the plate from the day it was registered, by keeping it registered to some vehicle. My family has a car plate which is 6666 and is one in the E series, and we’ve kept it since 1972.From the Mercedes it was bought with, it was kept for a long time being transferred from car to car until the early 2000’s where it was registered to a Corolla and now, an Audi. So to speak, the VRN was kept on a vehicle, because that’s how you hold onto the number. You can’t just randomly re register old numbers as and when you like.If you look up some plates with “not so significant numbers” like SFL6268X”, you’ll find that they don’t exist or were never registered to begin with.If we exhausted the SYZ series and the LTA randomly reinstated an old unused/scrapped plate in the SF-, SG- or even the E or Single S series, it would completely skew the age identifier system and devalue those which share the same prefix"
"I'm not understanding your point.You can already re-register multiple vehicles to the same license plate with no issue today.Why would reusing old license plates cause an issue when there's presently no issue?Are you even sure that LTA uses the prefix to determine the year of registration, or are you just assuming? Because I can't see how it can be used when you can just re-register a brand new 2019 car with an old SFL carplate."
As I said. That’s only IF you kept the plate through the years on a car. Not scrapping it and having it reinstated by the LTA
Why not T for Temasek?

thanks
We forgot to thank Indonesia for clean air...
"Nah, now got to thank Malaysia."
Jurong West got fire on Sunday early morning
i see
Bukit panjang also have.
Is anyone doing anything about this? Me no like the smell. :(
thanks for sharing my post OP
"So that explains the glowing ""beacon"" light in the North East."
yup or it can be a jurong fire except that is probably way too far
More likely local pollution.

"Long story short, I [20F] called the police on my older brother [21M] over a case of domestic abuse. The case was written as criminal intimidation and he was arrested today, around 4 PM. I eventually chose not to pursue the matter because of extreme pressure from my parents not to even though I felt that calling the police was the right thing (I suffered from verbal and physical abuse from him for almost six years).At the police station, the policeman taking down my statement said that because my brother threatened to commit suicide, they have to take him to IMH and check his mental well-being. As such, he is still with the police right now but I don’t know when he will be back or if he will be punished (since I chose to drop the matter).My parents say that he will be charged now (I don’t know where they got this information as they have not made contact with the police) and I don’t know what that means. Will he be jailed? What happens now? How do I find out more information about my brother?My relationship with him is almost nonexistent but my parents are blaming me for calling the police, and I know they would likely disown or be mad at me forever if my brother does jail time. This isn’t the first time my brother has abused me but I was extremely afraid this time because his threats have gotten more extreme (he threatened to kill all of my siblings and I before committing suicide, even after he has hit me a lot of times).Please help by giving me more information on such cases or methods of finding more information. Thank you.UPDATE (24 / 02): As of this morning, my parents went to bail him out and he's back home again and like, I was forced to apologise to him for calling the cops and he promised to stop with the abuse. I don't know if he will because this isn't the first time we had a ""family meeting"" but my parents just wanted to get over this issue.I didn't expect this post to get this much attention and I'm thankful for all the advice given. I'm also sorry I don't have a happy ending to tell you guys because as much as I want to see my brother get punished, I can't bring myself to pursue the matter at the expense of hurting my family (I have an elderly grandmother who dotes on my brother a lot; she was utterly heartbroken when the police took him away yesterday). The only course of action I'm taking right now (which many of you may not agree to) is to just ignore him and try to be at home as little as possible. Yes, this is not a long term solution but I'm desperately saving money and one day, be financially independent enough to leave my parents' home."
"Fuck that. You did nothing wrong by calling the police. The blame should be on your parents, not you. Had they done their job of being good parents and protecting you, you wouldn't have had to resort to going to the police.Know that you did NOTHING wrong. Your brother fucked up. Your parents fucked up. Him landing in jail is a result of his own actions that your parents failed to discipline him. You do not deserve to be the victim and pay the price for this. You should be the one that's disowning them for being such terrible parents rather than the other way around.However I fear that neither your parents or your brother will ever realize this, and I really do not think your brother's brain is capable of comprehending that you were nice to him by dropping charges, but he would instead only remember how you called the police on him and how he should get payback on you now.What is your education, work, and financial situation right now? Are you in university? Can you apply to live in a dorm? Or if you are working then are you earning enough to rent and live by yourself?"
"Hi, I know that I was right to call the police but my parents found it to be a disgrace, like I was shaming the whole family.As of this morning, my parents went to bail him out and he's back home again and like, I was forced to apologise to him for calling the cops and he promised to stop with the abuse. I don't know if he will because this isn't the first time we had a ""family meeting"" but my parents just wanted to get over this issue.I'm currently a year one in NUS but I didn't apply for dorm because it was too expensive (I'm trying to apply for financial aid now). I only have a part time job but I'm far from being financially independent enough to live on my own.I didn't expect this post to get this much attention and I'm thankful for all the advice given. I'm also sorry I don't have a happy ending to tell you guys because as much as I want to see my brother get punished, I can't bring myself to pursue the matter at the expense of hurting my family (I have an elderly grandmother who dotes on my brother a lot; she was utterly heartbroken when the police took him away yesterday). The only course of action I'm taking right now (which many of you may not agree to) is to just ignore him and try to be at home as little as possible. Yes, this is not a long term solution but I'm desperately saving money and one day, be financially independent enough to leave my parents' home."
"Nah, your brother and parents are a disgrace and their behaviour is shameful. Respectively, they've been inflicting and condoning violence against their own family, which is a dishonourable act, and more than enough grounds to disown them. And such dishonourable people have no right to tell you what's shameful or not."
"Reading through your situation, it's fucking awful. I can see why your family does not want to ""split"", but goddamn, something has to be done about your brother, and fucking props to you for being the only one with enough balls to deal with it.However, about hurting your family, telling them about his abuse towards you isn't hurting your family. Telling them that you're scared to be in the house won't hurt them. Telling them that this is an issue that needs to be resolved quickly isn't hurting your family.What is hurting your family is their refusal to acknowledge your issues with your brother. Just reading this, they are too damn protective of him. Especially the point about shaming the family. You're not shaming them for calling the police. They're bringing shame upon themselves for not dealing with this properly. You're doing the right thing.For now, stay away as much as possible. Find a friend to stay over with. No shame in reaching out for help among your friends. Stay safe."
"Just a passerby, but please know that you're doing what you can to survive and there's nothing to be ashamed of. And don't apologize for the lack of happy ending. I'd rather you just be safe and sound because no one should feel this way. Especially from their own family and parents.For now, is it possible to stay at a friend's? And also, if your brother promises to stop the abuse then sure. But yeah, I think only you know whether to be skeptical. Manage your expectations!And stay safe!"
"my parents found it to be a disgrace, like I was shaming the whole familyI think trying to downplay abuse a family member suffered so as not to ""lose face"" is even more disgraceful."
"OP, please also record some of your brothers threats and your parents inaction and wilful ignorance of his actions and words. When you eventually leave home, your parents or your brother may try to track you down and it’s important to file a pre-emptive police report to prevent them from lying and saying you’re misssing etc. when you file that report, having recordings to back up your statements is very important!I’m in an abusive relationship as well and am also saving up to move out asap. PM me if you need to rant or anything like that, i may not reply immediately but i will reply.Please make sure you record your brothers threats etc. it’s very important for purposes of evidence etc.know that you did the right thing and that your family are clearly in the wrong here."
"Everyone here have stated similar points to what I hold from this matter, so I won't be repeating their points again for ya.Threatening murders and suicides as a way for your brother to get to you is a criminal offence. As much as they may be siblings and blood-related, no person should ever lose her personal dignity as a human being from physical and emotional abuse. As long as you are in fear of your own safety and the wellbeing of others around you, follow through your original course of action. These things, if not taken aggressively early on, will have severe repercussions that will definitely hunt you down for the rest of your life.Also, your parents. If your parents ever decide to disown you or cut their support, you can file for a child maintenance order. Under the Women's Charter (CAP. 353), Section 69,(2)  The court may, on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for his child who is unable to maintain himself, order that parent to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the maintenance of that child.You are a university student, who is not financially independent and require support to pursue your studies to prepare you for the working world. Should funding be a serious problem for you if you take this course of action, do consult your own university for bursaries, grants (I don't suggest loans - unless extremely necessary) and any other financial support that will help ease the transition if necessary.All the best for your studies ahead! There are many people in this world who care about you. :)"
Asian families... Again
"For what it's worth, ignoring my bro and mom has worked well for me for more than a decade. There have been only a few rare avoidable attacks since then. For example, when both my parents were overseas and my bro ran out of money, but I refused to lend him. I could have given him the money first and asked my dad to tell my mom to return me the money. But I would rather take the punches than help him.Your situation may improve or worsen significantly now. I wish you all the best. Don't hesitate to get help if you have to. If your family doesn't care about your safety, you don't have to care about their feelings."
"Wow, this comment is fast game. Great comment"
"I just want to say that you dropping the charge now will not improve the situation, but rather your brother will probably take revenge on you upon release.I will be worried about my safety if i am u. I would strongly suggest you to have a talk with your parent, come clean with what he done to you (maybe they have no idea), and question them on what they will do to protect you.You are responsible for your (and your sibling) safety."
"Hi, thank you for replying. I have already dropped the charges but he is still detained at the police station. I just don’t know what’s going to happen next for him.The thing is that my parents are extremely traditional and they are aware of the abuse for years. They always told me to ignore him or blamed me when he hit me because I didn’t ignore him enough so there’s no protection from him. Lately, I tried staying away from home because of school and work but I’m still a student with limited funds so I have to come back home every day. Today was one of those times where he was extremely aggressive towards me and it escalated very quickly.Yes, originally I wasn’t going to call the police but then he made the threat towards my siblings and I realised that I had to do something."
"I have already dropped the charges but he is still detained at the police station.It's not too late. Citizens can't unilaterally press or drop criminal charges anyway, it's the AGC that does it. If I were you I'd go back to the police and press charges.but I was extremely afraid this time because his threats have gotten more extreme (he threatened to kill all of my siblings and I before committing suicide, even after he has hit me a lot of times).You've already burnt your bridges with him by going to the police, or rather, he has by hitting you and threatening you and your family. Might as well follow through, to protect yourself, your siblings, and society from him. As it stands you might be in even greater danger if you don't, now that he knows you're not a powerless victim he can continue to abuse. Please take care of yourself."
"honestly just gtfo of this toxic family as soon as you are able to, your parents are being the accomplices here by telling you to stay silent/blaming you. You do not need any of this toxic shit at all, he will just abuse you even further since your parents are in a way condoning his actions."
"The law is fair, just tell the truth. If you need any help, you can go to any family service center. There will be professionals to help."
"Upvoting this. Please reach out to your neighbourhood Feiyue Family Services, Touch Comm Care or REACH. There are many MSF Family Care Services outreach units around too."
"Hi i am sorry to hear about that.Now things are even worst, because not only are your parent not protective towards you guys, your brother will definitely hate you to the bone for calling the police.I know it is not easy for you to make a decision so big, but please think carefully whether are you going to drop the charges. You should have a talk with him at the police situation to assess the situation.Another advice is to have a talk with your siblings to have a family meeting to discuss the situation. 1 opinion may be nothing, but 2 or more opinion from your siblings may change their perspective.Oh and sorry to be rude but your parent is not traditional. They are cowards who cant differentiate between right and wrong. We are not talking about protecting an outsider over their children, now both the culprit and victims are their children.Please have some rest and think with a clear mind. All the best!"
Out of curiousity how old are your other siblings? Do they get abused as well?
"I would fear for my safety too if I had gone to the police. I'm not sure if this is a good time to talk to OP's parents. Honestly, I would be more afraid of my mom killing me than my bro killing me."
"Dear OP, I can see this has been a stressful situation for you & your family & I am sure this will be traumatizing in one way or another for everyone involved.If this is your first time calling up police, Police will not be heartlessly sending your brother straight to jail but rather the usual procedure from their side is to gather information on what happened on both sides of the story & investigate the case. Part that involves escorting your brother to IMH for psychological assesment, & the outcome will usually be along the lines of a mild warning.(As far as I know for first-time/2nd police reports, if repeated I am unclear) In regards to your parents, understandably they have their reasons to stop you from calling up police (not only because of blood ties but also at times parents do not want things to be blown out of proportion) Use this time to speak to them about your brother & the abusive behaviours he inflicts to hurt you physically & mentally (6+ years of abuse is honestly awful & the scars that you get out of these 6 years won't disappear overnight) Regardless, if there is anything that I can assist or if you are in need of a listening ear, my inbox is open.Please stay strong."
"Once it is a criminal case, AGC decides whether to charge or not.Anyway, whatever it is, your brother needs to be punished and he needs help and I do think calling the cops on him is the start."
"Yup. Once hand to police, its AGC's call. Even if you wanna withdraw at your end, AGC will still run the process to the end."
"OP, is there anyone you can depend on other than your parents in the event the situation gets worse. The reason I say this is your claim that he has threatened to kill all your siblings and then commit suicide. Sadly people who threaten in this manner are likely to follow thru when they next snap.Talk to the Police and say that you want to take out a personal protection for yourself and your siblings. They will direct you to the magistrate court. Google to get the information. Write-off your parents as they clearly cannot control him. In fact their conduct is encouraging the abuse.Do not wait, do it tomorrow if you can. It clearly re-draws the engagement model. The next time he strikes you or your siblings he is in trouble. He will more conscious and realise that the role of the parents are now with the state. The order does not guarantee anything but it raises the barrier considerably."
"Just because he is your brother doesnt mean shit. If he is toxic, then cut him out from your life. If your parents do not care and doesnt have your well being at heart, then they can go fuck themselves. You dont need such people in your life."
"Sorry I'm not sure whether you said your brother is already charged, or not. In any case, the other redditor/s who mentioned this are correct - the police investigations and criminal investigations are out of your hands by now. If however you have some channel to the investigating officer for your case, try to tell them that, if they do charge your brother, it may worsen your situation at home and may even make your situation at home more unstable / less safe. Hopefully the IO will then note this when the decision is made whether to charge your brother.Legally, you can consider making an application for a Protection Order under the Protection From Harassment Act, which is designed to provide legal relief in situations like yours. You will likely need a lawyer to do it for you, and if you cannot afford one, you can try to ask for free Legal representation at the Legal Aid Bureau.But legal options may not be of any real help, especially in repairing or dealing with the relationships with your parents/brother. For that, some redditor suggested PAVE and you can consider going to the nearest Family Service Centre to ask for help. I'm not trained for this kind of issues, but I think you might find someone who knows what is happening at the FSC or at PAVE.Good luck - we hear you on the possible threat to your life/safety here and, if your parents are not going to do anything about it and if you cannot have an adult convo with them about this, then you should try the above."
"Hey I've been in a very similar situation and I got it very badly from my parents when I decided to call the police. You and your siblings can apply for the Personal Protection Order (PPO). Also, it's very common in our culture that you're embarrassing the entire family when you do something like that plus you'll be labelled a heartless douchebag. BUT, please, for the sake of your life and your siblings' lives, know that you're doing the right thing. I consulted professional help before and they told me to cut off contact from my toxic family ASAP and that I was doing the right thing. It took me 16 years to walk out from that toxic life and it has never been a better time of my life. I have finally gotten a chance to live happily and no more in fear and I hope you'll get the opportunity to be liberated as well."
"Your parents are not the first parents around to behave in a criminally negligent manner. They seem to think that bringing up children simply involves providing for basic needs, and then they choose to be impervious to what else is going on. You have suffered too long and too greatly. Given that, there is very little basis for you to feel any moral obligation or filial duties to your parents. You have to break out from the cage you are trapped in. To remain in that cage, especially with what has now happened, will bring you vastly more misery. Tap all the resources that the authorities and social services can provide you to make the needed change."
"Hi OP,Maybe you can go to Family Violence by MSF for more information on what you can do. It seems like your parents does not really want to lose your brother. You can go to a nearby Family Service Centres to seek for professional help and they can advice you on how to deal with it.You can head to the Family Justice Court to apply for Protection Order and Expedited Order by yourself since you are 21 years old and above.It's best you discuss with your parents what options are available and choose a best option from there.

"Are you fucking kidding me???? None of this is your fault, hell, it's your parents' and your brother's fault!Okay, so your parents are blaming you for his arrest? It's not your fault because:He's threatened to murder you: repulsive cuntbasketHe threatened his own suicide: DOUBLE cuntbasketHe abused you even though you're fucking siblings: TRIPLE cuntbasketHe threatened the safety of your other siblings: QUADRUPLE cuntbasketYour parents stood idly by while he did all this for 6 BLOODY YEARS: QUINTUPLE cuntbasketYour parents want to DISOWN you for no valid reason: S-S-SEXTUPLE cuntbasketYour parents didn't rear him well enough that he can be a massive douche: SEPTUPLE cuntbasketYour parents are blaming you for their own fuckups (ie a shitty child): OCTUPLE cuntbasketThat's eight, EIGHT motherfucking cuntbaskets I count. And none of it was your fault. Your brother deserves everything he gets and your parents should burn in hell.(IMO: you shouldn't have dropped charges. Cunts like these never learn kindness. Did you expect he'd recognise your actions as kindness??? Naive. Press charges. Get this cunt as long a prison sentence as possible, spread it on social media to drag his name through the fucking dirt.)"
I think we’re all out of cuntbaskets for today.

Your parents are not protecting you. You need to get out of that house ASAP.
"Hi OP, if you’re dependent on your parents and afraid they’ll disown you with no place to stay, remember that the law (Women’s Charter) states that your parents have to maintain you up till 21, and after 21 if you’re studying. So don’t worry about that! Just make sure you’re safe:) if your parents throw you out, go to your school or the family service centres like the other commenters suggested:) take care!"
You did nothing wrong man. Nobody should put up with physical / verbal abuse even if it’s from your own siblings. Imagine if he did carry out his threats. It’s saddening that your parents are still siding him and are upset at you for calling the police. I hope your brother gets the help he needs if it’s a mental issue.
"Since your update, i guess you've decided to stick to the decision to just endure it out until you can leave them. I think its really brave of you to have come to this.Here are some suggestions to your safety. They may or may not be applicable. do what you feel is best for youPrepare emergency escape route if this shit ever happens again. There are apps that let you call the police/emergency contacts immediately by pressing a button on your phone repeatedly. Plan how you can travel the moment youre out that door, and plan which friends/family house you can go to. Keep an emergency bag in your room with all the necessary itemsTalk to NUS counseller. They might have suggestions on how to make things easier for you, like receiving more financial aid. Telling them about your situation at home, you could really try appealing to the school to live in a dorm because your home is no longer safe for you. Figure out if you could stay for free, or get a loan for it. Don’t be afraid/embarassed in approaching higher up faculty/staff if you need to. (it just feels that your home is such an unsafe and volatile zone, i really wish you could get out,, for your own sanity and happiness. But i know you have your younger siblings to consider..)Focus on getting really good at your studies. if you're the top few in your course, it would be easy finding a job that's stable and pays well. So you can rent a place after school and move out, and work towards settling any loans you mightve taken out to fund your own schoolingReach out to your closest friends. Don’t suffer alone. They would want to help and support you.Do not feel any way guilty for your actions. You made the right call when reaching out to the policeWhen you have time, re-engage with doing the things you love, like your hobbies, or practicing self-love. Taking care/healing your mental wellbeing is important. Reach out to a counseller if you need someone professional to talk to.do those legal PPO stuff other redditors have commentedAll the best. Hope everything gets better"
"He’s been abusing you and your siblings because he can, his parents gave him free roam to do it. But because you called the police, you showed that you’re not to be messed with and it showed you’re smarter and you have power to actually stop him.Your brother’s ego might be hurt (he’s using suicide to scare and control you, ie i don’t care about myself so much i can murder you) so he might try and escalate the abuse. Well checkmate boy cos now if there’s any more abuse, especially physical, you can press the charges and it’ll fit the narrative and secure the conviction all the more.Your parents are enabling him to go to jail (he’ll go to jail anyway in the future for abusing his own wife and kids) so it’s probably an ethical thing for him to go to prison now and know he’s not king of the world, and then come out and turn over a new leaf.take care and remember you’re stronger; you’ve stood up to him and got the police to intervene. all he was capable of is harassment in a household that was enabled by his parents lol"
"The dynamics between you, your siblings with your brother would be different from the dynamics between say, your parents and your brother. This is part of the nature of family violence.Your brother can be abusive towards you but not towards your parents, so you/your siblings may have different experiences with him than your parents would have with him. So kudos on recognising that he's posed harm, and for taking action to protect you and your siblings.It is difficult for parents to acknowledge that their children could be abusive or criminals. That's not to say it's acceptable, just that you and your siblings might be find this journey lonely and you may feel guilty too. But you definitely have the right to feel safe.As you've put up with this for years, it might be you've come to a point where you want to end the violence, or it could be that something changed for the worse, hence you called the police. I am concerned for your safety and your mental wellbeing. Please seek professional help as soon as possible, including for your other siblings. Please contact the services listed below. AWARE is another avenue (http://www.aware.org.sg/womens-care-centre/legal-services/). Ask if there are shelters for you.Can you negotiate with your parents to help you get a dorm, or is the financial situation not good for your parents as well? Does the uni have subsidised assistance?I've found that sending professional descriptions of issues (e.g. depression, family violence) have surprised people (family and friends) and move them to recognising the issues, and actually resulted in action. Consider doing that to educating your parents but be prepared that that everyone is different. They might consider yes this is the situation, but they still don't want him in jail etc. The thing is, he might need mental health support if this stems from a mental health issue. Also, your parents might be stuck in a situation where they think it's either home or jail. Maybe help them understand there could be middle-of-the-ground solutions e.g. you moving to a dorm, getting your bro mental health support.All the best xx"
"If you have to leave your home immediately due to family violence and have no place to go, there are crisis shelters where you can stay temporarily. You may approach a Family Service Centre or the Police if you wish to go to a crisis shelter. You can also seek shelter with relatives or friends you trust.You can apply for a Protection Order or Expedited Order from the Family Justice Courts on your own if you are 21 years old and above. If you are below 21 years old, your relative, guardian or any person responsible for your care or a social worker can apply for a Protection Order on your behalf.You can apply for a Protection Order at:The Family Justice Courts Address: 3 Havelock Square Singapore 059725 Tel: 6435 5077In short, your bro is not mentally sound, you need to protect yourself if you think your family members are yet to understand the gravity of the situation.One more organisation which could essentially help is Break the Silence Against Family Violence CALL COMCARE NOW 1800-222-0000Take care"
"Hello, please take advice here with a pinch of salt, since the authority is involved there’s much complexity to your case.No one here is qualified except the professionals to give you advice or tell you what you should have done or should not do and what to do next.Every family quarrel is unique, and all family quarrel. Seek assistance from professionals or family counselling centers immediately period."
"You did the right thing by calling the police. You had potentially saved the lives of everyone there, including yourself.Your parents are in the wrong - for blaming you, for enabling the years of violence and abuse, and for turning their little emperor into a monster.Since your parents are not rational or thinking, you do not have to listen to them. Go with your instincts for self-preservation.Ask the police about applying for Personal Protection Orders and also for family social services to help you with the next steps. The social workers can also talk some sense into your parents.It will be good for your brother to stay at IMH for a while since he wants to kill everyone and himself.You are strong. You did well. You did right."
"Honestly speaking I would recommend you to get out of that house for your sake asap. Your parents will not help you in any way if he were to be released. Is there anyone that you can depend on at the moment? Friends, relative etc. Assuming you're 18 and above. There are some good advice thats been given in the other comments. Do take it"
"This is so r/raisedbynarcissists. You shouldn't be forced to do anything by your parents, and if you're old enough and financially capable, you should move out. I've learned time and time again that promises mean nothing in families like these, and I've observed this with many friends of mine. Most of whom are now in therapy because their social skills were impeded by their families actions.I think you should value your own mental health and freedom over a family like this."
"Firstly, after getting checked at the IMH, chances are he won't be warded in IMH (that's when the IMH doctors deem him unsafe to either himself or others). From there, most likely investigations will continue (sent back to HQ lockup to wait) and the IO will interview him more (after which, I'm not sure what will happen but most likely there won't be a ""charge"" on him, especially since you mentioned you did not want to pursue it).But honestly, like the rest have said, and also considering the fact that you're a female (harder to defend for yourself physically speaking), it's honestly best to just go all out against him. There is no point wasting time overthinking about what your parents are going to tell you and what they think about your actions. They don't seem to take your feelings into consideration, honestly. And it will only drag this problem on and on for years to come (which I am sure you are well aware), not only for you but potentially for your other siblings. And even if you do call for the police, they'll more or less tell you the same thing (if he doesn't do anything crazy against you, that is); it will quite literally never stop, unless you do something about it.Right now, you can first try contacting the IO in charge of the case (you should have the name from the case card given to you, if you don't have a case card then go to any police station to retrieve the info by telling them the details of your case). Tell the IO about your concerns and that you changed your mind and want to pursue the matter for the safety of yourself and your siblings. See what the IO says. If you really still don't want to pursue the matter, then at least see how the IO can assist you further in terms of the legal actions you can take against that man or to give you some avenues to look into.Next, you should try and apply for a PPO (Police Protection Order). But the process will be quite tedious, hence I urge you to do it early so you know what are your chances of obtaining it, what's needed for it (evidence?), etc. The PPO is super powerful, no joke. If that man ever tries to harm you or did manage to harm you (you can search about the fine print online) and you call for the police, once it's verified by the police that you do have a PPO against him and that he did breach the PPO based on your words, he will immediately be placed under arrest. No sweat. And of course, if he is indeed found to have breached the PPO after investigations, then this time there will be very concrete consequences (ie, fine or jail or both).As for the abuse you have received, best to consult professionals, such as FSC (Family Service Center) for you and your other family members (highly doubt that man is receptive to any form of communication at this point) and of course psychiatrists if you feel the need.Yeah, sure, as a parent, you wouldn't want your own kid to get into trouble, blah blah. But let's be real, this is your life, and neither you nor your siblings deserve this kind of treatment and fear, much less a prolonged one; worse still, with your own parents coming down on you.So finally, a very very simple question. Would you rather physical and emotional torment from that man for years, or just a general sour relationship with your parents (which right now doesn't seem to be all rainbows and sunshine anyway). Do yourself and your siblings a favor and get rid of that literal toxicity. Anything afterwards will be much easier to handle, trust me. Really hope this helped."
"OP! DO NOT BACK DOWN on the charges ok! protect you and your siblings since your parents lack the responsibility to do so. trust me, he will never stop the abuse if you allow him to continue, for 6 years you believed in him to stop, gave him more than enough chances, look what happened now. by left right centre, get out and protect you and your siblings okay?persuade your parents (who is just a criminal like your brother, recognise that and do not back down or let them make you feel any sense of guilt when all you did was self defence)right now, contact your teachers if you are in uni, or contact your friends or even colleagues that you can trust. make sure if they disown you, you have a place to stayif all things fail, continue the charges to help him get out of his abuse mentality, grab all your siblings, find a real friend or trusted person to stay withif there's no one you can stay with, tell the police and im sure they'll work something out for youRemember, be strong. even if you can't find the motivation to be strong, be strong for your siblings. im sure you dont them to go thru the same things you did. it's difficult to do everything at age 20 but life will only get worse if you dont step up... fighting and stay strong op!"
Is your bro the kind opened to civil discussions? How’s he like as a person? Is he mentally ill?
"If he is open to civil discussions, I doubt there would be 6 years of abuse."
You might want to consider seeking assistance from PAVE. They are a specialist family violence centre with dedicated social workers able to assist you further. Pls stay strong and hang in there. Help is out there! :)
"Do you perhaps have any relatives like aunts& uncles whom are less traditional and can talk sense into your parents? Or grandparents? Even if you're not close, its time for you to speak to them about this - they are family whether or not you're close, and hopefully will be there if your parents arentIf not, find a mentor, teacher/counsellor or leader in your church/mosque(religious) whom you can trust"
"Seek protection. Move to a relatives house, or beg your friends' parents for shelter. Or move to a charity shelter or whatever they call it. Your bro is physically harming you & your parents obviously dont care enough to stop it. Take matters into your own hands. Talk to your school & social workers. Find help somehow. Tell the police the entire situation and that you are not safe to go home. He may hunt you down the moment he is released. Your parents cant love your bro at the expense of you"
"I have a family member in a similar situation. Only difference is that the same case repeated 3-4 times and that person is still not jailed.So don’t worry too much about charges and jaiing. In my situation, the people in charge are more concerned with IMH and therapy than jailing or fining.You can try to file for a personal protection order against him. I am not sure if that requires both of you to first go to court (i have limited legal knowledge)."
"Ts, everyone gave u good advice so I’m not going to write more. I’m gonna say this, NUS is your ticket to a better life. Score it well. U know professors will love to help if you ever need help (I know, trust me in this) but they won’t volunteer to help because students usually don’t get too close to give private info. Just know this avenue if you need help one day.education is the best way of a better life.If you need help one day, come reddit and many will help or PM some of the seniors or me here and we can help as much as we can.Have a good 2-3 years and the new working life will set you free :)"
Yo. Your brother can go fuck himself. He deserve to be punish
"If he was arrested for CI, it's probably more serious than most of us think it is. Your parents aren't protecting you too, which makes things much worse."
"I'll say your brother deserved it. You should let your parents understand that this is something which cannot be swept under the carpet. Its very unhealthy, and you don't want to one day break down from having repressed all the anger and frustration. With reference to his threats:(he threatened to kill all of my siblings and I before committing suicide, even after he has hit me a lot of times)How did the IMH assessment go ? Is he suffering from some mental illness ? e.g. Depression, Bipolar disorder, personality disorder ? If he keeps iterating on his threats, you should look into putting him into the IMH for everyone's safety."
"Well done, as someone that has gone through similar situations, my biggest regret is not gathering enough evidence and going to the police. As for your situation with your parents, the only way to fix it is that they realize that they fucked up and can tell u and your siblings straight to your face that they did.Depending on the course of action u want to take, there are options such as mediation that might spare your brother jail time. However, in case this whole thing goes to shit, my advice would be to seek the help of relatives, especially ones that your parents respect or have the ability to care for your younger siblings, cos if your parents want to bring your brother back home, the priority should be your's and your sibling's safety. In the worst case scenario, a personal protection order can also be filed if u can prove a legitimate threat to u and sibling's safety/life."
"Same. The bruises were enough evidence of the physical abuse.But then, I might not be alive now if I had done that."
Sorry to hear that.
"You're not giving enough information for anyone to give any meaningful advice. All people can say would be based on the partial picture you have painted, it's going to be ""he's a bastard, he deserves jail"" or ""he's still family, go easy on him"".You said he has been abusive for six years, so before he was 16 and you were 15 it was all peachy? Also was there something that triggered the issue or was he the one who randomly started it? You make it sound like you and your parents were just sitting there, and he decided to threaten murder and suicide.If that or something similar to that was really the case, it's likely a mental health issue so the police were right about having to take him to IMH."
"He was been verbally abusive (with the occasional slap) to me since young but the past six years, he started physically abusing me a lot more. Previously, it was just a slap on the face or shove to the wall but then, he started choking me, hitting me with a clothes hanger / belt / shirt etc., throwing me around. In Dec last year, I locked myself in the bedroom after he hit me and he poured kerosene on the bedroom door to start a fire (thankfully, my younger brothers were home and they managed to stop him).Our grandfather died in six years ago and he got worse from there. Everyone else (the parents, uncles, grandmother) favoured him a lot but our grandfather doted on me and I guess it wasn't enough for him. As for my parents, they're legit just sitting there, watching as he make threats and even when he hits me. They always don't interfere because they think that if they do, my brother will keep raging and he'll threaten to burn the house etc. so they'll always push for me to just apologize because it's easier.Maybe it's a mental issue (the police asked if he had anger management) and he's due to go IMH for a check up. Hopefully, he gets the helps he needs."
"Geez he needs professional help. Your parents cannot protect him forever. Once he mingles or lives with other people, they are not going to protect him"
But what triggered him? Does he just get mad out of the blue?
Not immediate one meh
I'm pretty sure him threatening like that is also illegal
"Yes, threatening to commit murder/suicide is indeed illegal."
Both your parents and brother sounds like a complete joke honestly
Maybe you can try family social service or something? And yeah apply every single bursary awards you can find. My sis is currently in uni and applies for every bursary she can find. Gets her like thousands a year.
"Everything you do in public and every police report is recorded by the govt’s system. So in a way, yes your Brother has been charged and there will forever be a smudge in his record.I highly recommend Family counselling, it’s available in those Family Service Centres which can be found under every few HDB flats. The sessions are free for low income and unemployed citizens. You can choose to do individual counselling or persuade your family to do group sessions together.I think it was great that you stood up for yourself and called the cops on your brother’s bitchass. It doesn’t matter if he’s your blood kind, any toxic relationship should be resolved or cut off. Tell him to attend counselling with you, or you will call the cops every time he gets physical with you."
Saw the update. Hope this works out for you. I wish you hadn’t apologised.If it happens again you’re going need to choose. Are you okay with being physically abused continually to not upset your parents and grandparents.
Get some video evidence. For the future. You never know.
"You were right to call the police. Don't let the pressure from your parents get to you, they are clearly not going to resolve the situation properly. Hang in there and stay safe, make sure you have a way to call the police quickly and stealthily if any situation requires it. Remember that you're not the one in the wrong."
Don't forget to lock the doors when you go to sleep at night.
"Based on what you wrote, you did the right thing, not just for yourself, but also for your own self and your own siblings. If he really went rogue and started hurting people, things would be much, much worse. You calling the police in actually might have saved yourself + your siblings from harm.I would seriously recommend seeking help, you need to get away from this brother in case he decides to try anything funny.Regarding the police case, you might want to check with the Investigation Officer (IO) on your police report for any updates on the case. As your parents didn't even contact the police, they're highly unlikely to know anything about the case developments.This PDF might be useful in case you're wondering on typical procedures/what happens when the police takes people into custody."
Perhaps you can consider installing CCTV for a start? I'm worried about your safety as well as your parents safety.
"If your siblings are below 16 years old, you can try MSF's Child Protective Service. But do note that in the worse case scenario, they are empowered to remove children and young persons from their parents.As you are 20 years old, I don't think MSF can intervene. However, you can apply for a PPO against your older brother so that he will at least think twice about making you a target.I'm sorry to say this but it sounds like prison/IMH is where your brother need to go to get the help he needs, if he still can be rehabilitated. Also, you will probably need to leave your parents' home if they condone your older brother's behavior because they are only enabling him.Another suggestion is involving your extended family. Uncles, aunts, grandparents, the like. Anyone who may be able to help."
Stay strong girl.
Stay safe :/

"Very Cathay-looking. Rather unassuming presence in the CBD which people just walk past, but I quite like the look of this building."
"It is sort of Art Deco. There are elements that shows it but isn’t fully realised, probably due to cost. The strong symmetry, crown at the top, overhangs at the windows with curved corners, vertical stripes at the middle and the dramatic curve of the overhang at the top are characteristic elements of Art Deco."
"My sentiments exactly. Also really liked the single columns of windows in the middle, and of course the stripes and choice of cyan colour."
"Yes I would say art deco-inspired. Many of the facade elements, for example the vertical lines and the flag pole are found on shophouses that date from the 1930s-60s."
It does look nice :D
"I suspect it was be built shortly before WWII, similar in style to the SIT flats in Tiong Bahru. The concrete sunshades reflect the desire to show off new technology (of that time) of reinforced concrete being able to create those thin forms. I’d say it probably was designed and built at a time where Art Deco was going out of style."
"I work in the building next to it. Made a damn lame joke about how the chief marketing officers we are selling our marketing SaaS product to are all housed here so we can look for them there, ha ha ha."
Can explain the joke? Lol
"My company sells marketing SaaS and so chief marketing officers are the decision makers that we would ideally target. CMO is short for chief marketing officer so the joke was that the chief marketing officers we wanna target to sell our products to are in that building, so don’t need to go around cold calling or lead gen to try and “find” them."
OMG. Actually that's a good one😂 😂 😂
😂😂😂
No AC. Looks hot inside.
Cannot make out
Just cheap building facade disguised as art deco
"Nowhere close.Google Buffalo City Hall, Wells Fargo Tower, or Chrysler Building for real Art Deco."
"Can't say that I agree here, maybe you have very purist views on what it should be."
"Objectively speaking, this building does not feature the structural tapering, mosaics, ornaments, or even the basic requirements for the Art Deco style.This, this, or this are examples of Art Deco.That building just has some vertical lines on the facade. If anything, this follows the Streamline trends of later years."
"I see what you mean now. And also, learnt something newhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamline_ModerneVery nice and funky movement, really liking it also."
"Streamline ModerneStreamline Moderne is an international style of Art Deco architecture and design that emerged in the 1930s. It was inspired by aerodynamic design. Streamline architecture emphasized curving forms, long horizontal lines, and sometimes nautical elements. In industrial design, it was used in railroad locomotives, telephones, toasters, buses, appliances, and other devices to give the impression of sleekness and modernity.[ ^PM | Exclude ^me | Exclude from ^subreddit | FAQ / ^Information | ^Source ] Downvote to remove | v0.28"
"Yeah, a lot of buildings in Malaysia and Singapore are actually Art Moderne and not really Art Deco per se."
"Art Moderne? Interesting, any specific examples?"
"Any older buildings built from the time of 30s-70s; on top of my head, the Tiong Bahru Club and its surroundings, Waterboat House owned by Fullerton, the buildings around Keong Saik Road. I recall seeing some along sungei road. Many articles will call these buildings as Art Deco, which isn't technically wrong because Art Deco is the umbrella term, but Moderne will be closer to the architectural style."
"Waterboat HouseThis resembled the Streamlined movement as pointed out earlier, thanks for sharing."
How would you describe the general aesthetic of Singapore buildings?
"Good evening Singapore,So I shall be moving to your city in the end of March. Extremely excited, we will be moving from shanghai - myself, Wife, 2 dogs and a cat. I’d like to get a mrt card with a picture of all our animals on for my Wife - I know she will love that. Is there any way I can do this easily? Will be over in early March for a home finding trip so looking to do it then.Thanks so much!"
Welcome to Singapore (soon)! I hint you mean you'd like an EZ-Link card with a family photo on it. For that you can try Custom Cards which does custom EZ-Link card designs for around SGD $12 with free shipping. (Not sure if they can ship overseas though!) All the best!https://www.customcards.com.sg/
Perfect thanks so much!
Thanks! I was looking for something like that. This is great!
"Yo bro, surprise to see you here on reddit haha"
Wait wait who are you lol pm me
There are companies which provide Ez-Link/NETS FlashPay cards customisation which you can find easily by googling. Typically you'll need to submit a photo fitting their requirements and they will let you know that it's approved and mail the final product to you when it's done.
Thanks! Is this in case my miniature schnauzer is too good looking? Not sure of the approval requirements but it will be two dogs and a cat - just hanging out I guess!
"Yes. If your Schnauzer is too beautiful for this world or posing in a suggestive manner, the photo may be classified as porn and rejected. Select your photo wisely.Also, make sure the resolution, size and colour profile adheres to the guidelines provided by the printer."
I dunno - if I was a male schnauzer. https://i.imgur.com/Fd8XQTO.jpg
That certainly looks a bit borderline. Perhaps dress her more conservatively .
"Slightly off topic, consider getting a Nets Flashpay card instead of a ezlink card as it can be used at more retailers."

"Tfw I can afford Airpods but I don't use Spotify Premium or NetflixBut serious question, are Airpods decent? I had a pair of Bose bluetooth headphones and they sounded MUCH better when using a headphone jack"
"Depending on the shape of your ear canal, the airpod might keep dislodging and you will eventually end up with a podcase with no pods."
What about sound quality?
"airpods are more for convenience than sound, it doesn't seal your ear canal so sound isn't that great compared to other in-ear options"
"Ah ok, I use a pair of Sennheiser momentum in ears, any idea if there is a comparable loss of quality?"
"airpods basically sound like normal earpods but with more bass. Sennheiser momentums are next level in sound. You could get some Momentum True Wireless if you want the convenience of an airpod, but sound of a Sennheiser but its like $400+"
"Ah ok, switching back to the earbuds they give you feels so weird after using momentums"
They look ridiculous. I wish they were more inconspicuous. And I don't know why they're mentioned on the list. There are more expensive Bluetooth buds.
No 4 should be higher. The max fare can be 2-3x the supposed care and can you get transfer discount for the next ride?

"""he is ever-present but low profile.""Well, until now..."
Never knew tan chuan jin was a policeman
LOL at first I thought the article was referring to him as the bodyguard for the Johor prince.
"""Escorting a member of the Johor royal family – and that member being the crown prince - is a dream for anybody"" what the fuck is he on?"
That accompanying photo makes it look like TCJ is the bodyguard sia.
"My wife and I are Americans living in Shanghai, thinking about a move to Singapore and coming to check it out. I’ve only ever been for work, so my experience is limited.We will do some neighborhood checks and school visits, but looking to hear what the “must see” places are to get the best feel for the city."
"Ya. I mentioned we will already be looking at schools and neighborhoods. We have relocated internationally twice and know the drill.Just wanting some suggestions of places to check out that are not touristy. The local places where you all go on weekends, or evenings out. Where my family, or me and my wife will want to go for a dinner or entertainment."
"Here are some places that local families hang out:- Botanic Gardens. Great place for family picnics. They sometimes have a live band playing or movie screenings.- East Coast Park. Cycling is a popular past time here, and there's a park connector cycling route that takes you through different parks in the country- Esplanade area for live bands, museum light-ups etc.- Sentosa beaches for a chill day by the beach.I personally like the vibe at Haji Lane area for a night out without the kids. The bars Bluz Jaz and Om are pretty nice. Do drop by Untitled cafe if you're in the area for some really good rose coffee. The Projector is also in the vicinity - it is a pretty cool indie cinema where you can to lie back on sofa seats and big pillows.For food, hawker centres are quite popular with the locals. Great ones to start with are at Old Airport Road, Chinatown Food Complex and Changi Food Village.The cafe scene is really big here, and locals love doing brunch over the weekend. You can explore Holland Village or Keong Saik Road area, or travel down to more popular options like Lola's, Common Man Coffee Roasters or Forty Hands."
"try taking a train to punggol and checking out waterway point (neighborhood shopping center)-> waterway park (recreation park) -> take a bus down to tebing lane or punggol settlement (""non-city"" bars and restaurants / late night entertainment)i think that gives a pretty good feel of how neighborhoods will be like for the average singaporean"
"Thanks for all the suggestions. We have a Thursday through Monday trip planned, so it will be good to check out weekend fun as well."
"maybe you can connect with tis guy; https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/au72z8/custom_mrt_card_stickers/also, which neighborhoods?"
"If you are thinking of moving here, instead of""must see"" places, check out these locations:where you may stay.school for kids if any.nearby workplace.take a drive during peak hours if you do plan to drive to work. Or public transport.the locals food during work.Tourist opinion isn't a good gauge to aid in a move decision."
There's a thread here with pretty good suggestions https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/arjfiq/52_places_to_visit_in_singapore/I've also sent you a PM!
Those are not really places local go and visit on a frequent basis.
"I know this usually depends on the artist and how they charge, but I’m trying to get a rough idea on how much I might have to pay for my tattoos.I’m planning on getting a full sleeve and perhaps a few other small pieces on other various parts of my body. (I have 18 designs, 4 used for sleeve and 12 smaller designs for other parts of my body)If anybody has gotten tattoos, especially full sleeve tattoos, do you mind sharing how much you paid for your pieces and how artists usually charge their clients ?All inputs are appreciatedThanks in advance :)"
If you wanna see a whole bunch of local artist in one day I suggest going to the show ink convention (should be in april) it's a paid event but you get to see a lot including artist from other countries. Price point is hard to say but you would be willing to pay more to get it done from an artist that you are comfortable with.

"1.8k so far into my Japanese sleeve, estimated 3k upon completion"
"Oh okay, thank you. I think that might be a rough estimate of how much I might be paying for my sleeve too !"
have a back tattoo 20x10 that cost 600 and 3 hours to do. so 200 for an hour like what the comment below mentioned
Thanks !
"also, if you don’t mind sharing, who’s the artist that did your tattoo ?"
@adela_tattooer on Instagramshe's a Korean tattoo artist that guested in sg awhile back
Her work is awesomeeeeeeeeee
"Oh okay, thank you !"
able to share your tattoo designs? im planning to get a small one on my arm for commemorative purposes but i have no idea what to put on haha. any recommendation from the rest is good too!
"My ideas aren’t written designed yet. Like I know what I want to get per say.For example, just 1 idea I have in mind is that I want a lion tattoo because it represents my background and family stuff.To me, my tattoo ideas have a lot of meaning to it. If you want something fun, maybe get something that relates to your childhood ?"
I’m a big boy and I’ve got two full sleeves. Left one is nearing completion at 35 hours. Probably another 5 hours and it’s good. 200 bucks an hour for a good artist - really does depend on the complexity though.
"Oh okay, I don’t think my sleeve will take that long as I’ll be getting individual pieces to fit the sleeve. Maybe I’m guessing my sleeve will take maybe 10-12 hours.Thanks for informing me !"
You getting lots of big smiley faces? A 10-12 hour sleeve does not seem overly feasible unless it’s very very basic.
I could see a sleeve being done in 12 hours if it's American traditional. Def not Japanese traditional or anything else of similar complexity
"There are certain parts in my sleeve that won’t be tattooed. It’s not gonna be on my entire arm.It will be something that’s good but it’s not going to be too complex.As for placement, it will be my inner and outer wrist and my bicep."
Ok I gotcha - so not really a sleeve.
It's a sticker book!
/r/gatekeeping
He's right though... It's not a sleeve if there isn't full coverage
I have two large symbols on my both arms (about half a sleeve length) that were 300-400 a piece.EDIT: I don't normally comment on downvotes but I have to give a big shout out and an even bigger GET FUCKED to whoever downvoted. My tattoos filter out pretentious smug cunts like yourself. Go be happy working in a cubicle living your sterile 9-5 job.
"If you don’t mind sharing, who was the artist that did your tattoo ?"
Got mine at Ink by Finch at Peninsular.

Dont need but this also means you gonna serve the full 2 years instead of 1 year 10 months.
Ah thanks and is it true that people who have earlier birthdays go in earlier? The July batch compared to the October one.
"I have heard of the trend and experienced it too but not true all the time. Nobody knows. If u wanna enter uni, the october batch u have to disrupt NS because uni term starts on august every year. Very troublesome."
"nope don’t need. source: am pes b3 (essentially the same as b4, enlisted together as b3/b4 batch)"
the website got say ma don't need early
Congrats to that dude. I have every resource I could dream of but I can’t pull off what he did.

Now you know where to go if you want good exam results.
"Changi prison, the 17th best JC in Singapore."
"To be fair, only 5 out of 34 qualified for local uni. It's a bit lower than the JCs."
"Considering the less-than-conducive environment of a fucking prison, that statistic is downright impressive"
Yeh how did they manage to study without going to a Starbucks ..
One would say that theres not much of a difference
inb4 our education system is like prison.
I love hyperboles
you could make a case for it being all the more conducive. maybe im just bitter i flunked it while being very much outside a prison.
"On the contrary, there are far less distractions in prison. And huge motivation for reformed. Though perhaps limited access to things like tuition teachers I suppose."
"Pa, send me to prison"
"Anyone know what subjects the cohort took? Impressive work tbh, but now I'm curious to know lol.And of course the mothership article doesnt add anything new beyond rebroadcasting a FB post..."

Come back again when the Civil service will take them in for those excellent grades
Tiagong the private uni lady who had an affair and stabbed her husband 11 times was hired back in civil service after serving her sentence.
"A Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) senior human resource executive originally charged with killing her husband was sentenced to one year's jail yesterday for causing grievous hurt on grave and sudden provocation.Vivien Teoh Yi Wen's sentence was backdated to her remand on Sept 1 last year, which means the 27-year-old mother of one could be released.She admitted to the amended charge of fatally stabbing her husband, Mr Gordon Yeo Han Tong, 33, in the chest with a knife at their flat in Senja Road in August last year.Court documents say he had physically assaulted her and threatened to kill her and their daughter, as their marriage had broken down .When it was all over, Mr Yeo's parents appeared upset. His 60-year-old mother wept, calling the one-year sentence ""unfair'' and accusing Teoh's family members, who were speaking to her briefly through the door of the holding area, of being ""inhumane''.Deputy Public Prosecutors Eugene Lee and Krystle Chiang said that on Aug 30 last year, Teoh had locked herself in the master bedroom with her 14-month-old daughter, and refused to let her husband in.The couple were sleeping in different rooms and she was making preparations for divorce.When she emerged later to get milk for the baby, her husband confronted her in the kitchen and asked why she had locked the door. He tried to block her path but she managed to get free and return to the room.He followed her and pushed his way in, but they agreed to talk outside so as not to disturb the child.Suspecting his wife of cheating on him, Mr Yeo snatched her phone to read the messages. He pinned her down and choked her while she swung her arms to get him to stop.When he released her but refused to return the phone, Teoh kicked at him. He wrapped his arm around her neck in a chokehold while they fought over the phone, ending up in the kitchen toilet, where he pushed her head against the mirror.He badgered her for her passcode, which she eventually gave and he started to read through her messages.Teoh then went to get her child, who was crying. Carrying the baby into the kitchen, she went to the service yard, closed the folding doors and shouted: ""Help, my husband is trying to kill me!""Mr Yeo kicked the door open, causing the baby to fall and hit her head. He had a knife and ordered his wife to return to the master bedroom.There, he started going through her phone and told her she had one last chance to confess.Teoh admitted that she had been having an affair. Angered, he said he would kill her, their daughter and himself.Subsequently, Teoh went to the kitchen to get ice for the child. She grabbed a knife and brandished it at her husband who told her to drop it. She refused and retreated to the master bedroom.Mr Yeo also got a knife and went to the room. Husband and wife circled each other and when he kept on advancing, she swung her knife wildly at him, inflicting wounds including one that penetrated his heart.Teoh then called her mother before leaving the flat with her daughter.Mr Goh, who had 11 stab wounds on his torso and interscapular region, was pronounced dead at 1.19am by paramedics.Teoh's lawyer Yusfiyanto Yatiman said his client was under an acute stress reaction and adjustment disorder at the time. He said she had been under emotional abuse from her husband for an extended period of time and that his sexual behaviour was perverse.Calling it a sad and tragic case, District Judge Low Wee Ping said he hoped Teoh could find some solace and closure, to look after and bring up her daughter. Teoh, who was calm, responded several times with: ""Thank you, Your Honour .""The judge told her: ""You will find that in time, this will come to pass, although, of course, it will be difficult, but I would wish you to look forward.''Teoh could have been jailed for up to six years and/or fined up to $10,000 for the offence.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/woman-gets-one-year-for-grievous-hurt-to-hubby-on-provocation"
"Wow, not to condone murder but it all sounds like it was in self-defence and after a long term of abuse. It also sounds like he picked up a knife before she did.The fact that the guy’s family was thick-skinned enough to say what they did to the woman and her family is grating."
"Another news reported that the lady didn't have any bruises, other than a self inflicted wound.The family was still seen as normal by neighbors before the murder. And fb still had happy family posts.The question everyone couldn't understand is what why it wasn't capable homicide, which covers killing people due to self defense and provocation."
"TNP reported she ""had bruises all over her body and head. She also had fingermarks on her neck.""Their marriage of almost two years was on the rocks.Not only did they sleep in separate bedrooms, they also barely talked. And they texted each other if they needed to communicate.In August last year, things came to a head with tragic consequences.The wife would later tell the police that her husband, suspecting her of cheating on him, had attacked her - choking and hitting her until she confessed to the affair.Then, armed with a knife, he threatened to kill her and their 14-month-old daughter.She reacted by grabbing a knife and later stabbing him in the chest, puncturing his heart and killing him.Yesterday, Vivien Teoh Yi Wen, now 27, was jailed for a year for causing grievous hurt to her husband, Mr Gordon Yeo Han Tong, 33, on grave and sudden provocation.The sentence was backdated to when she was remanded. She has served her time and is now free.A search on the Registry of Marriages website shows that the couple got married on Oct 5, 2013.Their daughter was born in June 2014.By August last year, their relationship had soured. Though they still lived together in a four-room HDB flat in Block 636B, Senja Road, in Bukit Panjang, they slept in different bedrooms, and seemed to communicate only by texting, according to court papers.Mr Yeo, who was vice-president of business development at an IT company, based on his Linkedin profile, was preparing to divorce his wife, whom he suspected of having an affair with a colleague.THE QUARRELOn Aug 30, at about 10.30pm, Teoh, a senior human resource executive at the Ministry of Social and Family Development, was in the master bedroom with her daughter when she texted Mr Yeo to tell him to stop driving her car because he did not have a valid licence.Unhappy, he knocked on the bedroom door, but she refused to let him in.The knocking eventually woke their daughter up, and Teoh texted Mr Yeo to go away, but he refused.At about 11.25pm, the lights and the air-conditioning in the master bedroom suddenly went off.Suspecting her husband had switched off the electricity in a bid to draw her out, Teoh texted her mother.The mother later told her that her father had spoken to Mr Yeo, who said there had been a power trip. The electricity came back on soon after.Teoh later went out to get milk for their daughter, and was confronted by Mr Yeo in the kitchen.He demanded to know why she had locked her room door. When she ignored him, he blocked her way out of the kitchen.Teoh managed to get past him and scrambled back to the bedroom, but he barged in. So as not to disturb their daughter, they agreed to go outside to talk.But when Mr Yeo tried to snatch her mobile phone, she screamed.THE FIGHTHe pushed and pinned her to the floor, and choked her.She swung her arms at him, and he released his grip on her to grab her mobile phone, which displayed a text message from her colleague.When Mr Yeo refused to give the phone back to her, Teoh kneed him in the groin area. He retaliated by wrapping his arm around her neck in a chokehold.She then punched him in the groin, causing him to drop the phone. Before she could pick it up, he grabbed it and threw it towards the common toilet.She dashed to retrieve it, but he grabbed her head and hit it against the toilet mirror.Teoh heard her daughter crying and told her husband that they had to attend to her.Mr Yeo let Teoh leave, picked up her phone and followed her to the bedroom, where he badgered her to unlock the phone. After she unlocked it, he scrolled through her messages as their daughter started crying again.Teoh carried the baby to the kitchen to get a pacifier. At the kitchen service yard, she shouted: ""Help, my husband is trying to kill me.""Mr Yeo kicked the bi-fold door and it slammed into their daughter, who fell and hit her head. He grabbed a knife, pointed it at his wife and told her to return to the master bedroom.She checked her daughter for injuries as he browsed through her phone messages. When he told her she had one last chance to confess, she admitted that she had been cheating on him.Enraged, Mr Yeo told his wife that he was going to kill her and their daughter before taking his own life.Teoh then carried the baby into the kitchen to get ice for her head as Mr Yeo followed behind.THE STABBINGIn the kitchen, she grabbed a knife from the drawer with her right hand, and brandished it at him while carrying the baby with her left arm.He ordered her to drop the knife, but she refused and retreated to the master bedroom. Along the way, she saw Mr Yeo's phone on the bed of his room.She went in to take his phone so she could call for help, but he barged in and closed the door.Teoh pointed the knife at Mr Yeo and tried to grab his phone.Mr Yeo, who was still holding a knife, closed the curtains - making the room even darker as the lights were off - and moved towards his wife, who warned him to stay away.As he continued towards her, he told her that it would be her fault if their daughter were to die.At this point, Teoh lost her self-control and swung the knife at her husband, stabbing him.She then fled the unit with their daughter - accidentally cutting herself with the knife in the process - and met her mother at a nearby block.The mother then called the police.Mr Yeo was pronounced dead at 1.19am on Aug 31. He was later found to have 11 stab wounds, the first of which pierced his heart.He also suffered five potentially fatal wounds to his liver, omentum and colon.Teoh had bruises all over her body and head. She also had fingermarks on her neck.She was initially charged with murder last September.For causing grievous hurt on sudden and grave provocation, Teoh could have been jailed up to six years and fined up to $10,000.https://stomp.straitstimes.com/singapore-seen/courts-crime/woman-who-stabbed-hubby-to-death-after-he-attacked-her-and-threatened-to"
"Oh I must have messed up that detail.Still, why is it not capable homicide?"
I'm guessing it was a plea deal. She plead guilty and in exchange the prosecution reduces the charge. Happens quite often.
"You can't blame people for having doubts since in a typical case, you can't claim self defence if you stabbed someone 11 times."
"Key difference:She's a woman.I wonder why of all the foul things posted on Edmw, why threads of her always get taken down?"
"wasn't a guy kissing a guy, not news."
"Reading the article, the key difference is actually that she killed him in self-defence. 🙄"
"She claimed self-defence, that's not necessarily what the courts concur. Hell, any normal murderer would claim the victim made them do it."
"Did you read the case? Please don’t try to force a narrative of “she’s only getting off almost scot-free because she’s a woman” here just because of your personal gender victimhood mentality. Unless you believe your individual opinion to be more informed and objective than that of the collective findings and conclusions of the investigators and legal professionals, the article and judge’s ruling both make it clear that the court deemed the act punishable as a crime still but also out of self-defence."
""
Unlikely.
"Did you follow that thread on edmw? Someone actually emailed ncss (did I get the org right?), but didn't get a reply. Her name was removed from the directory, but still could see her online on communicator sometimes."
Oh I didn’t see. Then again I know one guy who Harrass male underlings with gay advances and Kena reported like mad but no punishment so you never know.

Almost as if criminals can also be intelligent people too
"Criminals can also be very intelligent. Misguided, I suppose?"
Pssh wait till there really is a smart one who commit crimes just for the thrills
"Almost as if?Some of them are just as, if not more, intelligent than you."
Lmao don't get me wrong I'm pretty dumb I'm sure most of the population is more intelligent than me.I'm saying the headline seems to imply (to me) that it's unexpected and that just because they're incarcerated means they can't do well academically.
Ok la. Just facts. I don't really see any problem with it.
Why is Marina Bay Sands not realistic when most everything else is?
"Most likely licensing issues. Therefore, developers had to take some creative liberties to avoid kena sued"
"MBS images are everywhere. Why only Ace Combat decided they'd be sued? And why only for this building and not e.g. Swissotel or Fullerton Hotel which are accurately depicted?Free MBS images, nobody is suing them: https://www.shutterstock.com/search/marina+bay+sands?studio=1"
Maybe... including MBS will make it too recognizable as Singapore?
Usage of image or likeness for commercial purposes is different.
Why does no other hotel get deleted from the game?
Maybe they asked for permission and got it?
"Well, one possibility is that mixing flight simulators and iconic buildings are taboo after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. Microsoft removed collision physics in their last and only version of flight sim afterward. It is a sad and arguably not very effective reason, but global marketing and legal compliance teams for publishers really push back on it."
"But the Swissotel is shown, and is an iconic building. And even the ArtScience Museum is not shown in AC7, and surely that is less iconic than the Swissotel. It seems the entire MBS property complex is omitted, so I think it's a commercial issue (but can't find the specifics)."
"Quite possibly, and that seems like good speculation as well. I was working as a game dev for Microsoft when the global team made the decision for Flight Sim. That was also a legal liability concern.Either way, most likely a legal team decision, not a dev team decision. We don't leave things like that out on purpose unless the publisher throws a fit about it :)"
majulah as fuck

"I wish more games would depict Singapore, even fictionally. It is one of the most diverse places (each neighborhood has a distinct character) and there are plenty of large ""green"" spaces to be found. Even plenty of smaller islands to use as a story-telling landscape. Everything from old kampung to downtown core, with massive parks, inland reservoir, hills all kinds of play spaces available!Driving, skating, wing suits, parkour chases through HDB void decks and public spaces, city sims, MRT underground -- Fallout 3 had a pretty decent rendition of the DC subway for example. There are tons of open-world possibilities!"
Hope some singaporean developers can make a great game then. Maybe GTA 6 in Singapore? I would play the hell out of it.
"I love how the game dev ecosysyem has been growing in Singapore, but there is still way too much focus on mobile and F2P and not enough AAA development. Ubisoft has been a rock-solid presence for a long time. Pixel and the incubator at the old JTC may help, but Singapore really needs to make it easier for the industry to do actual develop!ent in the country. Not just for electronic entertainment, but for tech overall."
"Its probably because triple A games are 'high risk, high reward' while mobile games need virtually nothing in comparison and can reap larger profits.. the games will go to where the money is."
"True everywhere. Risk is mitigated by talent (MoM has been really good about this in practice, but on paper, outsiders think it will be hard to get the right talent to work in Singapore, thanks to the ""white paper"" back in 2011 and outward-facing rules). It is mitigated by cash flow projections, and Western AAA game developers try to compare costs in Singapore with their home countries. No game dev I know, except Singaporeans, actually own a car, but a $100k expense for a new hire just to get around town will scare the crap out of anyone making a plan to set up shop in Singapore.Outsiders have no idea how well suited to development Singapore actually is. Amazing infrastructure. Good talent pool to grow with industry experience. Unbeleivably efficient bureaucracy (unheard of anywhere else on the planet). Hawker food is so inexpensive and good nobody needs their own kitchen or to eat at chain restaurants. Public transport is way more reliable than most places in the world (I know, MRT interruptions happen, and it is front page news, but I was never late for work and I took the MRT every day). A very fair, progressive tax regime that puts almost every other country to shame.From the outside, publishers considering Singapore see a different story. They see it as a gamble to even get an employment pass for their best developers and designers (their legal teams will point that out). Until they are actually working with ACRA and have BizFile up and running, the accounting system (as ludicrously efficient as it is) is a black box. They hear it is the most expensive city to live in (again, different standards for transportation, nobody needs or should even want to get a car and pay CoE). Then there is the ""caning for chewing bubblegum totalitarian state myth"" that is a huge turn off. Also, the criminalization (and like most other laws, near zero enforcement of) homosexuality, where most modern developers have a more openly diverse workforce and would not want to risk imprisonment just to have their best developers work alongside other Singaporeans. From the outside (and I am telling everyone this is not close to the truth) they see Singapore as an authoritarian, backward country that values ethnicity and religion over actual outcomes and use the power of the state in a ""zero-tolerance"" way that most Western countries do. It is a false and fundamental misunderstanding of how Singapore actually works, but that is what they see.This really boils down to (unfortunate) political problems that are easily identified and corrected. Singaporeans know how to do this. They did it in the 1960's, 1980's and in the 2000's. Singaporeans are the first people to criticize themselves about their country, which is their strength. LKY called Singaporeans ""great complainers"", but that was not a condemnation, it is what kept everyone accountable and on their toes. I was in Singapore when he died (it rained a lot). I was on the street solely for his funeral procession (it rained again, really hard that day). Tough old bastard like everyone's grandfather that every other world leader wanted to emulate, but they could not because he was that one of a kind that was about getting stuff done.Singapore could replace Silicone Valley not just in Asia, but in the world. There is even an ""honorary block 75"" in the SV area of California, so what is stopping that from happening? I would play the hell out of a GTA VI based in Singapore with Uniquely Singaporean protagonists. Why can that not happen today?"
"Wow, thats a really informative and well thought-out comment! I have to say, i really agree with what you have to say.Yeah in Singapore no one needs a car, but everyone does want one as its a status symbol of sorts.Also i can understand how LGBT laws might actually prevent foreign investment into the country. This is really interesting as the government is always interested in maintaining high levels of foreign direct investment (especially now, since other cities states are growing at the same pace)Yeah, singapore is definitely not as zero tolerance as the western media believes, our lives are relatively quite free here!"
"The free-ist in the world. My advice to anyone visiting (Western or PRC): don't be a jerk that people have to complain about to the police. Be civil and a good guest if you visit. Singapore is the only place I am homesick for when I am away. Every Singaporean friend of mine thinks I am crazy for feeling that way, but within a couple of years, we are planning reuinions around CNY anyway :)"
"He said the Merdeka Package was the ""icing on top of the cake"" whenever we have some extra resourcesIf it really is such an ""extra"" thing, why not get rid of this uneccessary expenditure so we dont need to raise gst to 9%?Participants discussed how they would spend a hypothetical $10 million sum for the country, in five areas such as security, social spending, and savingsNotice how cutting taxes and taking the money out of the hands of the government isn't even an option.""Some people ask, why is it that people make promises at elections and why is it that we take them to task? And the simple reason is that if you make promises at an election, you have not yet earned the money. How can you promise to spend the money?By that logic no opposition party will ever be allowed to make election promises because all the preceeding governments will be PAP and they will never have ""earned"" the money."
"Notice how cutting taxes and taking the money out of the hands of the government isn't even an option.For the sake of discussion, if you had to cut some government spending, what would you cut?By that logic no opposition party will ever be allowed to make election promises because all the preceeding governments will be PAP and they will never have ""earned"" the money.By his logic, doing 5 year plans is also pointless, since you don't know how global and economic conditions might change."
"For the sake of discussion, if you had to cut some government spending, what would you cut?Let me just preface this with the fact that we don't have a comprehensive picture of government expenditure. The budget breaks down spending into individual ministries but doesn't talk about specific programs and initiatives. As much as I would like to be able to go through the budget line by line, no one really knows how much is spent and where outside of high profile policy announcements. Not to mention bureaucratic imperialism, cultural problems, the labyrinth of government funded organisations, waste and duplication, as well as the ""national security"" screen surrounding spending in MINDEF, MFA and MHA.Looking purely at more accessible sources, here are a few areas we can reduce spending:Bicentennial fund and SG bonusMerdeka and Pioneer generation packages (if they really are just ""icing"")Productivity and innovation creditSkillsfutureGST voucherPeople's associationConsolidating the HSA, HPB and AVAConsolidating the National Arts Council and National Heritage BoardConsolidating the URA, SLA and BCAConsolidating Nparks and NEAConsolidating SPRING, IE and EDBCivil Service CollegeSingapore Labour Foundationgenerous scholarships for foreign studentsgenerous contracts for Phds to work at NUS to boost rankingI'd also like to see all forms of welfare and subsidies for lower income groups consolidated and simplified (perhaps in the form of a negative income tax) into monthly lump sum payments and managed by a single agency, which would reduce a lot of the administrative overheads. Finally, I'd create a bureaucratic watchdog agency whose sole purpose would be to analyse budget requests, investigate waste and duplication and limit the growth of the government."
"Wow that's a lot of cuts! :) Definitely some interesting ideas there, and it would be worth if the govt could defend why some of those need to be funded (I never even heard of the Singapore Labour Foundation for starters).I think subsidies for the less well off should indeed be consolidated - it would make it easier for the poor to apply for and collect their payments, and it would reduce the overhead in administering the payments."
">SkillsfutureI do agree with this. People know that these program/lesson are available, so maybe they can cut this funding off? Some of the lessons are beneficial, like IT skills, but just like some other post in r/sg pointed out some people learn how to fly a drone with it. I don't see why taxpayers are funding that.> generous scholarships for foreign studentsWhy are we funding them again? Hoping that they will stay and pump our economy? I'm pretty sure they will get the papers they need and jump to a greener pasture.The point about consolidating all subsidies for lower income group into one lump sum would be an issue. There are too many different issues and problem that people have and if we lump them into one agency to handle, they would need to have multiple division within them and will be super overloaded. Current system is ok, but I think we could just improve by just shrinking the amount of agency issuing them. Maybe make them more accessible to the public on what welfare are available on a common platform?The last point, I think there's an agency that do auditing for the government already."
just to address the last point. auditing means ensuring that the PROCESSES taken to spend money and collect money are safeguarded and well implemented. That is to say are you spending on the correct program? is the funds removed or received by an authorised personnel? was the correct amount of funds used for a program? but it doesn't tell you how you should allocate your money or how many programs you can come up with/spend on. I think that is what the previous dude is trying to say that there is a lot of duplicated spending and layers of red tape that can be cut down.
Lol everything say until so easy like that
"Wow, I'm sure you have better ideas to contribute other than playing down the validity of his suggestions and enforcing the status quo."
"There is as little thought put into enforcing the status quo as there is in a strategy that basically just says ""reduce spending, small government""The latter doesn't even make sense when the big risk in the future (not just according to me) is secular stagnation due to demographic changes. And a reduction in spending is not even something voters and politicians want; it's a very weird thing to be suggesting at this point in time. In any case the current strategy is hardly enforcing the status quo when taxes are being raised and spending is projected to increase.I probably could have said all this at the start but tbh the comment just had so many seemingly careless broad-brush statements to cover that it really didn't feel worth a serious response to each of them"

"He said the Merdeka Package was the ""icing on top of the cake"" to help the most vulnerable. ""And it's also an expression of our values that whenever we have some extra resources, we care for those who have contributed to Singapore the most, those who are most in need,"" he said. ""By sharing it equally, actually we don't give as much help as we would like to those who need it the most."" In response to questions on why there is not a simpler, universal scheme - instead of one that involves means testing - he said that an across-the-board policy would not be fair as it could apply to all regardless of income.Correct me if I'm wrong... isn't the Merdeka Package given regardless of income (as long as age and citizenship requirements are satisfied)?"
One could argue that the elderly is a vulnerable group
Rich elderly are not vulnerable though.
"So they deserve less? The essence of the package is to reward the generation for their contributions, not a welfare scheme."
"I mean, we can nitpick at the wordings all we want, his very point is that Merdeka Package is NOT what we should be focussing on to examine welfareFor example CHAS card was extended to all SGeans, with various priviliges for various income groups"

"Hey everyone! I'm travelling from the US and I'm excited to be staying in Singapore for a 3 days in late April. I was wondering it there's are some good websites or resources to check out to see help me figure out what I want to do. Here's some things I'd like to figure out:Food. Singapore has a lot of great regional cuisine and a really diverse food culture. I'm looking forward to trying it all. Where are the best markets and food stalls as well as restaurants?Festivals, events in April. Are there any special events going on when I'm there (April 22-25)?Hiking. I'd like to take a day to visit a nearby park. Anything good spots?"
Check out visitsingapore.com
There's a useful list here -https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/au6d0r/thank_you_singapore_for_our_wonderful_visit_we/Hiking - I'll recommend the Southern Ridges walk https://www.visitsingapore.com/see-do-singapore/nature-wildlife/parks-gardens/the-southern-ridges/The Singapore sub-reddit usually has a list of events for every month. (eg https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aklifv/whats_happening_in_february_2019/). Check back here in end March for April's list!I've sent you a PM too!
"Hiya, I'm a half-American that's lived here for five years.Food - Hawker Centers, they are everywhere. You can get Chinese, Indian and Malay food I recommend trying the Prata and Steamed Buns.Festivals - You just missed Chinese New Year, rip, as far as I know there is no festivals in AprilHiking - Pulau Ubin is the best place for walks, there is a good chance to see wild monkeys and boars. There's also trails in Mt. Faber and Macritchie Reservoir."
Singapore sign language is influenced by:Shanghainese Sign LanguageAmerican Sign LanguageSigning Exact EnglishLocally developed signs.This make me wonder can als and sgsl understand each other?
"Hello! Sign Languages are not universal, so there are differences between every country’s sign language.However, there may be some signs that are similar! Off the top of my head, I think the sign for ‘know’ is the same in both ASL and SgSL, but the sign for ‘happy’ is different.Hope this helps :—)"
Are there efforts to merge the sign languages?
"Not any more than there are efforts to merge English, American English, Canadian English, Indian English, African English, Singapore English, Malaysian English, Australian English etc, or even within the UK to merge Northern/Southern/Scottish/Irish/Welsh English. I know you didn't mean it in a bad way but it's quite presumptuous to suggest that languages need to be merged. Imagine if tomorrow the Queen declared that ""pants"" strictly mean undergarments and we must use ""trousers"" to refer to, well, trousers, you would probably think it's ridiculous and overreaching."
"There's also ISL, which is used at events like the world federation for the deaf Congress, when everyone needs to understand each other. Basically just a subset of signs which are simplified or otherwise made easy to understand."
Do people in Singapore use ASL or SgSL?
I was taught S.E.E when I was still active in the deaf community years back. I dont know if anything has changed.
"SEE is still in use. SgSL is the locally accepted Sign Language, even if it's not officially recognised yet.Many use the English word order found in SEE and spoken English, but drop words such as ""to"", ""am"", ""is"", ""are"" etc."
"As someone who speaks ASL looking at SgSL I find I've been able to grasp enough. If there is context, one can probably get by. The alphabet and many signs are similar (naturally there are plenty of exceptions).The biggest deviation will always be that signs are agreed upon by the community. Even within ASL depending on which part of the country you are it can already be different, much less across continents and an explicitly declared difference. In many cases though it probably just takes a little explanation at the start and all's good thereafter.The linguists here will kill me for this, but think of it as, you have American English, and you have Singlish. There is enough overlap that both can understand each other. It gets easier if everyone slows down too. There are things which are unique on either side, and if thrown out at random in a conversation you catch no ball for a while but eventually you will get it :)"
"I communicated with an American using S.E.E years back at the deaf association. We could somewhat understand each other.But for the most part, SLs are not mutually intelligible"
"If you go to the US and use SgSL, there's a good chance you will be able to communicate to some extent. Likewise for an American signer who comes to Singapore, if you understand SgSL, you shouldn't find ASL too alienating.While SgSL has some of its roots in ASL, it's since also incorporated local signs such as ""Nasi Lemak"", ""Durian"" and ""Kaypoh"". Like words that are unique to countries, cultures and places, ASL and SgSL are completely different languages."
"Hardly. ASL and S E E are quite different. Example the word “soon” asl sign it using your right hand and pinch 2 finger (thumb and 2nd finger) then touch your chin as if like a wood pecker hitting it. That is “soon” in asl. S E E sign it as left hand up to your chest height, right hand close up into a fist, put both hand together and wave your fist only. Like maneki-neko. That is Soon” for S E E.Totally different."
Now fly around in an F-15E and annoy the residents.
There was a gif/video on the Ace Combat subreddit of someone flying through the spokes of the Singapore Selatapura Flyer.
I finished the campaign and played some Multiplayer. Cant find this though. Help?

I wonder why they removed it?

IANAL but if they reconstructed the models from photos I don't think there's a licensing issue for public buildings in Singapore.
"I initially thought it was just really just video game like rendering spotted irl, then i saw that huge tower at the side"
"Also, how many years does it usually take to progress to a role like a polyclinic gp, and how much does that pay?"
"I have a friend who is working as a GP in a polyclinic and he says his pay is ""crap."" Possibly in the range of $5K+ I guess. But he puts work life balance and raising a family over the paycheck for now."
Ah yeah. That was what i was thinking too
All medical officers earn $4500 - $5000/mth for the first 5 years after housemanship because of the 5 year bond to MOH (if you don't become a registrar in these 5 years).
"ah I see.But if you continue as an MO and don't specialise, how much does the pay increase in later years?Also, if you aren't bonded, how many years does it take to become a GP?"
"But if you continue as an MO and don't specialise, how much does the pay increase in later years?Sorry I'm not sure about this as it seems quite rare for somebody to remain as a medical officer forever after completing their bond. Perhaps pay will increase by $0-100+/year (as before) depending on your performance if you do that. Most people progress to other roles (specialists, resident physicians, family physicians, private GPs) after completing their bond.Also, if you aren't bonded, how many years does it take to become a GP?If you aren't bonded, you can theoretically become a GP immediately after completing housemanship (1 year). In a polyclinic, if you want to progress from being a ""medical officer"" to a ""family physician"", you will either need a Masters of Medicine in Family Medicine or significant years of experience (4-5 years +). More information here."
"Resident physician is the default progression track for a non-specialist in a public hospital setting, I believe."
Open aesthetic clinic>:)
"Just got into basketball and thought I should give the local scene a little support. The tickets are pretty affordable. Anyone has experience with the crowd, ambience and facilities (food?) ?Thinking of going next Sunday."
"went before, bigger crowd than s league lol"
I’ve seen the live coverage of a Slinger match. Definitely more watchable and less amateur compared to Sleague.
I don't think you will get a full stadium but they are pretty good. I would love for more people to start watching their games..
"Been there before as a reporter, although it was the ABL Finals.Atmosphere was great, reminded me of our national football games. Locals and even foreigners were shouting “referee kayu” lol.Can’t comment on the food though because I’ve never tried it. Since the ticket prices are affordable, why not watch a match or two and see if you like it? But good on you for supporting local sports!"
"Went to one game, the atmosphere was good and the food choice is good and they even serve beer! It was definitely fun.The only complaint (and it pissed some people off at the time) was that the organization was terrible - there was a huge queue waiting to enter even after the game had already started. Not sure if it was because of lack of staff or bad organization and not sure if that was a once off or if it's always like that. My advice would be to turn up early just in case!"
"I went to one game like 10 years ago at the Indoor Stadium. If you like basketball, its not the best quality but its not bad either. It was an entertaining evening"
"I went before, it's nice to chill and just watch them play. Big difference between the local players on the team versus the foreign players but than again that's to be expected given size disparity.Local players have improved a lot compared to when they first started and the Slingers was still playing against the Australian teams."
We used to play Ali bomb
How to play
"Under the void deck, we will find a side of a pillar for “Ali” the catcher to defend against the rest of the children.“Ali” has to slap the side of the wall and shout the name of the person he sees to “bomb” (catch) the person. He wins when he manage to catch the majority of the children.The children have to sneak to the wall and put their hands on it without getting caught to be safe."
Just don't play it at the airport. Haha
"Used to have a variation of Ali Bomb where the pillar is replaced by a ball, the children would kick the ball away to free those previously bombed."
Same but it was called stone.
Oh oh and there’s another variation of Void Decks are occupied.We call it “Octopus”The “Octopus” have to defend it’s treasure(Shoes of the children) against the citizens within its den(children).The children have to get back their own shoe without getting caught by the octopus to win.Ah.. dem feels.
Dem feels indeed. My childhood friends and I would play this in a playground with a slide. The slippers would be kept on the landing just up the slide. The additional dimension of height made it that much more dangerous and fun. I miss those days.
"Hahaha i thought its called ""Ali POM!"""
Better not play this game at the airport in this day and age.
“Esther Bomb!”*Everyone runs and screams in panic
damn long since i’ve heard that word haha
We used to make friends with kids staying in the area this way. Kids just randomly joining in and we'd refer to them by the floor their unit was on :')
Exactly!!We’d go around asking “want play catching?”
"Block Catching was the shit. I remember one time when we were running past this one house, my friend's shirt got caught on a bicycle that was next to their door and the family inside came out and started yelling at us because they thought we were trying to steal their bicycle. They started saying they were gonna call the police because we were thieves and asked us for our names and shit, obviously we didn't give them our real names and as soon as I noticed they were distracted, I signaled my friend that It was time to book it and we got the fuck out of there.Good times, I miss being a kid haha."
We used to do block shopping
hello polis
Steal shoes?
"Come, police gor gor treat you to milo ice"
Used to hunt for those quiksilver and billabong flip-flops. Lol
My time was those beng converse sandals/fipflops?
"Oh shit, yes those furry converse flipflops. The colors were great though"
"used to do this so much back then and I just gave it to my friends, whole thing was so dumb looking back"
"I remember the days we did that at a particular block in Yishun with a lady on the 3rd floor selling ice milo pongs (and ice pongs of other flavours as well, but milo was the favourite and sold like hot cakes) and other stuff like curry puffs, samosas, etc. Fucking awesome."
This sounds very familiar. One of the 400+ block in front of North View Primary School?
"Don't remember the exact block, but it's near the former Yishun Primary School site before the merger (now a nursing home, I think), around block 120+."
"hey yo, i used to buy the same ice milo pong too. YPS here."
"*High-fives in Hi-5 logo* Fellow YPS kidsNo idea if the HDB Home-based Small Scale Business Scheme was already implemented back then, many of us thought it was illegal but we still do it so it was like a guilty pleasure for primary and secondary school kids at that time lol"
"Used to play mall catching!! I remember once, my friend and I tried to hide out at the staircase area. Y'know, that part behind the flight of stairs on the first floor. But as we were approaching, we saw people there. We panicked and ran back up immediately. Escaped so quickly that we didn't see anything. Always wondered what they were doing there ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Hahaha good times, good times."
Ice catching at playground all the way till HDB houses + carpark..it was so much FUN!
"Great memories with different variations along the way, the question is do kids still do this or are parents holding a tighter leash that they don’t get to play like this so much"
"I feel like parents are holding a tighter leash. My parents used to just let me go downstairs to play without any adult supervision. Looking back, I'd get into all kinds of dangerous situations with the neighbourhood kids and then go home pretending everything went fine.Now my peers try to ensure an adult is watching their child at ALL times. No chance of them getting into danger."
I'm surprised there was someone with the same childhood experience as me. I thought my parents were too loose on me. They let me run around the neighbourhood as long as I'm back before curfew. That's when the lights at the badminton court goes out.
"I was doing a variation of it in 2010, instead of catching we played with nerf guns. Recollecting bullets was a pain but main was it fun."
"Recollecting bullets was a pain but main was it fun.I'm surprised you were even able to collect the bullets, my kids lost theirs at home shooting up each other."
We were careful. We didn't just spam mindlessly. It was more like a game of cat and mouse as we tried to guess where the other team was.
Then you stumble upon that old man who is always naked at home and all your friends go check it out together
"I use to play “Shark” at the void decks that has those Ping Pong tables. Simple rules: The shark “swims” under the table while everyone else stands/runs on the table. The person whose legs was grabbed by the shark, loses."
"Holy crap, didn't realise this is a common game. We called it crocodile. I once chipped both of my front teeth because the catcher grabbed my ankle just as I was jumping out of his way and I went face down into the edge of the wooden plank. We played it on a row of wooden exercise planks that you would see in parks, so we would jump from plank to plank while the catcher run around and in between the planks to get us. It's pretty amazing how I managed to stay alive throughout childhood. Not even the first time I went head first into something."
"Oh my goodness, used to play crocodile during recess at the sit up benches!!!!Tore my pants leaping from benches to benches..."
"Dude I don't know what we were made of back then but we were indestructible. I mean last time run play block catching for an hour straight no problem. Fuck. Try doing it when you're 20-30, can't even last 15 already wan tou."
"Before there were lifts, there were kids running around & playing catch all over the place. Memories :')"
That cloud shape like a dick
Highlight of one of my childhood birthday parties was 10-20 of us playing virus across different blocks while waiting for the food to be barbequed by the adults. Kids who weren't even invited to the party but were in the area ended up joining us too.
Ah yes whole block catching....fun times and good memories
My classmate played block catching and jumped from 2nd floor. Wtf lol.
Back then we did the stupidest things but glad we survive to tell it
Also glad that there weren't any smartphones to document every single shenanigan
"Ahhh, back in those days, when you only had yourself, other people and the environment as your playground. :D"
Carpark catching too
Car park catching too until residents call police and we kena spotcheck :/
"My neighbours' kids play around the block with their nerf guns. They would skulk around the corridors, stairways and lifts trying to catch one another off guard, it looks pretty fun."
I remember playing carpark catching also lol. Good old days
I used to play ice and water around hdb blocks with only one rule.No climbing beyond the second levelThat taught me parkour to leap off second floors to get away from the catchers and save the frozen.
We also played Red Indian. We stacked our slippers up and take turns to throw a ball at it. The one who hit the slippers down becomes the catcher. He's then supposed to throw the ball at someone to eliminate the rest while they try to stack them up again. The catcher wins if he hits everyone and the rest wins if they managed to stack them up.
"Interesting. My version was called build house - 4 slippers to form a house, and instead of a ball, we used a 5th slipper to knock the house down and throw at the rest."
We had a luxury of a ball as we frequently carry a tennis ball around in case we wanted to play Rounders at the badminton court.
These aren't normal flats... These are dungeons
legalise airsoft and this would be a haven
ya but residents always call police :(
"We had this and volleyball court catching. The catcher has the whole court. The runners can only run along the line(don't have to actually follow the line all the way, but your legs should generally straddle both sides). ""House"" was at the umpire's chair, but only one person at a time allowed to take a break."
Had a rich relative whose family owned a hotel. Hotel catching is much better than Hdb block catching you plebsss
Dats some next level play right here
Fun Fact: The identity behind the Bumblebee is actually a Malay lady in her 20s. Managed to saw her un-suit when she ended her work late at night.
So it’s actually Bumble Bte Bee

faith in humanity really low at the moment because as I was walking towards a bus stop today I witnessed a bus stop full of 10+ people ignoring a blind man asking for help :/ I went up to help him and brought him to where he wanted to go but along the way I just kept seeing people giving him stares because he was talking louder than the usual volume in a mall (I mean he can't see to gauge people's responses right of course he's gonna talk as loudly as he wants to). Just bums and pisses me off that people are so unkind.

"Dont worry fam, it will be over all too soon, stay strong"
"How do people deal with their Boyfriend/girlfriend’s parents not liking them? I haven’t exactly met my boyfriend’s parents yet, but I have a feeling they might not like me. They are very strict for his age - he’s 23, and they will track his location on Find my friends and constantly ask about his whereabouts and who he’s with whenever he goes out. He has been hanging out with me till a little later recently, and I think they’ve attributed that to me being a bad influence."
"Not much you can do about them, and it's a huge deal breaker from experience because parents are a tremendous factor in making relationships work, and continue to be so even past marriage when they take care of your kids for you. If you have started off on their wrong foot, the relationship is going to be stressful.If they feel he is not ready for a relationship, the only way is for him to gradually change their minds, and he needs to show that he is ready for more responsibilities without sacrifice to studies or whatever primary responsibilities he now has. They are not going to listen to you on why you aren't really a bad influence at all, and there is really nothing you can do."
"I think they do feel that he’s ready for a relationship - just not with someone like me perhaps? They are perfectly fine with his younger brother’s girlfriend, a nice sweet local u Christian girl. I’m not christian, I drink and I club (albeit less now), and am working full time (no degree)."
"Since you've not met them, their attitude is likely from assumptions based on what your bf has told them and observed changes to his lifestyle and schedule. I think your bf has to clarify with his parents on their real feelings about you, why they would disapprove of him being with you, and if there is anything that the both of you do that could change their minds. Feels like there's still some lack of clarity on the problem and it's impossible to reach a resolution until there are more answers."

Good luck till May man. I know most ppl don’t agree with it; but find comfort in death. Maybe makes life worth living and you know you have an option.

Why is it so hard to sleep
Lie on your bed with your hands behind your head. Think about floating in the middle of the ocean of drifting in space. Imagine that beyond your room is a world of mystery and wonders.
Did somebody discard your chou chou too?
Never had one. Maybe it time to build one
"Haha, it’s quite unhygienic ><. I recommend chamomile tea and 15 mins of no device time (starts now for me)."
Ok good night. Somehow looking at your nick I feel I need waffle to goes along with it too...

Spilt water on my MacBook and now it’s dead :( Anyone knows the estimated cost for water damage repairs?
Oh no. Have you tried placing it in a box of rice for a few days?
"Don’t have rice with me now, although I have my mac turned over and I’m planning to leave it there for a hike and hope for the best"

Yeah :(
Alighted the train in the north and got greeted by haze :(
My nose is useless so I don't even know if I'm breathing in all that haze :(. I'd probably only know when there's actual particles floating around.
Such is life =(

"THIS IS SO CUTE , now i wanna go stargazing"
came home and realised my chou chou gone alr.hard to sleep with this new pillow omt
The beginnings of a new chou chou
TT_TT So hard to fall asleep
"1, 2, 3... whoosh. A spell is cast. May you have sweet chou chou dreams."
Anyone else seeing the ad on TV about the guy thanking his parents for beinf the worst parents in the world at his wedding then explaining why they are actually the best? I don't get the point why he said they were the worst in the first place
"that’s just a short version of the ad, although i gotta admit it irritates me whenever i see it on tv"
The ad by income.sg? I think it is meant to set a contrast against what ppl see vs what he rly see in his parents
"He called them the worst parents in the world, why couldnt they be like other parents, because he had an amazing childhood. So he was implying that the rest of Singaporeans didnt have an amazing childhood? Thats just my take on it. Very odd claim there"
"I kinda saw it differently. He was doing a comparison between his childhood and other singaporeans who were better off financially. From a glance, you could tell he was blaming his parents for not providing well enough for him. It even caused some discomfort among his audience. But afterwards, he clarified that his parents gave him an amazing childhood, just with what they have, because they spent time planning for their son's future. That is where the beauty of the message lies - To be content with what we have and start planning for the future. Well truth be told, it is an advertisement. So having the ""Worst Parents in the World"" will definitely trigger people to find out why haha. I still thoroughly enjoy it though :)"
"Ah, your explanation was much better. I agree with you."
Teachers are so underappreciate and underpaid They spent a substantial amount of time planing their lesson / markingAny free time left would be used to attend meeting helping weaker students etc etcSure at a certain stage of their career they are paid decently but their starting pay is just pathetichow many of them gets burnout before they reached that point of their career Passion just doesn't do justice for the workload they are put through
"quite sure that's not the case lor, entry level teachers can earn up to 4k while teachers that are in hod can cap at 15k/month"
Oh boy you're definitely misinformed.
"rly, enlighten me haha"

"Hi!I grind my teeth too! I didn't even know about it until my friend pointed it out to me one day when he heard some ""mechanical noise"" while I'm sleeping.Tbh, I know it's probably due to stress but to this date, I've no idea on what to do to stop it. Stress to me is ... not just pinpoint to one thing only?I think the most practical solution will be to tell him the long term effect of teeth grinding, which is horrible since you only have one set, and tell him to wear a mouth guard.Obstructed nasal passageway can also cause the mouth to move unnecessarily. See if he can breathe properly through his nose."
Teeth grinding is due to stress usuallyMaybe he’s particularly stressed during this time period?
"dw just tell him straight lol, it's not a big deal most people don't even know they are grinding their teeth. theres no need to be subtle about itfor me personally, during A levels period i was grinding my teeth like fuck and i didn't even know till my mom told me one day"
"Since it is a recent development, it definitely could be the caffeine causing it. Sometimes stress or anxiety during the day can contribute. Also avoid chewing gums and try to relax before going to bed."
"Any good k-drama to recommend? I watched signal,tunnel and stranger."
"Life on Mars, Voice1 and 2. I think you'll probably like them ..."
"Finished 'sky castle' in 2 days! Really good drama, no wonder it has the highest ratings ever. I'm watching 'beauty inside' now on Netflix"
"Don't watch much but I enjoyed while you were sleeping, oh my ghost and weightlifting fairy! Can give them a try"
I really liked encounter. A poetic kdrama :')
Healer
"Misaeng, Life, Kingdom"
"I recommend voice! Based on the ones that you watched, Voice is also a crime solving drama. And Black also!"
"Voice (1 and 2), The Defendant, Misaeng, Prison Playbook are really good. If you're into supernatural / horror, OCN is really into producing this genre recently - The Guest and Priest. Romance - can try Strong Woman Do Bong Soon, one of the better rom coms out there."
I thought Sky Castle was gonna be lame. But it got intense and kinda relatable very fast.
"Wanna check with those in BMTC now, are route marches done using 5 or 10 pack now?"
lol I heard it was 5 too. I ain't in bmt tho so I'm curious too.
"Wait, 5 pack as in half of the original 10-pack load?"
"My batch last year was 5, some friends say it's 10 now but no friends in BMT now"

Mac Ritchie nature walk + Adam road food after + botanic gardens to end it off
"Nice, nice. Haven’t been to the macritchie walk. Best smrt stop? Caldecott? Marymount?"
"If you exit from Marymount MRT, cross the road to where the fire station is and walk along Marymount Road, there's an underpass that leads to MacRitchie"
"You caught me there, I usually go by car. I’d say Marymount and then a quick bus (5-10 min tops). It’s called Mcritchie tree top walk, check out instagram for photos!"
I find it amusing how I was sick for the past few days (and spent the majority of today in bed cause I felt so bad) then all of a sudden my sickness is gone in the span of 1-2 hours. And it's not like I just took my meds too.Here's hoping I don't jinx myself and wake up sick tomorrow (which happened the past few days)
Sleep helps
"I wasn't even sleeping, just sitting up staring into space. When i did try to sleep my temperature stagnants or gets higher"
all those delicious foods and drinks are high calories:(hk bao luo bao milk tea bubble tea with pearls any chocolates chips any nuts ice cream bao dim sum cookies ya kun bread any hawker food (except fish soup?) soft drinks hawker center kopi and teh (those with milk and coffee) 😭😭😭i think my problem lies in loving unhealthy foods but yet i wanna maintain an ideal weight. its a constant feeling of overthinking these delicious foods and maintaining the discipline to control my cravings.😢😭😪😪
Make them a reward then
Anyone smell haze?
Yep! Got it over here in the east.
Yes ugh... I’m in east
North west also have :(
Any idea where to buy a cheap tea strainer?

Maybe a stupid thing to ask but I'm trying to find out how SingPost collects the GST when I import something over S$400. I understand they will collect the payment upon delivery. Is this cash only or can I pay with something else? Would be nice to know this up front because I don't use a lot of cash. in general and I'm unable to find in on the SingPost website. Thanks all and have a great week ahead!!
It happened to me before. They'd send you a letter saying you need to pay $XX GST and you need to go somewhere (forgot where it is) to make payment (CASH / NETS I think) and they'd hand you your package.
Makes sense! I guess this is the post office so I should be able to pay there with card. Thank you!

I don't know how to smile in photos. It is time to learn. Ruining the family photographs.
You made me try smiling in different ways after reading this
Ahaha :D :O :) XDBut this is me:>:|
"Dont frown too much, will get wrinkles XD actually laugh lines also no better hmmm"
"Yep. I think if you practice for a few hours, that's all it will take to look good in every staged photo ever again. So many ugly people looking amazing in pics... You can be one of us!"
I dislike looking at the mirror at myself hahaha. I'll give it a go. First time I looked up how to smile for photos. I have 7 6 days to practice before the next family photo for occasion.
Post photo here and we help you heheheheh
Cannot lol. Someone said I look intimidating after I showed the family photo.
Maybe you're just really good looking don't think too much lah.
"What's wrong with looking intimidating? Some women dig the strong, silent type what. XD XD XD"
Uh.. I guess I am the silent type -burn-
"looking for people to play league with, except its ap duo poke bot lane, well the main point is to play pokechamps like crazy. i even went 3 man bot, or 2 ap sp and 1 adc."

Yeah it is. Climbing is too hard when nearly everyone doesnt want to learn macro and just want to fight

"1st time running around bedok reservoir at night, was pretty lit. No paranomal activityEdit: Hit with burnt smell in the east again, Johor or factories?"
Burnt smell rn at 2am jeez i can smell it even with the aircon on
you ran on the inner path or outer path?
"Both, burnt smell wasn't in bedok"
"both...? wow, that’s a really long run then.haha, i wanted to recommend running on the outer path but i guess you already found it"
Oh! Running on the outer path is better?
less sand. you do have to run upslope but the downslope is pretty dope.

"Fifty thousand on my head, it’s disrespect"
"True. I once thought some people were likely assholes from the way they smiled but thought i shouldnt judge them based on that. I was right in the sense that they werent assholes, but utter jerks."
"Yeah, it just goes to show how those morals and ethics shit issnt relevant these days. The ironic thing is i actually emphatise self centred people more as i grow older and those who actually judge people"
Dafuq you guys sound like edgy 15 year olds
I wish i thought that way when i was 15

"Soooo what does long black slacks, plain white t-shirt, track shoes and unkempt hair mean?"
"Ok more info, I rarely use a bag, even if i do I only use a black laptop bag. Surgical masks is a must unless friends are present and I rarely am seen having a phone case on my phone. I'm like as skinny as one can possibly get so all my shirts are slightly oversized. Pants are normal though."
you mean obviously this is not 100% accurate..?
"Recently im thinking of getting a chair with good ergonomic design considering the amount of sitting I do in a day. So did a couple of google searches and most of the chairs are out of my budget ($130 at most) and found out 'Amazon Basic Essentials Swivel Mid Back Mesh Task' is cheap at roughly 60 SGD and inside the list of good chairs, anyone used it before or has another budget recommendation within my budget? Love to hear your feedbacks!"
"Does that include shipping? Ikea Flintan $80 (less if you can find a display model) is pretty decent. Auto-locking castors and looks more solid than the Amazon one. Can't see clearly from the pics but Amazon legs seems to be a matte finish different from the middle cylinder, suggesting it might be plastic. Ikea one is steel legs. plus Ikea stuff has 10 yr guarantee"
"Ikea Flintan actually looks good, hmmm might go down for a test. Good recommend!"
I got my chair for $60 at IKEA. Feels great. IKEA Chairs are great.
I really have to take a trip down in this case
2nd hand ikea chair on carousell and sit on the chair and row yourself home

"First thing that came to mind was Singtel's anti-competition stance in 2015:""We don't believe there's a need for a fourth operator,"" Chua Sock Koong, chief executive officer of Singapore's biggest phone company, said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Thursday. ""Even without a fourth operator, consumers in Singapore are already spoilt for choice,"" she added, pointing to the level of pricing and service among existing carriers.– Quote from this article.This quote hasn't aged well. I've got such a poor impression of Ms Chua, doesn't seem like a very ethical lady.Edit: Fixed broken link."
already spoilt for choiceFuck you Singtel. I'd take my business to the others even if theirs are a small 50 cents more.
"Singtel plans data are still 2,3 GB. Trying so hard to earn money from data add ones."
"I don't think the telcos are losing much from this war since wifi is available virtually everywhere now (eg. MRT station, shopping malls, restaurants, shops, schools, workplace, etc). They are counting on the fact that most people don't use that much data.Unless you're like a stay in NSF or work at some place with no wifi, whether the limit is 15gb or 50gb usually makes no difference.Perhaps the biggest loss for the companies are from people who had expensive high data plan who downgraded?"
"Just a reminder that public wifi is a bad idea, security wise. If you really have to use public wifi, use it in conjunction with a reputable VPN."
are there any ways to secure yourself if you cannot afford a VPN?
Don’t use the wifi! Honest simple truth.
too true. While you here come subscribe to additional data packages.
Well lucky for them I don't have unlimited (basically my phone can't access public WiFi (my school one also) about all the time
I remember back then when carriers switched from selling 3G plans to 4G plans the data available went from 12GB to 3-4GB. But the new cap applied on regardless on whether you were using 3G or 4G.But now with MVNOs like circles life and myrepublic I don't think they can pull off a similar stunt but they may keep their networks exclusive to their own subscribers for the first 9 months or so although it's unlikely that such a arrangement would be in place because they can get a faster return on investment if they generate lesser income from much more users.
"Meanwhile, M1's full-year results showed that the share of tiered data plan customers who bust their primary data caps hovered around the one-third mark each quarterRemember how we were told average person don't use more than 2gb."
"Might be true, might be not.Might also be a result of people consciously saving data.I am used to having a old 2GB plan from the days before 4G.Even after upgrading to the more current 6GB plan about 3 years ago, I still rarely use more than 2GB a month.Now that I have gotten TPG's free unlimited data trial SIM as my SIM2 on my dual-sim phone, I watched ~4GB worth of Netflix, 2GB of Youtube, and download app updates on the commute like it was nothing, and that's just this month.I'm pretty sure that if everyone had unlimited data (even if throttled), the usage will be WAY higher."
That 2gb statement was made during the period where they reduced 12gb to 2gb.
Yay for competition I guess
As a customer:Yay for competition I guess
"Fantastic if we didn't have this type of foreign competitor , our telcos would stay with their plans forever Sia. My mum literally had the same plan for the past 5 years+..... Finally some progress. I swear most things in Singapore liddat . Things no progress until got some sort competition or someone stirs shit."
With 5G they do not need to worry about the bandwidth unlike 4G.
table serving food thing (god my phrasing) has been around since last year? Or 2 years?Mini cones tho I've never seen it before
Table service...
yes..
r/wildbeef
"Oh yeah, they gave mini cones out at the Raffles City Macs one time. I was actually very flustered because I left my kids at the table and went to order the food, then when I went back to the table with the food, the kids told me that they were given free ice cream. Finished eating already. Worried the crap out of me, like some stranger trying to trick/poison them or what? Luckily the Macs staff came round again, and they even had a guy dressed as Ronald Mcdonald.Regarding table service, I noticed that some of the ordering machines have this option. There’s a numbered placard that you can take and associate with your order."
That's nice of them
so wholesome
"It's part of a rebranding process that started around 2015 iirc. Attended a talk and they were talking about this. After that, noticed that products like salads, ""hand crafted"" beverages, premium burgers started to go on the list.I think we can assume that they will be doing services that are not centered around the the good old fast food next."
wow the mini cones was something from back in the 90s. i remember it as a kid...
i haven’t gone to mcdonald’s in a month and i was surprised to see this. also is it for a limited time only?
i have never seen mini cones but i have seen mini starbucks before :)edit: it was given out as free samples
"It's part of a rebranding process that started around 2015 iirc. Attended a talk and they were talking about this.

I was served with that at hougang one too! Its cute:)
"I think the serving thing has been around for more than 10 years bc I rmb as a kid they would, but back then it was only for orders that they couldn't do on time-ish. Like if you ordered 3 burgers and and they only had stock for 1 then you could go to your table and they'll bring it to you, like what Carl's Jr does."
"I think this one is more for ‘deliberate’ table service, not those that they couldn’t finish on time HAHAH"
I've seen Mac giving out mini ice cream cones to children bfr but it's only like what once in a blue moon ? Haha
I got a free mini frappe from the store manager from the Blk744 Bedok Reservoir Road macs once while dining in. That particular restaurant also had table service
They're slowly rolling out full table service to selected restaurants. It's already available in many locations overseas including the US and India.
Woah it's like petrol kiosks in the 90s
Awh.As a tiny kid (like 7 or so?) I got a free mini cone from a McD's server cause kid me was apparently very polite to the staff.I still treat servers with respect but I ain't seen one of these cones since then.
Did you know that the soft serve cone you get from ARC drive through tastes better than any other drive through?
Explains the price hike. Need to finance from somewhere right..
Maybe they trying to clear off the remaining vanilla ice cream stock??
"SINGAPORE - The Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) on Saturday (Feb 23) launched its election campaign, in anticipation of a general election taking place by the end of this year.At the launch event, party leaders including secretary-general Chee Soon Juan and chairman Paul Tambyah laid out the party's plans for the rest of 2019. These include the release of policy papers on topics such as housing and the cost of living, as well as a planned pre-election rally at Hong Lim Park in September.Dr Chee said the SDP plans to contest the same areas as it did in the 2015 election, and recruit between 300 to 500 volunteers to help with groundwork.The party had previously fielded 11 candidates to contest in Holland-Bukit Timah and Marsiling-Yew Tee GRCs, as well as Bukit Batok, Bukit Panjang and Yuhua SMCs, but failed to win a seat.The SDP is the first political party to launch its campaign for the next general election, which must be held by April 2021. There has been speculation over whether the election will be called this year.Addressing an audience of about 200 at the Mandarin Orchard Hotel, Dr Chee pointed to the importance of an early start.""It's important for us because we don't know when the elections are going to be held,"" he said. ""By the time they are called, it's going to be too late. So we are starting early.""In his speech, Professor Tambyah highlighted issues such as rising inequality, cost of living and recent lapses in government institutions, which he said have not been adequately addressed.""What I am concerned about is that no one takes responsibility or ownership of these disasters,"" Prof Tambyah said of the lapses. ""The blame always seems to fall on a low-ranked individual, rather than on a system or culture that does not encourage critical thinking.""Other speakers included party vice-chairman John Tan, treasurer Bryan Lim, assistant treasurer Wong Souk Yee, and central executive committee members Damanhuri Abas and Khung Wai Yeen. They elaborated on the party's plans for the year and appealed for donations and more volunteers.Asked if he would do anything differently for the next general election, Dr Chee said the SDP would intensify its groundwork and make it more extensive.The SDP had initiated a meeting between several opposition parties last year to discuss the possibility of forming an opposition coalition led by former PAP MP Tan Cheng Bock. Dr Tan had formally applied to register a new political party in January.On Saturday, Dr Chee reiterated the call for greater coordination amongst opposition parties, saying: ""We can't guarantee that we will get there in the months to come, but the important thing is that we need to get the initiative going.""He added: ""As far as the Workers' Party is concerned, we continue to encourage all opposition parties to come together and we do what we can to facilitate it. Whatever comes of that, it is beyond our control.""He was also asked if the party would run out of steam if elections are held later than he expects, to which he replied: ""If that was the case, we would have lost steam by now.""The SDP campaign launch was originally planned for a venue in Eunos.But the party was informed at noon on Friday (Feb 22) that its booking had been cancelled as political events were not allowed there, even though the nature of the event had been made clear from the start, Prof Tambyah said.The SDP said on its website that a ""JTC inspection"" was one of the reasons cited for the cancellation of its original booking.Responding in a Facebook post on Saturday, the JTC Corporation said it had ""no prior knowledge"" of the event.It added that it had previously informed the venue owner that it would be inspecting the premises as part of ongoing investigations into unauthorised subletting activities which started last December.""The decision to cancel the rental of the premises to SDP was made by the venue owner, without JTC's knowledge or involvement,"" JTC said.""It is totally irresponsible to conflate this issue with the on-going investigations, and allege political motives on the part of JTC.""Among those who attended Saturday's campaign launch was former Democratic Progressive Party chief Benjamin Pwee, who has applied to join the SDP.The SDP's central executive committee is expected to meet early next month to go through his application."
They chopping places to tell the other parties to f off haha
"Good luck in convincing elderly, SAF regulars or well-off voters to vote for you SDP.All PAP has to do is to raise Chee's character, his spat with Chiam, or ""unrealistic"" policies like ""tax and spend"" or defense budget cuts.Predicted number of seats won or seats with more than 40%.. zeroSwing voters do not want a real alternative to PAP because the PAP model while imperfect sort of works for Singapore. They want a PAP lite opposition which is what WP, Chiam See Tong or Tan Cheng Bock represents"
"SAF regularsUnless the PAP is found to be siphoning cash in an 1MDB like case, I think you'd be hard pressed to convince SAF regulars to bite the hand that feeds. It's not about SDP but our party co-opt tradition."
"Honestly, SDP could probably do better with letting Chee go. It's nothing to do with his policies, but whatever goodwill he might have with the average Singaporean has probably been catapulted out the window. They could also do with taking some time to garner some support from the ground and getting in touch with the people rather than just countering everything the PAP says. It sometimes stinks of opposing for the sake of opposing, and that never sits well with anyone."
They can’t. Because Chee has become too closely linked to the party identity.
Sounds like a cult of personality when you put it that way.
"Absolutely right. Paul Tambyah should take over the leadership for the SDP, but CSJ being the egoistical man that he is, will never allow that."
"Okay. Their leaders are known for being bad at ""playing the game"" when it comes to elections and getting votes, wonder how they'll do this time."
What a sausage fest.
Not really into politics but would love to learn more. Is there a Phllip D Singapore edition i can sub to?

"Should be interesting if (from a linguistic perspective) the message gets transcribed as-is in all 5 languages. When visiting some areas in China featuring heavy Japanese presence in the past the Japanese text was very much made neutral - and the Chinese text was basically slamming the Japanese, no holding back lmao."
"Chinese text was basically slamming the Japanese, no holding back lmao.I am extremely interested in what is the Chinese and Japanese words used and how exactly they slammed the Japanese. Knowing the history of the Chinese Language, it's bound to be very flowery."
"I don't currently have photos with me. so you'll have to take my word for it, but the Japanese text was v matter-of-fact, i.e. the X Army moved into YYY location at ZZZZ date, establishing a foothold into mainland China. The Chinese text was more emotive, i.e. the Japanese displayed inhumane cruelty as the X Army advanced into YYY location, heralding an era of shame for the Chinese... and so on.Examples given not exact, since its been a few years now - text only to show differences."
When the Japanese don't want to teach their own history so other countries have to do it for them.
...and japanese
"I visited the Nanjing Massacre Memorial (in Nanjing, in case that wasn't obvious). Every exhibit is labelled in 3 languages - English, Mandarin, and Japanese.All the exhibits, excoriating the atrocities of the Japanese in sometimes quite florid language, in Japanese. I think it was clear that they intended to send a message to any Japanese who happened to visit."
"If you read the ST article and the CNA article about the signs, this was exactly the original intention for the war memorials too. Tagging u/totallyagenius too.This comes after former foreign minister George Yeo highlighted how the historic site marker for the Sook Ching massacre in Changi Beach previously carried information in the five languages but was replaced by a plaque that is in only English.And:The original monument ""deliberately"" had Singapore's four official languages and Japanese at the bottom, said Mr Yeo, ""because it is important for the Japanese to know this history too""."
"I visited the place in Nanjing too. Note that the Chinese gov inflates the figures to stir anti-japanese sentiment.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_toll_of_the_Nanjing_MassacreToday many mainstream historians concur that this estimate is exaggerated.She found that Chinese historians favor estimates between 40,000 and 150,000 and that they ""speculated that reducing the official Chinese estimate of victims would pave the way for greater reconciliation between Japan and China"". However, they feared that speaking out openly ""would be detrimental to their careers."""
"Nanjing is just one of the many battles and a total of 10-25 million Chinese civilian died in the war.I don't think debating whether it's 40,000 or 300,000 amounts to stirring anti-Japanese sentiment and more reflective on Japan's attitude if anything, especially when 300k is just a rounding error compared to 10-25 million."
"Death toll of the Nanjing MassacreThe total death toll of the Nanjing Massacre is a highly contentious subject in Chinese and Japanese historiography. Following the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese Imperial Army marched from Shanghai to the Chinese capital city of Nanking, and though a large number of Chinese POWs and civilians were slaughtered by the Japanese following their entrance into Nanking on December 13, 1937, the precise number remains unknown. Since the late-1960s when the first academic works on the Nanking Massacre were produced, estimating the approximate death toll of the massacre has been a major topic of scholarly debate.A wide range of numbers have been proposed by historians but, in addition to differing interpretations of the evidence, there have been persistent difficulties in defining the scope of the massacre and determining who among the dead to include as ""massacre victims"".[ ^PM | Exclude ^me | Exclude from ^subreddit | FAQ / ^Information | ^Source ] Downvote to remove | v0.28"

"For any Japanese visitor, they were already the enlightened ones."
Can't be helping them whitewash history now can we?
"Well... the Japanese themselves apparently don't really educate their people on what they did during WW2... especially in Asia. I has a Japanese exchange student as a friend and he told me that when he visited one of the exhibits ( don't really remember which one ) that educates about Japanese aggression during WW2, he was really surprised about what they did. He told me they were only taught abit about the Pearl Harbour attack and thats all... Its good for them to send a message to the Japanese tourists about what their country did but I still feel its up to Japan to educate their citizens properly. If I were a tourist and saw these stuff it would probably ruin my holiday by a little ? Idk"
True story. I have a friend whose Japanese gf was also clueless about Japanese aggression and occupation during WW2. Took her to visit some of the war memorials in Singapore and she cried.
"I used to work in the Singapore branch of a Japanese software company, my team manager is a Japanese who came over with his family from the HQ to lead the team. Once he asked me about Total Defence Day when his kids received a letter from their school about the school commemorating this day, so I told him about how the British surrendered to the Japanese on this day in 1942 during World War II, and the lessons we should learn from the war. I quote him, verbatim:But we drove out the British colony, that's a good thing right?I can't remember how the rest of the history lesson went, but this is when I could finally 100% believe all the articles about the lack of education about WWII during history lessons in Japan."
"Like the many lives they ruined over the Occupation?I like Japanese pop culture as much as the next weeaboo, but if their government is gonna play the denial game, too bad if their holiday is spoiled because they’re gonna hear the facts from me."
I brought a Japanese exchange student around last year and we got to the wartime exhibit in the National Museum. He didn't seem all that surprised about it and said he'd been taught about it before.
"It's only a very vocal minority that choose to feign ignorance or twist facts (mostly, but not limited to the older generation), and this behaviour is not unique to Japan as many would've guessed.While it's true that many older textbooks frequently twist or hide certain parts of the story to whitewash a country's bloody history, few modern textbooks would do so these days and if they do, they are subject to major controversies. An example being a rather recent textbook that downplayed Japan's nefarious actions during the war, springing a huge controversy not only in China and Korea but also within Japan itself, resulting in most Japanese schools criticising it and avoiding its usage. The fact that there were heavy criticisms shows that they're not as clueless about their own history as you think they are."
Proof that wealth and some polite customs do not make a civilisation noble.

I will be staying at a hotel near those two food centers (Lau Pa Sat/Maxwell Court). Any recommendations on what to get and avoid? It will be my first time in Singapore. Do any of those places accept cash?I'm excited and would love some tips.
"Maxwell is better than LPS but you can try both. LPS is mostly serving tourists these days. Cash is accepted, $4-9 is about right (now wait for people to tell you how less tourist friendly places have meals for $2.50!).Amoy St food centre is nearby and worth a try too. Authentic Thai and Good Day (beef noodles) are 2 good stalls there on the first floor."
Thank you for the suggestions.I will check out Maxwell and Amoy street. Do most stalls accept credit card or Google Pay?
Most stalls only accept cash.
Lau Pa Sat is a tourist trap.Btw /u/therivera I highly recommend checking out Mike Chen's food tour.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5Fml0pyLbI
"You're pretty much in the midst of food central. Don't restrict yourself to these two food centres. Forget about Maxwell except perhaps if you want to experience street-side satay (barbecued meat on a stick, Malay origin), which opens only at night.Maxwell is known for the chicken rice (you'll see where the long lines are).Just across the road from Maxwell is Chinatown, where there're not one but two food centres.Further down the road is Tanjong Pagar, another food centre.Don't miss the multitude of restaurants along Tras Street.You can also explore the 100AM mall nearby, which is known for its high concentration of everything Japanese.And Amoy street food centre, which others have mentioned, a magnet during office hours for the working crowd looking for good and cheap local fare."
"how much cash should I carry? Since I am visiting, I plan to eat at the hawker centers for breakfast, lunch and dinner."
A simple meal (with drinks) at those mentioned food centres shouldn't exceed more than $10.
USD or SGD?
SGD!
Thank you.
Chinatown People’s Park is a much more exciting experience.Ri Ri Hong fragrant hot pot Roast Pork galore Dumplings steamed and fried Noodles noodles noodlesI can barely control myself.
Maxwell is much more authentic.Xing Xing kueh (local sweets) highly recommended.
"Xing Xing kueh (local sweets) highly recommended.What food do you recommend to try? Right now, I'm rely on the heuristic of long lines at stalls being good places to try."
Kueh kosui and ondeh ondeh
"When it comes to food places, cash is king. It may seem a little unhygienic to handle cash and food, but usually whoever is handling food doesn't handle cash, or at the minimum, they should be taking off food prep gloves before touching the cash, then put them on again before touching food. Then again, cashless payments are still in their infancy(sometimes takes a while to process, potential for cheating is easier etc), and the charges cut into already wafer-thin margins, so can't really blame them."
Makes sense. Appreciate the response.
Avoid all of the food in any hawker centre. It's all low quality disgusting crap where the only discernable flavour is salt.
"Just wondered what snacks, crisps and sweets people like the best from overseas, especially US, UK and Australia.Got a big hankering for salt and vinegar Walkers crisps, can never find those anywhere here. :("
In Japan now. Going to miss 7-11 and Lawson's egg sandwich.
I miss the croquette the most.
I’d say I miss 90% of Lawson/FamilyMart. 7/11 in Singapore is miserable copy of it in Japan
FamilyMart is the shit. I love their house brand milk pudding. Can't get anything similar here without paying through the nose
"Well, to each his own. I prefer FM over 7/11"
But he's saying he likes FM?
Dude... 7 eleven has the best egg sandwiches. And coffee too.IMO Lawson has the worst sandwiches out of the 3 chains. They even leave the crust on. The ikura onigiri is bomb though and the oden!
In Japan now. Any coffee recommendatikns?

mister donut. maybe not considered as snack
"Kraft Handi Snacks. Apparently someone once posted that he/she found some at ntuc but despite people asking which branch, the OP never replied so I took it as a troll."
Hey there! Not the OP of the other post but I found them at the Fairprice Finest at Serangoon Gardens!
Thank you ! I tried checking multiple Fairprice Finest branches but couldn't find them. Will try this one !
There is! Maybe it's not your luck to have them it stock. Another place is cold storage @ taka.

They stopped stocking it alr

Check the more atas Cold Storages and Honestbee. They sometimes have Walkers S&V in stock. Good luck!
"The drink Irn Bru.Stains my teeth orange, but damn does it go well with fish and chips"
Seen it in Cold Storage - as a Scot visiting Singapore I was delighted to see it was the higher sugar version than available back home.
Most cold storage have it
The one in Bugis has the small and large bottles.
Meidi Ya also have. Got Diet version also.

Fairprice warehouse club had the jumbo box on clearance few weeks ago! Maybe try your luck there.
Thanks for the info
"Seen Walkers chips more than few times in Singapore at shopping center event pop ups, some British pubs also had them before.Can find almost anything here if you willing to pay 3x the own country retail price."
Jawbreaker. Especially gobstopper
"I remember NTUC and other supermarkets carrying Willy wonka gobstoppers when I was a kid, both the colour-changing and everlasting ones, if those are the kind you're looking for"
Yeah. The everlasting and chewy. Those were the times. Until stupid NTUC took it all away
IIRC I saw some Gobstoppers at Candylicious at Sentosa a while ago when I visited.Also I really like the word gobstoppers when the Arctic Monkeys used it in one of their songs.
Haha sorry. Do not know who the artic monkeys were. But the gobstoppers at candylicious are 2x more expensive then they should be. Am a poor guy can't afford
Try candy empire. Usually cheaper
Where else other than Vivo can you find candy empire
B2 313 Somerset? Not sure if it's still there though
Musk stick
Canadian Maple Syrup Cream Cookies are amazing. I accidentally ate a whole box of them before finding out that I can't get more in Singapore. =\
I’ve bought those from Warehouse Club several times.

Came here to write poffertjes. Tiny pancakes with butter and powdered sugar...Singaporeans would love it if it was sold here. Stroopwafels can get from starbucks. They sell 2 a pack at the counter.
"Cool, I will check it out!"
"German Market or Candy Empire (to a lesser extent) if you like to get stroopwafels. As for poffertjes, I know of a night market stall that sells them (original + other variations of it)."
I heard of the stall before! Thanks!
"Stroopwaffles have ah. Candy Empire have, some Cold Storage also."
Thanks!
You can get pepparkakor at Ikea! Not sure if year-round but they definitely sell tins during the festive season. Goes great with some hot coffee/tea

Birthday Cake Oreos from the USA
"I remember AMK Hub NTUC used to carry them. They were okay, i really couldnt taste the diff between the normal and bday cake"
"Oreos by nabisco, not kraft. There are so many limited edition flavours in the US like red velvet, mint and smores etc which all sound super good.Meanwhile in SG we have “mildly sweet” oreos. like why would you even???"

Pop tarts. That's the bomb.
Many varieties available at cold storage isn't it
Is it? I never saw any. Perhaps the cold storage at my place doesn't have them
Cloyingly sweet.
Best if microwaved
It's blasphemy if you don't microwave them.
"Fairprice also has it. Fairprice xtra at ang mo kio confirm have. Under cereals section. Fudge brownie, cookies & cream were there if I recall correctly."
There’s poptarts in Cold Storage and I think in those atas groceries like Jasons.
Overpopulation always lead to suppression of wages and inflated prices due to increased demand. :(
"Inflation rates are generally measured using the consumer price index in Singapore. However, only a common basket of goods are selected to be in the consumer price index. As some goods and services have volatile prices (eg oil prices, food prices; bad/good harvest?), including them in the common basket of goods will be problematic to calculate the true value of inflation.In the case of this article, they seem to be referring to MAS' core inflation which seems to mostly include the price of accommodation in Singapore (please correct me if I'm wrong because I can't seem to find much information about what other goods and services are included in the core inflation).EDIT 1: That is why the article claims that there might be an ""affordability crisis"" in Singapore since core inflation does not reflect the true value of the increasing cost of living in Singapore"
Core does not include food and energy and is more representative of the long run trend
"price of food almost doubled over the last decade, yet wages remains pretty stagnant.... this is worrisome"
All I know is that deliveroo price increase from $10 to $12 to $16. Sushi at the supermarket went up from $8.5 to like $10. 1 egg in camp canteen increase price by 10 cents.
And dbl cheeseburger meal went up from $5 to $6.10
muh apple pie is now 1.20 wtff
I recently realize Macdonald do not offer $1 coke. Now it’s $1.20
meal upsize is 70 cents instead of 50 cents iirc
hawker center many stores have price change stickers
"About 2 weeks ago, I had this conversation with a friend (about 9 years my junior whom I met at workplace). I definitely consider him a talent. Talented and strong passion for Comp Sci/IT/ICT subject matter. Furthermore, he has many good traits ( e.g. learns fast, polite, humble, helpful, positive work attitude, and street-smart). He asked me...Junior: ""I want to build my career with a good job.""Me: ""Consider GovTech. I have 2 acquaintances, and based on their accounts plus my personal observation, I feel that GovTech is doing the right thing. Try to move away from big SI companies. try GovTech!""Junior: ""I am not a scholar. I won't progress with GovTech.""It's truly time to catch up for public service."
"As far as I know, GovTech actually looks at paper less than other gov agencies.Could you elaborate on your observation that leads you to feel that GovTech is doing the right thing?"
GovTech actually looks at paper less than other gov agencies.True. But is it enough - could this chap go further at Govtech than in the private sector or will there always be a ceiling because of his grades at uni or even poly/A levels? I'm not convinced that our public sector has moved past setting a grade cap even if someone shows great skill and talent on the job.
"Valid point.Whether that chap can go further in the public or private sector depends on many other factors.The grade cap aside, we also need to move past career progression based on how well a person wayang, bootlicks, and plays politics."
"The grade cap aside, we also need to move past career progression based on how well a person wayang, bootlicks, and plays politics.I don't think this problem is unique to the public sector though :/"
So much this.
"That’s because most of the technical works are being outsource to NC$ / ST. Gov tech are more to management of projects. Like other gov sectors, paper are more important and how many “successful” white elephant projects you have, to justify getting promotion.There are a lot of internal politics in gov sector (worst than private), you can lead a project and not be recognized as they (higher management) can end up changing the details and omit you. Your middle managers are mostly trying to cover their own ass and rather avoid conflict or arrow towards himself.Unlike private sector where you are viewed for you skills. Gov draw line diploma / degree / scholars in terms of project and salary. Even if in the team have someone with experience but no paper, will get ignore for fresh grad / scholar for advice.It’s mostly condescending attitude from management if you aren’t scholars."
NC$Brilliant renaming
Someone appreciates it. Thanks.
"The condescending attitude is also very much entrenched in some depts in a Ministry that I work with especially policy folks. I have observed how relatively young officers (in early to mid 30s) metaphorically slap around and ignore people with 20+ years real world public sector experience (in mid to late 40s) who are competent and professional in their own fields. Officer type scholar (choose to ""opt-out"" of admin service with Ivy league qualifications) who withhold information, do not build good teamwork or culture, practice top-down ""do what I say"" and force you to clear all interactions with external agencies through them.If they were able to deliver on their KPIs I would still tolerate such abuse but I saw first-hand how they screwed up the project with their poor planning that led to ground operational issues. It led me to see that they lack integrity, i.e. they outright did not do the right things and hid their failures/oversight from the bosses for the project to get off the ground.Not all scholars are bad. It's just the scholarship system breeds this elitist class of public officers who are entitled, lack empathy and common sense and who are very arrogant and poor at working with people who are technically stronger than them as these scholars are policy types (talk well, write well, play politics well) with no real professional depth e.g. are not professional engineer, or chartered accountant or architect or lawyer."
"Yup, this is accurate. There's a certain ""policy look down on ops"" culture that results in Ministry look down on stat board. Stat board scholars who often get sent to do real ops get looked down upon by ivory tower PSLP/AO types who have never done an ops rotation. Their ""ops rotation"" is at most going to some stat board for six months and still doing policy work.Don't get me wrong, Ministry scholars are typically on average much smarter, write better, and well spoken compared to farmers. But if you boil down their entire work scope to the bare essence, it's just googling, summarising, writing minutes and staffing (e.g. butler) for bigshot.That said, in modern SG gahmen, there is no longer much technical capability compared to yesteryears, thanks to the privatisation of ops assets eg construction in HDB, SMRT, CAG. so it's not like stat boards are a bastion of technical knowledge either."

"Could you elaborate on your observation that leads you to feel that GovTech is doing the right thing?Didn't realise that my reply to your post was deleted by reddit bot.To name only a fewform.gov.sg (Save money plus secure data)portal.blueprint.gov.sg (Save money)https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/tech-kaki-community/ (Build community)I could imagine, not sure if it's part of their announced plan, GovTech going forward could be doing these:On a smaller scale, building doc.gov.sg. The Google Doc of Singapore Govt for meeting minutes and other real-time collaboration.On a medium scale, building GovTech's Cloud Services like AWS, GCP.On a larger scale, spin-off a subsidiary doing tech consulting to other governments.Personally, I think joining GovTech as a career is well worth a go."
"GovTech, with all due respect, is not a good place to learn/practice real IT skills. Many of the GovTech folks especially those posted to Government agencies, get by through mostly ""project management"" i.e. getting vendors to work and being the middle-man between vendors and users. The higher you go up, the more typical public sector skills like politics and bureaucracy are the key to survival and climbing the corporate ladder. I have dealt with GovTech both as a user (in Govt agency working on IT projects) as a vendor being ""managed"" by them. Based on my own observations, it is not a good place to hone real IT skills."
"Yes and no.. I sat on both sides of the table and I am back on the vendor side.There is a greater chance of those ""project management"" types (they are now called business analysts after their realignment) that ain't technical. I pull my hair out dealing with these. Doing a tech project and don't understand tech ideas and concepts. Yes, I know and have seen a couple of them trying to ingraite themselves with their senior management (e.g cluster directors)But they have good people as well, especially those hired in the last two years in their technical streams (e.g. solution architects). We can have good conversations and get down to a solution. Their guys in HIVE and Hongyi's team is pretty good too."
"This is not an accurate characterization of Hive. And honestly, rather than rumour milling, your friend should ask someone working wherever he is applying to, because departments vary.From my observations, if you are smart, willing to speak up for your opinions and technically proficient, you'd go as far as the scholars.Incidentally, it's also where PSC scholars' careers go to die, because ops postings are looked down upon. But GovTech per se, there're too many technical positions to fill you'll have room to carve a niche for yourself.In short, we had work to do, and no business ingratiating ourselves to your scholarship agency if you couldn't get work done. Besides, once you're out of the PSLP, nobody cares more/less what you do."
"Hive is not an accurate characterization of GovTech or tech in general in public service. 😁That said, that scholar is better off at GovTech Hive than anywhere else in government if he/she wants to be in a technical role."
"Lien guy throws so much shade on Oxford Brexiteers attendees, happily points out that two founding fathers have no degree but conveniently omits that LKY topped his law cohort at Cambridge? And then goes on to praise other Oxford alumni?Sounds like an incoherent mess to me or maybe it's the journos fault."
"two founding fathers have no degreeIt's also not really applicable to the modern world because back then you didn't actually need a degree even for most white collar jobs.Rajaratnam, for example, was a law student but couldn't finish his degree because WW2 cut him off from family funds back in Malaya. He turned to journalism to earn a living and just carried on in that career. No one expected journalists to have degrees, and the same was true in most fields apart from the regulated professions.Having said that, I think his point was that the Oxford graduates he cites are examples of academically talented people outside the scholar system."
"Donald Low is a govt scholar if I'm not wrong. And Cameron had middling high school/uni results.It's not hard to make his point but somehow he chose really bad examples.There are a ton of academically gifted and capable people who are outside the scholar system. The large majority of scholars are just the subset of poor and/or misguided ones. And of course the select few who truly want to be ministers/chief of defence forceEdit: Also, LKY very nearly didn't get to study at Cambridge due to the war as well."
"It was also really odd that after talking about how top students often don't shake up the system, Lien goes on to criticise the Brexiteers for ""causing a mess"". Putting aside your views on brexit, this is pretty much the brexiteers trying to shake up the system."
"Yeah seriously, I'm not sure I would agree that BoJo and Tan Jee Say are opposite ends of the spectrum"
"On the other hand, leaders who led the United Kingdom through the Brexit referendum and its move out of the European Union “caused a mess because they went to Oxford”, [Laurence Lien] said.I would add that drawing a causal relationship between an Oxford education and Brexit reflects poorly on Lien's thinking (or perhaps Today's reporting). Just because many of the people in Cameron's cabinet went to Oxford doesn't mean that is behind their mistakes. Most people from Oxford voted 'Remain' in the referendum, suggesting that most Oxford residents (which includes a lot of Oxford University students and staff) were more ""sensible"" (at least in what I think would be Lien's assessment of their vote choice) than the average British citizen about the prospect of the UK leaving the EU. (Conflict of Interest: I am a Cambridge grad)Overall, the article is a little messy. I suspect it is not that Laurence Lien was incoherent in his remarks, but Today skipped over portions that would make it flow better and made him look incoherent as a result.While I do agree with the civil service needing to change their meritocratic benchmarks, I think that the civil service has already made a lot of progress in this given that I, with an impeccable educational pedigree, feel worried about whether I have the skills to work for the government when I look at the Gov.sg job portal."
"I would add that drawing a causal relationship between an Oxford education and Brexit reflects poorly on Lien's thinking (or perhaps Today's reporting).Definitely, especially when he later brought up examples of ""good"" Oxford alumni. It sounds likely to be bad reporting because I can't imagine someone making such terrible arguments in a press release but you never know.While I do agree with the civil service needing to change their meritocratic benchmarks, I think that the civil service has already made a lot of progress in this given that I, with an impeccable educational pedigree, feel worried about whether I have the skills to work for the government when I look at the Gov.sg job portal.Why do you feel that you don't have the skills?"
For most jobs there is one line on degree and a lot of lines on experience and skills for the job. It seems like fresh grads would need to be prepared to have other things on their CV to meet the requirements.Although I also suck at these things so I may be missing something important. Do tell me if I am
"The government should just stop the practice of fast tracking scholars just because they are scholars. It really goes against the spirit of meritocracy. I don't mind them getting a scholarship cos they did well for A levels. But after a year of work, their academic result from a year ago should not have any bearing on their career progression.The same goes for poly vs uni progression. Why should it matter after a year of work? If a guy from poly outperforms a guy in uni then he deserve the promotion.I feel like the government is just being lazy instead of actually evaluating their employees."
"Well said.It's a classic example of the sunk-cost fallacy.Here's a simple example of the sunk-cost fallacy: You buy an expensive fruit. Later on, you realize its gone bad. However, because you spent a lot on it, you insist on eating it. As a result, you fall sick. In the end, you've essentially spent money to make yourself sick. You'd have been better off throwing the fruit away and writing off its sunk cost.It's the same with scholars. The civil service spends lots of money on their educations. Some fail to perform when they're given real world tasks. Instead of ditching these ""spoiled fruits"", the civil service clings on to them. The result? The civil service essentially spends money to degrade their own standards. The civil service would be better off ditching them.The reluctance to ditch scholars will exacerbate a fundamental issue that our system will grapple with in coming decades. Here's the thing - our education system has been outdated for a while now. This means we've been giving scholarships to people who lacked the capacity to see that the system was outdated. Naturally, many lack the ability to see the big picture. Because of the scholar system, some of these small-minded types may rise to positions of authority in coming decades.Obviously, we can't generalize about all scholars. There are many brilliant, committed individuals in the system. But I fully agree:I feel like the government is just being lazy instead of actually evaluating their employees.Lots of private companies evaluate employees based on performance. Why in the world are different tracks necessary in the civil service? It does seem like laziness/resistance to improving themselves."
Well you have associates' track in banks as well versus the people doing grunt work so it's just different I guess.The people doing the counter teller jobs are unlikely ever going to make 150k a year in AVP role. If they do it will be rare and after many many years.
"Well you have associates' track in banks as well versus the people doing grunt work so it's just different I guess.Not familiar with how banks do things, that's an interesting point though. Are these career-spanning tracks or just for initial exposure? Do banks have predetermined ""glass ceilings"" for different educational qualifications?Edit: To be clear, ""glass ceilings"" meaning stuff like the civil service's Current Estimated Potential (CEP) metric. From an old Reddit comment:Civil service is very rigid. If you are not a scholar, you are a farmer. It's extremely difficult to break out of the mould.CEP (Current Estimated Potential) is set during recruitment and based mainly on grades. It's incredibly difficult to have it increased unless you go for further studies.There are some Ministries which are the exceptions. Foreign Affairs is one of those."
"These management associate programs in banking merely fast track you for the first few years, and don't necessarily raise your career ceiling unlike scholarships in civil service. But we can't deny that the initial exposure gives them some advantage. But the difference between MA and non-MA track in banks is definitely smaller than the difference between scholar and farmer in civil service."
Ah okay that makes sense.
What is fast tracking though? How do you think the fast tracking happens?
"when the guy 30+ yo, 3 crab already"
Can you give a specific example?
"Its pretty well known that how high someone rises in SAF typically depends on which scholarship they got. Tough luck for those without the most prestigious scholarships who wants to rise to a high position.You can refer to a recent AMA done by a former regular Major in this very subreddit. He mentioned that you can roughly estimate what your highest rank will be based on your scholarship/ uni results.For an example, in my nsf days there were a major and ltc of the same age. From what i heard the major only had a diploma whereas the ltc was a high-flying scholar."
With SAFOS you usually hit LTC by 32 or so. They need to give you space to potentially hit 3 stars before you retire.
"So I think an important question is: did they deserve it? Not the SAFOS, but whether the promotion was merited.That's a tricky question to answer, and it's not just a matter of oh he must be promoted to XX by this time. There's two parts to it: opportunity to distinguish self, and then the promotion itself."
"Fast tracking means scholars are given plum assignments and work that are high profile (typcially policy work involving something new and relevant to agency's strategic thrust) and visible by the senior management. i.e. PS, Ministers or even cabinet. So if you are giving a high profile assignment and you do well, it is very visible by your reporting and countersigning officers as well as your Head of Dept and other Heads of Depts.Ceteris paribus, your competitor (non-scholar) who is given a similar sized assignment but not as high profile, is more maintenance, i.e. operational work of carrying on with existing policy with minor tweaks, is already something the agency is doing. Even if the competitor is doing well, it is less visible. When it comes to performance appraisal and ranking, even if both officers get good grading, say A-B band, guess who is more likely to get the A vs B or B vs C+? And also as the scholar could have started with high CEP (because agency would shoot itself in the foot if it establishes that their scholar whom they invested time, money and effort to recruit, groom etc. were to start with the same CEP as all the rank and file recruited off PSD recruitment website).There is somewhat a built-in bias to give the scholars more opportunities to showcase themselves and their work. Thus, if the scholar delivers, they will tend to get the better performance grades and as CEP determines your progression in your scheme of service, scholars tend to be promoted faster.One of the public sector's challenges is that meritocracy starts at the academic qualifications but is not so fairly applied on performance per se. And performance is also quite narrow, you can meet your KPI by driving your team very hard and being an a-hole. But the team culture may suffer and good people get disillusioned and quit the organisation. Does this benefit the agency and the public sector as a whole?"
"So that's a fair answer to work with.To be honest, I'm not really sure if that's ""unfair"" per se. If we proceed with the idea that scholarships are a recruitment and apprenticeship tool rather than ""financial aid"", then this does make sense.The idea here is this: as an organisation we scrutinise you. During your undergraduate studies, we drag you back for internships, programmes, etc to help us look at you closely. When you get back to work for us, we test you by giving you difficult projects (which tend to be high profile), and we see if you succeed. I know of many scholars who also didn't succeed, and then they got sidelined after that. In my ministry at least: the byword is that scholars will get ""stretched"". Unfortunately, this stretching is often exhausting, and they get additional load and responsibility that eats up their weekends and they end up looking like zombies. The real reason behind the ""stretching"" is to assess their potential and their CEP (CEP is fluid for the first five years of their career and can be adjusted downwards).Is it meritocracy? I'd argue yes. This is because meritocracy suffers from what is known as a discovery problem: you can be good, but how do you expose how good you are to those who assess you? By committing to an organisation early and spending at least 4 years interacting with them in various forms, and committing to another 4-6 years with them, the organisation is able to plan a long-term developmental roadmap that also includes examining them thoroughly. Is it unfair? Opinions might vary: I think it's at a reasonable level so long as opportunities are also being distributed to other people as well who are not scholars to solve the discovery problem.So again, fast-tracking is a dangerous term in my opinion, because many people think that promotion is just a matter of time in grade and scholars get a shortened time in grade. No, it's about proving that you have the chops: scholars do get an advantage in that they have 4 years of scrutiny during their studies, and they're closely scrutinised beyond that. But it's not a matter of sitting there and waiting for the promotion to roll in."
"Agree. If they’re that good, why is there a need to purposely fast track them?"
totally agree. also scholarships should be scrapped. Bursaries should only be for the poor.
Agree. I don't understand why bursaries are given to people who can afford it and will use money to get to where they need anyway.
I think fast tracking to DD level is OK. There are only so many positions at that level and you should give more to those with potential.It's not that different in the private sector. Say if you apply for a management associate program from a large bank. You will be fast tracked to AVP/VP compared to someone starting as a grunt in back office. And it still depends on your grades and internships. Good luck if you have a private uni degree with terrible GPA
"I don't get Singapore's obsession with ""fast-track"" programs. That's not how the world works, there is no finish line in the real world.It's fine to pick candidates with good grades from good schools. But promoting someone because of what he did 5-10 years ago is insane. People should be kept on their toes and not be allowed to rest on their laurels."
"If you compare with other govts, SG gahmen staff are much brighter and more driven. On par with Japan (no scholarship system, flat 5 year no assessment/promotion period then subquent differentiation), USA (federal level is super competitive and siao-on) and EU. SG is miles ahead of Australia, ASEAN, China etc. If anything, SG's problem is that too few talents go to SMEs."
"Having been in the public service previously, I do think there's a problem on getting talent in the public service, but it's a bigger issue than just the focus on academic grades.Personally I believe the bigger issue is that the public service rarely hires late-career talent, meaning that the talent pool in the civil service is largely only drawn from within the public service.What exacerbates this is that, in what seems to be increasing numbers (based on my batch of ""scholars"" at least), talent also seems to be leaving the civil service, especially since many more opportunities exist in the private sector.I would actually argue that there is some correlation between academic results and general intelligence, and some correlation between general intelligence and work performance. On average, a Straight-A scholar will probably do better than a C student.However, while that might work at the start of employment, if you're looking at high-level appointments, you're not looking at averages but at long-tails, and this makes it more likely that your top performer would not be a Straight-A scholar, simply because the population to select from is so much higher. Yet, because the civil service rarely hires from outside (from what I've seen), they won't get any of the non-Straight A star performers they missed out early in the selection process. This means that they're left with only a miniscule population of Straight-A star performers, and have to promote people who simply aren't of the required standard.TLDR: If you're looking for an above-average performer, your Straight-A scholar is more likely to fit the bill. If you're looking for a star performer, you'll have to look at the much wider population simply because of how few star performers there are in total, and the public service does poorly in this aspect (or, frankly, no star performer from the private sector wants to work in government).I'll add another observation here, that does fit in with the general sentiment about scholars getting promoted despite poor performance - there was a sense that nobody wanted to be the one to torpedo a scholar's career, for various reasons (firstly, a lot of extra work, secondly it would prevent other scholars from wanting to work with you in future). These scholars don't eventually get promoted to the highest levels (where competition is keen). However, what happens is that they do prevent some non-scholars from rising fast enough at the mid-levels to compete later on. Which further increases the need for the public service to recruit from outside (which it doesn't / can't)"
"or, frankly, no star performer from the private sector wants to work in government).Pretty much this.Pay and benefits much better, a lot less restrictions on getting stuff done, far less public scrutiny, higher tolerance of political views.Most move to govt for work life balance. Which generally doesn't exist at the highest levels anyway."
It’s not true that gahmen doesn’t hire from outside. It’s however true that at D level and above no sane capable private sector person will join since it’s a pay cut.
"Too late. The system is already broken. There is already too much group-think and conformity within the public sector amongst the leadership and mid-management when facing new issues and challenges. The system is too entrenched because the people at the apex roles were for the majority, beneficiaries and products of the scholarship/""mandarin"" system that brought them there. It is the Innovator's Dilemma (""If it ain't broke, don't fix it""). How do you change something that has served you (personally) and for the system well and where you and your peers personally benefit from it? Why would those in the system, metaphorically, kill the goose that lays the golden eggs (promotions, status, power, money)?"
"I think the issue is between “pick” vs “groom” talent.There is nothing wrong with the current scholar system where they pick students with excellent academic + non-academic records to be selected and groom them to be next gen leaders.It’s really just a matter of using your limited resources wisely. The small group of students that has shown good academic + signs of leadership should be afforded the most resources to ensure they succeed. This includes quick promotions from junior ranks so that they can have good exposures from all different departments by the time they hit 35-40 before they reach senior management level.To this end, I think ministries are doing fine based on my personal experiences. I’m not from any ministries but my wife is one, and I have many scholar friends (and also know many who broke bonds personally). My understanding is that scholars have higher CEP, but they are still ultimately graded on their own merit. It is true that they are given more opportunities, but again his boils back down to we have limited opportunities and honestly not everybody should be given equal chance at a shot as there are limited time/resources. It’s not fair, but it’s practical.The only problem comes when we die die want to see these group of scholars succeed even when they’ve proven to be not suitable. Heard from grapevine that the grading system in some ministry mandates that scholars must be given a B or above, whole non-scholar is given C and B at best. Now this is unfair and you’re not measuring your talent pool based on merit. I’m ok with uneven opportunities, but I’m not ok with uneven assessment.You can groom your selected pool of talent, but when it comes to picking the best fruits, you should not just focused on the tree that you have meticulously planted just because of sunk cost mentality. There are wild trees that sometimes may bear even better fruits. If you spot them you should just admit that the other fruits are better and then start to put more effort on the newly identified trees."
"More than that, the scholarships generally tend to select scholars with a certain profile. Especially the SAF ones.And once you start work, opportunities also accrue to those who think similarly to those at the top, all else being equal.The reason why people perceive that all scholars think the same way is largely because those that don't have left largely of their own accord and those that are left at DD or higher level are by and large those who fit the system. Certainly, the vast majority have sufficient mobility to leave if they wanted."
What other profile can you reasonably have? It’s just good in team sport + good grades for SAF.FWIW president scholar have been pretty varied in recent years.
"My personal impression is that SAF scholars (top tier ones like SAFOS/SMS) generally tend to be more supportive of authoritarianism, less critical of the systems in place, rah rah keechiu kuan compared to others (PSC, GIC). Those that don't fit this role generally don't stay on after the bond.PSC scholars are more of a mixed bag but generally I feel they are able to weigh critical issues better.Edit: President's scholarships aren't worth any significant amount of money. I believe you need to get another scholarship to pay for overseas studies. At least during my time."
"President's Scholar is an additional, purely symbolic distinction given to SAFOS or PSC scholars deemed to be the best of their batch. It bears no additional benefit package of its own."
"Yes. The issue is when the trashy scholars who have failed again and again are not let go and still promoted, to fuck up even harder and in a larger scale.The good scholars are like 90% of the scholar population but the bad ones linger around like a bad smell."
"Yes. The issue is when the trashy scholars who have failed again and again are not let go and still promoted, to fuck up even harder and in a larger scale.Can you give anecdotal examples of when this happens? AFAIK no one is ever let go from a government job except in case of extreme scandal. There are a lot of inefficiencies in the system from personal experience. Many of them at lower levels. So I don't see why bad scholars should be let go. Most of the time they just hentak kaki and leave of their own accord.I don't know what you mean by ""again and again"" but shit like this happens in the private sector as well."
What do you understand by the phrase “let go”? There are tonnes of scholars who linger around especially in stat boards which are like feudal fiefs.
Let go = being fired?I've never heard of anyone outright being fired from a govt job even though there is a ton of incompetent deadweight in the civil service. At worst you just get a shitty appraisal and minimum bonus/increment.Typically they just put people where they can be contained and do minimal damage.This is not unique to scholars. Basically the CMI people all stay where they are because they will die in the private sector.Edit: To clarify my earlier point I was wondering what you mean by fucking up again and again and still getting promoted and whether you had anecdotal examples.Typically scholars are given chances for fucking up but they will hit a ceiling eventually. They can't be let go just like other government employees.
Ok yeah. But you know many cmi scholars are still promoted in stat boards.
"I think they also boh pian. Stat boards don't really attract the best talent in terms of non scholars due to their generally lower pay. Unless you know for sure that talented people are getting passed on for scholars.The main problem is, whoever promotes someone over some scholars will have their head on the chopping block if the promotee fails. Whereas with scholars just blame it on the system.Edit: Usually they are stuck somewhere around DD/D level. Which is high for most people but probably the minimum level scholars will expect to hit by mid career and less than private sector."
Temasek Foundation Cares is apparently the place where President Scholars go to die
Minimal damage is still billions of wasted tax dollars and influx of more dead weights (how well do you think the CMI people recruit)?Is there anything we can do to stop this jiak liao bee problem?
"there is a lot of evidence that straight A students do not end up as the best business or management leaders. there are good reasons why they are straight A students: they study a lot, rely a lot on memory, take very few risks.they tend to be obedient they tend to look up to authority they tend to depend on authority for right answers they tend to follow rules (ke chui for teacher to pick me) they tend to desire the approval of their chosen person of authority tend not to think out of the box tend to be conformistsYet we have stupidly used this as the main criteria for selecting ""scholars""Then we put them on a protected path all the way to the top. They never have to experience failure like others. They are access to $$$ and approval to make their projects a success (even then they fail often). They never have to learn how to manage up or down (bosses are scared of them, subordinates are even more scared). They never have to influence or persuade. They get away with arrogance (i am not making this up, i worked with many scholars in my life, once i was scolded by a scholar for starting a meeting late when the issue was half his department has yet to show up, another time i was in a meeting with a Minister of State and his feet was on the table during the whole meeting where he spoke to us in a condescending manner .... list goes on)only idiots will vote for this"
"Straight A student have the discipline to study until perfect score, have great memory, are more driven and intelligent. The 'a lot of evidence' you mentioned sound dubious, but okay.However, I think the government should stop with the 'scholar' thing. It seriously limit the talent pool they can access. Why are generals and head of government post restricted to a tiny pool of scholars? Why not open the position for fair competition among all government employees, instead of fast tracking scholars? Why deter good people who didn't apply for scholarship from joining the civil and public services by limiting their career path? I'm sure there are late bloomers that are just as good, or even better than some of the scholars.There are students who are rich enough and don't need the scholarship, but are 'forced' to apply because of the prestige of the program in civil service. That deprives one more spot to students who need that financial assistance, further limiting the talent pool and widening the gulf between the rich and the poor.Scholars made sense in the past and have helped us a lot, but it's time to stop it. It's not helping, and even actively hurting us now."
Scholarships are not financial assistance: bursaries are.

"those skills do not translate universally across all things, im sure everyone has had run ins with scholars with all the knowledge but a total car crash when it comes to the execution of basically anything"
"Not everyone have run ins with scholars that are totally useless. Most of the time, they will come across as normal people, not too different from you and me.And of course, no skills will translate universally to everything, but that's no reason to make light of core characteristics like discipline, drive and memory."
Ditto. The scholars I have worked with are not perfect. But many of them are really better than a lot of non-scholars.
Get your facts straight though: anyone in the public service can apply for the PSLP. Get in there and you'll be fast tracked just like the others.

Genuinely curious. I don't quite see any evidence at all - only anecdotes that simply attest to survivorship bias. Can you point me in the direction where you found the evidence?

"To add on to your comment, the current research on talent/intelligence etc. does state that standardised test scores nowadays don't really equate well to success. In fact, standardised tests only measure a very narrow domain of intelligence, mainly crystallised intelligence (of which rote learning is a factor of). Moreover, there's some arguments that perhaps students are actually only getting better at test taking itself but not learning.If you read in depth into a lot of the more modern research into intelligence and success, our education system actually has a lot of aspects that are counter productive to suggested practices. My personal opinion is that the people who actually are able to make decisions are not willing to deviate from the status quo.puts on tin foil hat I feel that the current minister of education however seems to have been making many more progressive suggestions that are evidence based, however this has made him unpopular within the party, hence his early dropping out from the race for PM."
i agree that the current Minister of Education is actually making sense. It is quite unnerving because i am not used to these people making sense anymore.
I like that tinhat opinion. Have my upvote
"https://qz.com/853128/grades-not-iq-or-standardized-test-score-is-what-predicts-future-success/Right. Instead of standardized tests like SAT or GMAT we should look at A-level grades instead.Oh wait, isn't that what the government is doing today?"
The A levels are a standardized test. When they (the researchers) talk about grades they are referring to overall academic performance over time.
"Let me state upfront that I agree that grades are a bad predictor of whether a given 18 year old will do a good job in leading the country in the future. I don't think any other predictors would do any better though.That being said, I don't really agree that straight A students are generally as unqualified to lead as you suggest. I would really like to see the evidence on that (as in peer review papers not some medium article).Scholarships also have different tiers and there's much greater variance in general competence as you move down the prestige pyramid. Obviously there are going to be false negatives but in my experience a person with top results from a good university is generally more competent than person without of the same age and experience.Also, lots of scholars are forced to get stellar grades to maintain the scholarship, not because they don't want to explore other areas and activities and gain life experiences. It's a chicken and egg problem"
"actually not all scholars are bad. a vast majority for them are very good actually, well meaning people who want to serve the nation. the system turns them into lousy leaders. why? everyone knows that a President scholar will become minimally a future Perm Sec.... everything will be easy for him or her and her raise to the top will be marked by many achievements , some superficial, others profound BUT tbh mostly superficial (things anyone can achieve with money, authority and power).When we take bright young talents and screw their potential by making them think hey i am God's gift to Singapore, everyone i touch works, i am so clever, everything is easy, hey i am sent to Harvard to do MBA come back get promotion some more .... what kind of leader we end up with? This kind of person is not a real leader. that's what we have in the Government today."
"why do we need to select leaders when they are 18? that's just nonsense. NOBODY else does that. This is an arrogant way of managing the future. Large companies like GE, GM, J&J used to have such systems (management trainee, scholarships, long term planning) BUT these programs have all failed to produce good CEOs. Look at GE. They have the benchmark way to develop the next Gen of CEOs. This once most valuable company in the world is now ... dying."
"The scholarship system is not a way to groom future leaders any more.It's just a cheap way for the government to indenture people early on and hopefully convince them to stay on in the civil service.Personally I feel that the government is still getting their money's worth overall from the scholarship system.Say what you like about how there are shitty scholars around, in aggregate with the salaries they are paying it would be very hard to employ similar talent from the private sector.For example if you look at the engineers staffing Govtech. Are they being paid enough to forego opportunities outside in the private sector? A lot of them are still bonded scholars."
Yup. Spoke to so many “stupid” scholars it’s not funny. I have no idea how Singapore manage to squander so much money and resources on dumb ideas by clever people.

Loving these data deals. Gonna teach those big boys a lesson of not valuing their existing customers.
I rmb when singtel downsized from 12gb a month to 2gb a few years back. Glad to see competition making these big companies change their tune
"I'm still using the 12gb data plan though... Heheh..Although, I was looking at circle's life, and their unlimited data.Singtel, whatchu got?"
"I'm also still on the 12 GB plan! Shiok, sia.But looking seriously at the new plans. I'm worried that some of these new plans will be those ""promo price"" where they revert to something ridiculous after your contract. So still hanging on to my old 12gb plan for now."
"Yup, it most probably will. From what I've checked out ever since the first pixel phone was released. (I almost pulled the trigger to recontract just so I could get that phone.)But phone was so expensive, data cut down to such a ridiculous size. How to make that decision easily!"
Sadly non mysim users will not get to enjoy this deal again.
Begun the Telco War has...
Is it even possible to burst so much data? I hv a 7gb plan and I barely use 3gb a month(which i find a waste)
"Maybe that’s the whole point. Use big numbers to draw subscribers in, knowing most of them won’t come close to using anywhere near that much data?"
"You must change your usage pattern. When I got my TPG unlimited data, i started browsing instagram and watch youtube videos like as if there is no tomorrow.Try to make good use of your data since you paid for it. I have 6GB of data but I only used about 1.5GB of it after signing up for TPG."
"I got the M1 15GB for $20 (the one I got was 16 for 18 on offer). While I only use max 5 GB a month, I got it since I was spending more or around the same on Singtel prepaid and for the simplicity of not needing to always top up. Plus it's great not having to worry about data."
Well my friend is on the old 3G 12gb plan and he still managed to exceed his plan.
Available for current mysim customers?

Yeap i got it already. Couldn't find it in the MyM1 app but i found it on the website
Do they throttle even if its not unlimited
I'm using about 8GB a month due to mobile game. About $70/month(because base plan is only 3-4) Think I need to switch.

Can’t really say what it is but I’m working on a project as a volunteer and NEED to get into contact somehow with a local politician. Any good advice?
"u must aim the correct politicianfor example, Lee Bee Wah, who is very keen to show that she is connecting with the citizens, and so will respond if u pm her on fb"
Ooh okay. Thanks for your suggestion.

"I guess oppostion MP are easier to reach out. Go queue up during the meet the peoples session, im sure they wont reject you."
"Office holders and MPs have their emails on SGDI. You can get all their official emails there.Try to be selective. Say you are volunteering for an animal shelter, pitch to the MPs that are known to have interest in this topic. Someone like TCJ or Louis Ng, or someone from MND since AVA is their stat board. Alternatively, if your event is held at Tanjong Pagar, you can invite the MP in charge of the area. Or, you can try the known attention seekers like Baeybaey. If you know someone in the exec comm of some RC, use them to contact a politician.Good luck!Edit: Since you say this event is govt affiliated, try to get the civil servant you've been working with to do some work inviting the politician in charge of the org they're in lor."
Any politician?
My event is slightly government-affiliated so it has to be PAP as well
Then why would you word it as any politician?
Mp grassroots meeting or something. The public ones
Haha. Yeah I just googled some Meet the People Sessions. Probably what I’m looking for.
"Meet the people sessions are not great for these sorts of invites. If you don't have a legit problem, the PAP volunteers will probs filter you out of the ftf meeting. For more popular politicians, you'll also have to wait forever.If you attend grassroots events, you can try to approach the politician, make small talk and mention your event in lieu of sending an official email. At least they'll have an impression of you and your event.Btw, politicians in office (Parl Sec and above) will likely know if you've sent an invite to other politicians. Their staff will check. On the other hand, normal MPs may not know so I guess they are easier targets."
Good old fashion email will work if they want to talk to you.
Wah. Whistle blowing?
Is this considered whistle blowing? There are lots of small government-affiliated events held throughout the year. I’m just seeing if there’s a way of contacting some local politician for it.
Eh? I'm asking because contacting a govt official to attend as a goh is usually done by the full time staff.

"I wonder where they get it from though? If they didn't have a car previously, do they get to pick any car from the workshop that's about to be scraped?"
"At first I was like did you report this person for parking at the disabled parking area, then I saw you mention they have the sticker and a ramp. I'm disabled and if I could, I'd totally go and learn how to ride a bike and then make a bike like this one lol."
Was more confused by how this modification was allowed (only realised it was for wheelchair-use much later) so I didn't think much about it. Yea that'll be cool!
"Hahaha right now both my feet cannot weight-bear so I can’t stand up and hop on, unless the wheelchair actually goes onto the car-bike whatchamacallit. That would be pretty rad. Unfortunately my ankles don’t allow my feet to step on pedals or I’d really like something like that to gain some independence back!"
"unless the wheelchair actually goes onto the car-bikeIt does.Unfortunately my ankles don’t allow my feet to step on pedalsThey mod the bike to use hands only.Dunno exactly how that guy's work, but saw a modded bike for wheelchair users on Reddit before.I think I remember you now. The one who I asked a lot of questions recently. You are still quite new to it. A lot of new things for you to learn and get used to.I hope your surgery works out."
"Oh sweet! But then how am I going to pass the motorbike test without walking, or is this considered a car lol?Were you the one who asked me to do an AMA on my disability? If so hi! I’m trying some pre op stuff, got Botox injected in my calves to see if they can stretch out my feet. Physiotherapy department is still thinking about whether to put me in a cast to see if it reduces the deformity in my feet. Surgeon thinks if it helps even by 20-30% it would make the surgeries less complicated. Damn pain man those Botox jabs haha"
"iirc for class 1 bike learners, you gotta buy the bike and go for lessons at any of the driving centers!Saw someone taking class 1 lesson @ cdc"
"Someone in the comments posted an article about the guy. He went to 2B driving license lessons and test. But instead of learning on a normal bike, he used his own modded bike.Ya, I'm that kaypoh."
"I don't know whether Singapore allows modifications like this, but my dad in Vietnam has his scooter modded after losing function in one leg. I don't have a picture of it, but it looks pretty close to this. It has a reverse gear, a more comfortable seat than this, and the chassis is lowered a bit to help him climb up."
This is lta approved.
Aww I can’t climb up (can’t even stand up) so I guess I’ll just have to stay home.. anyway have no motorbike license only drivers license. Hahaha!
"I'm not disabled, but I also want such a bike."
Hehehhe!!
So apparently this is the only guy in SG that modified his motorbike like this and he made several appearances on the internet. It looks like you're lucky enough to encounter him or at least his bike!
Yea! Someone shared an article about him in the comments. Hope he wasn't pissed at me for taking the photo if he saw though.

How can we be sure the bike didn't just rear-end a Prius?
I don't see any bike?
omg I saw it once in action! *.* cool uncle is the owner haha
More of a trike it has 3 wheels it's cool but I would guess it drives more like a car than a motorcycle
saw this parked in kovan as well!
Are bikes allowed to take up so much space?
It's a handicapped car.
Yea you'll see a label at the windshield with the handicap logo. Only noticed it after posting
This is bending my mental compartment for what is car and what is bike. I.e. At what point does car become bike

"With the recent release of the A level results, I believe many A level graduates will be looking up uni courses/job prospects etc. Hopefully we can list our questions in this thread and uni graduates/working professionals will be able to help out and answer our questions? ;)I have a few questions, consolidated by myself and a few other friends: (1) What is it like being a Foreign Service officer? Is the knowledge of foreign languages required when deployed overseas?(2) What is it like working as a Physiotherapist? Are the job scopes of diploma and degree holders largely different?(3) For graduates with a degree from ntu hss/nus fass/smu soss, what jobs are you currently doing? do you think if it is an advantage getting such a 'general' degree like smu soss? i saw from smu's webpage that graduates with bachelor in social science do work as business analysts...but would it be better to get a bachelor in business analytics instead?Thank you!!"
2. They have phased out dip. courses for physiotherapists. You gotta enroll for the degree course.
"Is the knowledge of foreign languages required when deployed overseas?MFA sponsors FSOs for foreign language classes if there is a need. It is not a requirement for recruitment.graduates with bachelor in social science do work as business analysts...but would it be better to get a bachelor in business analytics instead""Business analysts"" is a very generic term and actual job scope varies a lot across companies. Business analytics focuses more on data analytics specifically."
"To join MFA as a FSO, you need to have a good degree in any discipline. Generally you do not need a specific language competency but if you already have 3rd language skills that probably is helpful but not compulsory to be considered.Generally, FSO need to write and speak well (which is the common skillset for most ministry jobs that cover policy). Having said that, not all FSOs end up doing policy either in MFA HQ or in overseas missions. MFA is considered a more atas Ministry as you can get posted overseas. Upside is exposure in other countries and doing diploma, i.e. attending parties for official business. Downside, hard to get married to a local if you are overseas for 3 year stretches at a time. Benefits and perks are good as you will get allowances if you are posted overseas.One my of schoolmates who joined MFA said he sacrificed his liver for the country as he had to entertain as part of his work at overseas missions."
"I concur. A lot of my friends are FSOs or beyond in MFA. I suppose it suits a certain personality type. If you're the sort who doesn't like to mingle, doesn't like the Chinese ""hospitality"" style drink like a fish customs, and prefer to be humble sort, then shouldn't do MFA work. My MFA friends all got a certain swagger after the MFA training, act big and satki, with inflated titles so they can rep the country. It's quite interesting how image can be trained since some of them were just humble friendly nerds, but after enough MFA experience, they suddenly become like Nick Young from Crazy Rich Asians."

"From SMU SOSS, working in tech. It’s a good life!Here’s a tip - On LinkedIn’s university pages, you can actually see where past graduates report they’re working now, and FASS vs SOSS are significantly different when my cousin was asking for advice on this. Neither I feel are better per se, just what you’re looking for - corporate or public.Edit: here’s a preview https://imgur.com/a/bXaum8p"
which is more corporate? or public? i'm also having a dilemma btw fass and soss
"SOSS far more corporate, FASS public sector / NGO. Those are just general trends though, really what you make of your academic life.Edit: downvoted for factually reporting what LinkedIn shows, really?"

"Do you demand straight As or ""can pass can liao?"""
"My parents sat me down around sec 3 and tell me how reality is like.We spent about an afternoon talking about how much our monthly expenses are, what jobs average salaries are and how affordable are stuff in Singapore.Property costs a bomb. If you don’t want to drive, the bus/mrt pass do add up quite a bit. How much money is spent on food, bills etc. How much a kid is going to cost per month, ( rough estimate was $1k but it’s obviously more than that )That talk made me realized that while I can survive with me just slacking around, to do what my parents did, I need to work harder.Of course, I still slacked off every now and then but with this knowledge at the back of my head, it pushed me to do one more question or practice one more time for my studies.They did ask me if I have a specific goal in mind but i didn’t then. So just study lor, it is the route with the most options available.Donno leh, next time if I ever have kids, just tell them how reality is lah.“You want air-con? Food? Internet? How much do you think it all costs? Even if you can barely afford all these things, what about insurance? Huh? Don’t need insurance? Do you know how expensive medical bills can be? What if you get injured and can’t work? What will supplement your monthly income? “Don’t need scold or whack lah. Just talk."
Try your best.
when u try ur best but u dont succeed...
"when you get what you want, but not what you need."
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
At least no guilt.

"Can't make demands. Just help them achieve their best. Push a little, but not so hard they crack under pressure. Be there for when they fall, and help them get back up and running again. Screaming at them to so better usually won't work.It's not easy."
"For those that can afford private education, no big deal. Just end up study overseas and come back to get better job than those who mug through local (poly/ uni) education system.Those parent that push their kids are mostly due to the parent failure to succeed (reflective), therefore put pressure on their kids (next gen). Force them to be doctors / lawyer cause the parents couldn’t do it then."
"my parents demanded that i must top my class or else i wont get any PSP . It definitely gave me a drive to study hard just because of the reward .But if I have my own children in the future , i will push them to love the process of gaining knowledge rather than the asking them to achieve high grades . I would be so proud if my child has any interest to take their own initiative to learn more about the world works etc. Eg. Watching documentaries , looking up on the internet and reading books"
You restored my fate that Singapore future is not as bleak as I imagined it to be. We need more of you as educators in our schools.
"My lifelong ambition is actually to be a lecturer(currently an undergrad) , so thank you for your comment , i really appreciate it :)"
"Many parents make demands, but do absolutely nothing to help their kids achieve those goals. There's a huge difference between the parents of an A student and parents of a C student who is expected to get As."
Yes.
"(Answering on behalf of my parents)""Can pass can liao."""
"Thing is, people can be pushed very very far into the discomfort zone and go on to perform very well in that, be it in academics, gymnastics, football, music etc. Kids don't have a good sense of discipline early on from what I know.It's more of pushing a kid to do their best knowing that it will very well be uncomfortable...... Without breaking their sense of childish wonder and staining the relationships the kid has with other people and activities. That is so tough.Do you push the kid knowing that they can be one of the best swimmer in the world when they are exhausted and tired by the poolside? TBH I really don't know, but I'd personally think to be around 70% of the way there in intensity, where 100% is Olympic level training, 50% is regular weekly training for something since young (be it tuition or piano lessons), and 0% is ""do what you like to do"". This together with a good dose of teaching what motivation and discipline are, and hopefully being a real life example."
"I've come to terms that I won't be around forever... And to look into the far future when I am no longer here, I know instilling values, resilience and habits is more important than getting As. I cannot guarantee my child success all the time, but I can help them deal with failure. It feels like a tightrope act sometimes, you need your child to know the value of hard work but not be tunnel-visioned and results-driven... but if too relax they also slack off. Parenting is tough."
My parents just tell me to try my best
"I'm a guy who just finished serving NS, so this will be my third time applying for uni using my A Level results from 2016.So yea as a guy you have more cycles of application that you can try for since you're in NS anyway.I keep applying because there is a particular course I really want, but can't get in for the past 2 years.What to do if your grades don't hit the mark for a certain course? Does discretionary admission (DA) help a big deal?Also I saw that NTU is looking for more holistic qualifications starting this year, but I don't see that anywhere in their application form. Not sure if that is DA?"
"NTU is increasing the number of places available for computing related courses for this year, so you might stand a chance.CS is not a part of the list for holistic admissions, but ""interviews will also be conducted for high potential candidates who may fall slightly short of the entry score for a degree course, or for those considered based on their talent in fields such as the arts and sports, under Discretionary Admissions. A prospective student who shows passion and enthusiasm for a chosen programme, and potential to succeed may have an edge over a more academically qualified applicant vying for the same course."""
what course are you aiming for?
"Comp science, my RP is 80"
"If it helps, apply for comp engin and then change to comp sci in ntu. That’s what a lot of the comp engin cohort does."
Huh? Change course when you get accepted into comp engine?
Hi I'm a year 3 com sci student in NTU. I switched from com engine to com sci after sem 1. Both courses take the same mods in year 1 so switching is not an issue.
Wow! How does the switch work? Do you have to hit a certain criteria first? Is there a limiter number of students that can switch?
"by-right by-left kind of thing, if your GPA is good enough they'll definitely let you make the switch."
Don't think there's a criteria. My grades were decent but I don't know if they used grades as a consideration. Don't think there's a limit too I think 1/3 or even half of students switched over haha.
"unless u have represented sg (SEA games, etc) in competitions or brought back medals, DA is quite hard"
"Not true. If you get some achievements in school or outside, you are able to get in DA. As long as you have genuine interest, you can be shortlisted."

Hmm. I've never national level competitions but I did win one local competition.It's a matter of showing how proactive you are in participating and taking charge. Doesn't matter if you aren't that good (which I certainly am not)

Any1 here passed their driving test recently? Any1 has good recommendations with regards to who the best instructors or schools are?
The SPF has a list
"Got mine about 2 months ago at BBDC.Personally i'd recommend going for a school that's near you (well except comfort delgro's driving centre, I hear that one is less than stellar), and yes, it may look like it costs more but I feel that you're more likely to pass on your first try by going to these driving schools. I myself passed my test on my first try.Take note though that some of these schools make it compulsory to do 'lessons' before doing something like the theory test itself. Which admittedly wastes time and money. Ultimately whether you wish to go private or go via driving school is up to you.All that said good luck with taking up driving, I think it's something useful to have, even if you don't necessarily intend to own a car.EDIT: Forgot to mention about private, it is faster and cheaper (that's the idea at least), no lying about that, but I have noticed private candidates are more likely to fail on their first try."

I am only interested in the Oppo wards (Ajunied and Hougang). See whether WP can hold onto them.I live in Aljunied GRC btw.
"WP should have no problem defending them. Even with the AHTC lawsuit.SG50 sentiment has faded, WP's town council report has improved, and more importantly WP has a succession plan post-LTK (mirroring PAP's 4G generation succession) - Pritam's doing quite well in his role as chief. Plus many more e.g. Daniel Goh, Perera.As of now I haven't seen any promising new blood whether from SDP or Tan Cheng Bock.SPP have Jose Raymond (Vivian Balakrishnan's former press sec) - they have a shot at taking back Potong Pasir if they field himWP's next targets should be East Coast / Fengshan. And take back Punggol East, IF it remains as SMC."
"SG50 sentiment has faded,Not only that, but during GE2015 also had LKY passing away which made people turn towards the PAP emotionally, even then WP was still able to hold on to aljunied. Its highly unlikely that WP will lose aljunied next election."
"Honestly I’ve met and spoken to Pritam Singh before in Parliament. He’s really a super down-to-earth guy and although the other MPs were nice, he’s really a class of his own!"

"People forget demographic replacement, lots of new residents and older residents have passed. Along with new housing projects in the area. I don't think it looks good for the opposition in Aljunied. If there is further gerrymandering, it is a grave situation."
Honestly it doesn't matter when it's happening. We all know how the results will be and GST will be increased soon.

"Unfortunately for Jolovan’s position, he was advised to apply for a permit which he opted to ignore.It weakens rather than strengthens his position since whether or not he would have been granted one is now unknowable. As it is it just looks like stupid grandstanding and martyrdom, or at worst being a foreign puppet.I’ve said it before, he never wanted the permit and wanted the opportunity to get publicity and prove a point by going to jail. But what point is it if his permit was never rejected in the first place?"

Hello! I’ve just started looking into doing some minor investing and stumbled upon the SSB. I was wondering if anyone can give some views on this.Is it better to drop like $50-100 a month into the bond? Or save up to $1k-2k before buying each time?Is there any need for application to be done before starting the investment?Is it difficult to buy and withdraw the invested amounts?Any other views about simple investing in SG would be greatly appreciated!Thanks in advance.
"If you want to invest a small amount each month, can consider etf. I'm currently putting $100 a month for my kid. It's slow but I'm in no hurry to take it out."
Oh! How do I go about doing that?
I get mine using my posb internet banking account. There's an option. So I set it to auto buy every month.
% returns? better than ssb?
it comes with extra risk..
"I recommend the book ""Rich by Retirement: How Singaporeans Can Invest Smart and Retire Wealthy"" by Joshua Giersch. You can read the preview of the book on Amazon (""Look Inside"" link). The author has been giving personal finance advice on Hardwarezone for SG investors since 2010. You can also get the PDF version of the book for USD$8.I have no affiliation with the author. I bought a copy of his book on the recommendation of others for my own research and found it useful. I refer to it time to time. Basically, the author tells you:• exactly what to invest in• how to do it in Singapore• what ratio of ETFs and bonds you should be having in your investment portfolio (depending on how old you are.)"

what is SGS bond ? the page link was broke. thanks :)
The link to SSB works.https://blog.moneysmart.sg/invest/singapore-savings-bonds-review/
sorry if i wasn't clear i meant SGS bond link (on the SSB page)It seems they are different. Do you have any knowledge of that? Thank you!
"Is it better to drop like $50-100 a month into the bond? Or save up to $1k-2k before buying each time?The minimum amount to purchase is $500 (increments of $500)What I do is (and this is NOT financial advice!) to throw in $500 every month on new SSB for 12 months (2 months in right now) and you can receive payments every month. The reason I did this is to receive payouts every month just to feel good (to each their own)Is there any need for application to be done before starting the investment?Apply for a CDP account beforehand here (just apply online. Much easier than through mail)Is it difficult to buy and withdraw the invested amounts?Nope, it's really simple. I use UOB to buy and sell SSBs. To buy, you just have to head to investment tab and enter your CDP account number and the amount to purchase. That's it.To sell, you just need to to head to the same tab and click on redeem."
Buying 6 consecutive months can get payment every month already.
"Oh yeah, that's true!"
Awesome! thanks.
"Assuming you are risk averse and do not want to lose your capital, SSB is fine for you. I believe another user mentioned about ETFs - these come with (potentially) higher returns but alongside greater risks/capital loss.For your actual question about sizing, it is better to put in lump sums since you’ll save on the admin fees of $2 per transaction. Low as it is, frequent buy-ins will hurt your returns (which is already low since it is bond).All you need is to create a CDP account, then start buying through your banks. You can redeem the SSB monthly but take note the interests are paid semi-annually. But if you redeem before the semi-annual, you still receive prorated interest. SSB is very retail-friendly!EDIT: changed no interest before fixed payout to prorated interest."
Interest is prorated.
You’re right! Makes SSB an even better product!
Is it better to drop like $50-100 a month into the bond? Or save up to $1k-2k before buying each time?You can only purchase in lots of 500Is there any need for application to be done before starting the investment?open a cdp accountIs it difficult to buy and withdraw the invested amounts?take abt 1 month for the money to hit your account
Oh! I’ll definitely check it out. Thanks!
"for SSB the commission only cost $2, so okay to save up 1k-2k then hoot but if your age is still young at below 30s, wiser to invest into ETFs or stock picks, as you can get higher long term returns"
"Hi, minimum is $500/m. But even then the administrative fee of $2 putting in, and $2 taking out can be costly for something that is for safe returns. If you are starting out, I've some ideas in this post that can help you understand some of the low risk investments in the market like Elastiq UL plan and bond funds that you can buy in small pieces. https://www.theastuteparent.com/2016/04/best-short-term-investment/ Hope it helps, cheers! :)"
Thanks! I’ll have a read.
"There is administrative fee of $2 putting in, and $2 taking out.I suggest putting $1000-20000 per issue. Minimum is $500.http://www.sgs.gov.sg/savingsbonds/Your-SSB/This-months-bond.aspxInterest is prorated (meaning they count exact days even if you redeem early). Hence you can put in and take out to earn the proportional interest deserved. Note that when you take out, the money only comes in at the start of next month. The $2 is deducted immediately thoughTransactions can be made via ibanking of the major banks (DBS, OCBC, UOB), or ATMs. Note that the banks only assist in the act of ""transact"", and you'll still need a CDP account like a ""wallet"" to hold the bondCDP account can be opened online or at their officehttps://www1.cdp.sgx.com/"
"Hihi.If I buy early and they deduct the money early, is it also prorated?"
"Nope. They deduct in full. Hence, people usually buy only in the last few days of the month"
And also can get a better estimate of the rates for the next month.
"Good morning fellow sg redditors, I've got a question. Let's say I bought the SSB on January, but withdrawn some money in April. Would I still get the interests in June? (6 months interest payout)Or will the date where I receive the interests be affected by the date of withdrawal, which is October?Thanks in advance :)"

"Recently, I was just pondering and was struck by the immense constant sacrifice each of our parents make to make our existence as their children possible. As someone starting out to earn my own living, I realized there is so little I can give back in actions or things to repay them. It set me wondering, what is a parent’s greatest disappointment in their child and what makes them happiest in their child?"
I'd be very happy if my kid has a good command of English (especially grammar) and learns to proofread before posting

"I think at the most basic level:Being able to support themselves and stand on their own two feetBeing happyContribute to societyBut ofc there are unreasonable parents who think their child is a disappointment if:Don't enter a prestigious profession like medicine, dentistry, lawDon't make enough bank to buy a big house and nice car for their parentsDon't have grandchildren for them to play with"
"Greatest disappointment is if they cannot learn to think critically and make balanced, rational decisions (and I don't mean the Merdeka generation's definition of rational=what I think is right)Happiest is if they can grow up to be emotionally healthy and resilient and maintain a relationship with us based on trust. Also if they can learn the lessons in this quote from a US Chief Justice:From time to time in the years to come, I hope you will be treated unfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice. I hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty. Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to time so that you don’t take friends for granted. I wish you bad luck, again, from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either. And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then, your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship. I hope you’ll be ignored so you know the importance of listening to others, and I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion. Whether I wish these things or not, they’re going to happen. And whether you benefit from them or not will depend upon your ability to see the message in your misfortunes.Also this is probably off topic but I strongly disagree with viewing of parents as sacrificial martyrs to be put on a pedestal. It is the path they chose with their eyes open (barring kids with special needs, congenital diseases etc)I cringe everytime someone remarks about how we are noble and sacrificial for doing certain things with our kids or just bringing them up in a certain way. To me it's a mutually beneficial relationship. If I am happy/willing to spend time and money for my kid it's because I gain something substantial out of it as well. I'll feel awkward if he thinks it's a sacrifice.OTOH someone who is very unwilling to do stuff for their kid and only doing it because they feel like it's their obligation, does not really deserve their kid appreciating their ""sacrifice"" since it did not come from their heart."
He must transform singapore from third world to first
"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:[/r/titlegore] What will be your the greatest disappointment and what makes your happiest in your child as a parent? If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads. (Info / ^Contact)"
"+ I'm over the moon when my infant poo poo...- When she drinks only 20ml of the 90ml formula milk I make!In general, I think parents just want their kids to be healthy, eat well. Most importantly, appreciate their effort."
sleep well too at the young age.
As long as I keep my daughter off the pole I’d be happy.
What if she chooses to be on the pole?
So you'd be okay if it were to be your son?
Are you saying you wouldn't?
how if she wants to be a firefighter
"Tbh I don't see anything wrong with that.In fact I've remarked to my wife that if my daughter is hot enough to put herself through college by selling sex-related stuff (pics/videos/used underwear) on reddit like so many on gonewild it sounds pretty awesome.Complete anonymity if you know what you're doing, no risk of meeting up IRL to take cash, you can create content once and sell it multiple times for a ton of income.My main concerns for her would be getting doxxed and stalked."
I feel like CHAS being available to all citizens is a bigger blockbuster announcement than any package they can give.
"When I was depressed and in SAFDB, I was brought to see the SAF psychiatrists in handcuffs. Inside the consultation room, I had to bare my soul to a whole panel of people, not unlike being at a job interview. There was no privacy. Forget about empathy. They were just interested in deciphering whether I was malingering. I felt like I was being judged, not helped. Even if you went to see a private psychiatrist outside, you still had to have your condition endorsed and followed up by the SAF psychiatrists. It was shit, and probably still is."
"Former mp, I can safely say it’s super hard to nail anyone for malingering. Usually you have to confess it on your own because it’s the intention that counts, and no one can divine your heart. They were most likely trying to scare you and shit. Saf is a shitty place and DB can be like Stanford prison experiment liddat, no rights no dignity."
Panel is all psychiatrists? DB means cannot go see private or can request?
"Nope. Panel is made up of chief psychiatrist, deputy, staff nurse, and other people I don't even know who they are.Not just DB, regular NSF also. Even if you see outside psychiatrist the SAF psychiatrist is the one that must officially diagnose you."
"Eh, I had a different experience as an NSF.The people at the SAF counselling centre were actually pretty nice and it was a one to one session.I also got referred to see a psychiatrist at a hospital and it was a 2 to 1 session, a doctor and a trainee, no SAF people were involved.Seems like they just treated you differently cause you were in DB"
Depression is no joke. If you suspect you have depression please do seek help. Just because it is a non-physical injury doesn't make it less severe.
Reading the article the guy clearly did try to seek help lmao even his buddy and commander knew about it.Maybe it's not up to the person but rather up to the superiors to treat it as a severe problem?
"The system is too rigid liao, issues like this treated like SOP stuff. Must tell sargent, then add in the headcount during morning RO who going report sick.Then got cases on CO micromanaging the unit MO to look higher when reporting stats. Scary stuff"
"This hits too close to home. I too am an NSF who came back from overseas just to serve. I too am struggling with anxiety, loneliness and depression. I’m even a future finance major. It can be hard for Singaporeans who have been in this environment for their whole life to empathize with how difficult it can be for us to come back to this country we must call our “homeland” even though we have no home or family here, just to “serve and fuck off”. I’m lucky enough to have just enough self control to reign in my destructive impulses but this poor kid didn’t. But that’s just how it is. So expect more to die in the future because national defense will always be more important than individual human lives."
My heart goes out to you. I would have actually encouraged you not to return since there's nothing here that actually belongs to you.I'm just curious. How do you get by being a conscript with the low pay in Singapore?
"All your meals, accommodation and clothes are catered for. You only spend money if you are out of camp.So, stay in camp as much as you can if you don't have the money."
"I'm sorry to hear that. The feelings of isolation and worthlessness in the army must be really strong - I too had that when I was serving, and I was born and raised here. I do wish to see a change in how MINDEF - and Singapore as a whole - deals with mental health issues, because that seems to be way too overlooked and stigmatized in our culture. I hope you pull through these 2 years and look forward to the bright future ahead of you :)"
"Hit me up if you ever need a beer, I'll get the first round."
"Had experience of that too, I'll buy a round"
Please take care and if ever you have a dangerous thought reach out to someone. Hope you make it through this period and come out stronger.
try doing charity/voluntary work on weekends with the less fortunate. It helps.
"So young... Rip Remember it's always ok to seek help guys 🙏 No matter how troublesome, your life is more precious!! There are always people who care about you so stay strong for them and for yourself."
":( Always found it stupid that unfortunate ""Singaporean Citizens"" who spent a couple of years in Singapore or none at all have to serve for two years."
hai. society these days. need to really look out for one another.
I hope they pay more attention to the mental well being of the men. Especially in training and how they interact with the recruits. Instructors sometimes are being sadistic and seems to be playing a role of the bad guy. Instead actually being an instructor. I believe the instructor should have a more proper training on how to be an instructor as they are one of the people who should notice that this people needs help as they interact with them almost everyday.
"Fucking ridiculous.So our country forced an innocent dude who was for all intents and purposes a Pakistani to serve NS for a country he doesn't identify with, and his commanders didn't bother to pay extra attention to how badly it fucks him up?How are those fucks not charged for manslaughter yet?"

Hi guys would like to check if yall have experiences with taking a cruise (for 2 person) and how much would it roughly be at around April to May? Would want to hear about your experiences before booking. Thank you:)
"There's the natas fair at expo this weekend that you might want to check it out. Prices depend on the sale being offered.Personally I prefer the royal Caribbean brand because everything is included unless you go for more special foods and they have a 24hr cafe so that you won't go hungry. I mean everything is paid for. There is so much to do in terms of activities.. Parties kinda stop at around 12 but if you want more, there's a club in it. But club being happening depends on the passengers on the cruise. Just had a girls trip with my bestie and we had a blast.As compared to Dream cruise, you have to queue for everything for a ticket including shows and they only provide you with 3 meals a day. It is more of a gambling cruise.Because I had so much fun on the cruise with my bestie, now I want to go again despite just landing on Friday. Feel that life is so mundane and boring. Having SERIOUS withdrawal symptoms right now."
Omg thank you for your reply! Will check out royal carribean. Will not be able to make it down for the fair this weekend but hope that there will be a good deal on their site as well:) roughly how much did you pay per pax for the cruise you just went on?
Seriously depending on the package or offers and the season.
"Check the pricing on website. Usually book earlier better. Watch out of additional stuff like land tours which can add up if you decide to take.Other than that. If you decide to not drink and enjoy all the on board stuff, everything is in. Buffet breakfast is always the bomb."
I did! But I wanted to get opinions on which cruise is better from personal experiences :)
Royal Caribbean was great for me :)
"This will probably be buried, but I'm a history undergraduate from NUS who has completed basic & intermediate python data analytics. I'm looking to break into the private sector, preferably something in data analytics or research. does anyone have any advice or can offer any help? internships in these two sectors tend to exclude history degrees, which is why I'm looking for some advice."
"Hackwagon I suppose?Anyways, start a github account, archive all your projects and use it as your portfolio later on :)"
"yes, haha. concluding my DS102 class tomorrow. oh that's great, had no idea github was capable of that. will look into that too! thank you"
Hello. I highly suggest getting basics of computer science right. Sign up for CS50 now. Google is ur friend.
CS50? the EdX course?
Yes sir.
"ah great. hope you don't mind, but I looked at your longer comment to someone else about the same topic. I understand your logic for this! will definitely enrol to get the idea."
Great. I knew you would find it. :D
Build a portfolio? You can use data.gov as a starting point.
yes! am doing that now. any other recommendations on what else can I do?
"Write about the project. The data you worked with. Why? You chose it?Essentially, write a short story including your thought process. Was there a problem you wanted to look into more? What difficulties did you face? How did you overcome them? What limitations does your analysis (and visualization or maybe just a well written report) have?Quality over quantity i guess."
so it’s been around 3 weeks since I first got my braces and my lower right jaw has been hurting for 2 weeks. It hurts whenever I try to open my mouth wide/chew and idk is it related to braces but I didn’t exp jaw pain before I got my braces. I tried googling and it says I might have TMJ but I’m not sure if that’s the case? Does anyone w braces/had braces before experienced jaw pain as well?
"What is TMJ? It’s very normal to experience any kind of pain with braces. It goes away after awhile (and sometimes, a long while)."
Anyone using TPG trial sim card currently? How come i cannot make outgoing calls or receive incoming calls? My mobile data is alright tho.
Don't think their phone calls are up yet. Sms and Internet calls via WhatsApp works fine.
Your phone has to support VoLTE and TPG has to support your device. This information is on their website.
the damn haze smell is back
There’s a haze smell right?
"With Anthem official release, and me reading and watching reviews; apparently its a light theme-park that gives you epilepsy every minute, and is filled with loading screens, bugs, repetitive gameplay, crappy content.RIP to all those who bought it."
"not really, i enjoying the farming process lol"
u mean destiny 3? lmao
To be fair even vanilla Destiny was much better than AnthemEA BAD
Does anyone else notice a burning smell/haze?
yes
"Was buying sushi yesterday and the line for it was really long. This mother of 3 clearly distressed, was trying to convince her young son that she had already bought enough and was going to pay. Her young daughter was sitting nearby, while her eldest son around the age of 10 /11 was in the Q.The younger son was making a ruckus about wanting something else, so the mother attended to him. The eldest son was holding the spot in the Q, he was shoving an elderly lady and arguing with her.This made me think of how a mother had to juggle between her 3 kids and also how she's probably exhausted too. The kid was pretty rude, but who can we blame? The mom? The dad? The kid?"
and my gf still want 3 kids. wtf wrong with her...
"Why do we even need to blame anybody in the first place?I was reading up on punitive vs non-punitive cultures (at work). Here is an interesting quote I saw:""The next time your team falls short, don’t look for blame but instead, look for areas where you can help."""
"Work is different from.family and child upbringing.At work you are part of the team. Team shine you shine together.In the same company, cross department can assist and company as a whole shine.What do another family's problem have to do with me apart from being a disturbance in this case?Harsh and brutal but truth."
"There are a few stories of how strangers came to the aid of distraught parents.Three random strangers help mom struggling with toddlers at airportOne mom was struggling with two screaming toddlers and handling all the kids' carry-on in the airport queue.A total stranger gave up her place in the queue to let the mom go first.A second stranger helped the mom to carry all their stuff to the gate.A third stranger helped to carry and calm the screaming toddler for the rest of the flight.How a simple act of kindness saved a crying pregnant momA pregnant mom was struggling with a kicking and screaming toddler who was lying on the ground.The first stranger tried to calm down the kid by singing to him.The second stranger tried to pacify the kid with a peeled orange.The third stranger gave a toy to the kid to play with.A fourth stranger gave a bottle of water to the exhausted mother.A fifth stranger got the sippy cup from the mother's bag and gave it to the kid.Stranger Comforts Exhausted Mother’s Fussy Baby On FlightA tired pregnant woman was flying with an upset and fussy toddler. A stranger got up and offered to carry the kid for the mother because he was a parent too and he wanted the woman to have a rest. The stranger walked the plane aisle carrying and comforting the kid the entire flight.Mother reunited with stranger who helped calm her kids during flight thanks to Facebook appealA mother with two kids was boarding a plane when both her four-month-old baby and 3-year-old daughter started screaming. A stranger sitting next to her offered to help out the desperate mom by holding the baby. The stranger ended up helping the mother for the entire flight (and the next connecting flight) by keeping the kids distracted with conversation, colouring and movie watching."
"There is absolutely nothing wrong with strangers helping strangers.Your example is a good one where clearly the mother was in need. One may still argue that she should have hired help if what she's trying to handle is beyond her means.In the OP case, it was clear that the child is not a toddler. (11 years old.)Old enough to be disciplined sternly.Old enough to be caned at home. I strongly believe in carrot and stick system.Old enough to understand what is right and wrong.Add to the fact, the mother is not really struggling with a lot of other stuffs.She is only choosing stuff while son was in the queue.Son throwing tantrum and mum unable to control. This is in my opinion different from toddlers screaming although to me it is still nuiscience but at least i understand the difference between toddler and 11 YO.So I stand by my point that the mother in this case did not do sufficient based on info available in OP.I suspect it is due to the way they have bought up the kid leading to the current uncontrollable situation.It could also be that the mother might feel embrassed to handle the situation and by apologizing makes herself more visible. This is actually more common than we think.People fear apologizing, not because they do not think that they wrong but that by acknowledging, it brings more attention.Again, it is a nice thing. Stranger helping strangers. I jhave done so myself but sadly time and space do not always allows it.In this particular case, would it help if i smack the kid and call him a nuisance.What kind of help is needed? The kid is just throwing a tantrum saying he wants this.Maybe by offering money? But that is assuming the mother no money which is negative for her.In this particular case, i would help by telling both the kid and the mum off for bumping into the elderly.That would how a strnager can best help if they don't even understand this."
"Well, that is your perspective and I respect it. I do not think you need to justify your stance. There is no need to.I think everybody have their own reasons.What I am offering is just another perspective that people can consider when they encounter a situation like this again."
"You explained your perspective. I didn't feel that you were disrespecting mine.I am explaining mine. By explaining myself, I am not disrespecting your perspective.There isn't a need to justify.Like i mention, I do help strangers. But i judge whether they should be helped first.In OP example, I will be helping the elderly. Not the mother or the kid.As for the point on reasons. I agree. But its still up to the audience to think and decide whether to help.Let me give you an example.Someone begs for money to buy food.Someone who does not think at all will just give some money.But in our society, we have somehow been ""train"" to doubt it.Why is this so? It's perspective.Both yours and mine perspective are correct. It is just different."

"I really wish life could be a lot simpler.. but then again, I think I’m too afraid of taking the first time towards making it so."

Did anyone see the awesome array of fireworks just now behind Yew tee mrt?Brings back lots of memories for me - missed those days when she and I were tgt admiring fireworks during the NDP rehearsal periods last year
There was quite a bit of fireworks coming from jb side. Managed to get quite a show from Woodlands waterfront
"Then exercise more. Seriously if ur life is super active.. Like more than 20k steps a day, you can get slimmer."
"I floss and brush my teeth around half hour after my dinner. I find flossing a bother, so the thought of having to floss again is enough to stop me from snacking.I also started keeping a small section in my journal making notes the moment I felt like eating. That really helped me be more aware of when I'm falling back to emotional eating. Maybe when you feel like snacking, take a moment to think about what led to this urge. That's what worked for me."
Drink water instead of snacking.
"Substitute snacks with healthier choices, e.g. fresh/dried fruits, water, nuts etc.?"
"Refusing to take escalators anymore has helped me maintain my weight, at least. Even going up to my house on the twelfth floor isn’t too bad once I got used to it."
"Trying to stop snacking cold tends to be damn hard, so I'd suggest giving yourself some form of motivation not to snack.Sounds even more difficult and somewhat counter-intuitive, but for me, exercise is the way to go. How it works for me: exercise --> lost abit of weight --> have cravings for snacks --> remember the amount of hard work during exercise --> feel less compelled to eat snacks and waste the work. Or I feel guilty if I do snack and go for a run the next day.If you're not an active person, just start small like walking alot. Doesn't need to be hardcore cardio/gym sessions, just work activity into your life. If you're alr doing sports regularly, then I'd suggest trying to keep those snacks out of sight/easy reach."
I don't normally eat snacks but recently I just discovered Pringles Tortilla chips. Dayum those things are addictive.
Stop trying to tempt me you devil 😭

"So heres the thing. I like to 3d print stuffs, and during my poly days I used to 3d print ships. I made 3d models for the Navy's LMV and Formidable class frigates. They're not really EXACT replicas in the sense that I don't have the skills to replicate them. In doubt whether I should put it up for sale on Carousell or not. On one hand I'd like to make some money, on the other hand I'm afraid the other party will be expecting too much from an amateur... Has anyone ever tried putting their own 3d prints for sale ? I know this is a rather niche area but thanks to anyone who replies :)"
"Just list it with pics and see if anyone wants it, no harm in trying! And there's novelty value in what you are doing."
Is it normal to have friends that you don't text/contact actively to suddenly call/text you to ask how did you do for A levels? 3 of my secondary school friends just did that.
"Imagine having these friends to suddenly contact you for some ""business opportunity"" instead"
"Eh brudder, you free want to grab coffee sometime?"
"Depends. Could be they just wanna compare against you. Or they have been meaning to make contact but dunno how, so use this as an opportunity to start a convo"
I had a primary school friend ask me which university I was applying for back in 2013. We talked a bit but she just disappeared once again.
I will be thankful that they did not forget that we are friends haha.
"Either they still cherish you as a friend, or they wanna gauge their own results against yours as bragging rights or something."

What to do if you feel like an outcast in class/social life?
"If you are outcast/left out for reasons other than cause you are a nasty person etc, I think that's just fine, some of us are just too different. Don't take it to heart. Accept that mainstream social life isn't for you, and enjoy the many other parts of life. I know people who do that just fine. They even found friends who are just as different as them through hobbies or chance.Some would argue that there are material benefits to being sociable and having lots of acquaintances. For one, its better for your career if you don't get outcast in your job. You then have to decide if these benefits are worth faking it for. I'd say you can do fine by yourself, basing off some of my anti social friends, but its really something you must decide for yourself."
"i feel like you gotta understand sometimes you dont click with people, people have different interest or you may be different from them.if your concern is how they think of you, ask yourself does it really matter? if you're trying to fit in, ask yourself, do you have to?society might conform you to act or be this way at this age, but in grand scale of things honestly it doesnt matter, at least to me. so really i just do whatever i want even if ill be or feel outcasted."
Вы говорите по-русский?
Nope
I am a clown at sociable events to try to prevent awkward silences at the expense of my own comfort. Got labelled as outgoing or to as one of those to lead social gatherings.They drain me extremely fast. But feel my efforts make the events better. I'm okay with doing that. Both sides are me. They know it too.Used to be really shy and quiet otherwise.
learn how to act. sometimes you gotta craft the personality you never had. be socialable in public but be yourself in private.
"Just spent 30 minutes trying to swallow a tablet lol.I can swallow capsules fine, but tablets, urgh. They don't float on water so I can't trick my brain into thinking it's not in my mouth."
"Hmm I read somewhere that looking down, not tilting your head back, is the easiest way to swallow it, but not sure if it’s true! Maybe you can give it a try"
"Yea, it's what I do to swallow capsules, since the capsules float so I wouldn't feel it swimming. But tablets are denser than water so they just sink right down onto my tongue"
"I have a very strong gag reflex so my first time learning how to overcome it and swallow tablets involved lots of near-vomits. When I finally did it, I grabbed my stomach instinctively. That became part of my muscle memory; now whenever I swallow them I have to grab my stomach. Someone saw me doing it once and thought I had stomach pain 😂"
"I can swallow pills without waterTechnically still need water cos I just gather some saliva, swirl swirl abit with my tongue , then swallow that saliva+pill mixtureMight take a while to reach my tummy but swallow more saliva helps"
"Drink some water first so that it doesn't stick to your tongue, then eat the tablet, drink more water, tilt your head back and swallow. I find the tilt head back and swallow technique works even if I have to dry swallow my tablets, and they're pretty big."
"I usually try to eat my tablets along with other food! makes things so much easier.e.g. if I'm eating chips, I'd put a few chips in my mouth and chew. after chewing for a while I put the tablet into the bolus and swallow my food together with the tablet.you can't feel anything at all!! unless the tablet is super huge of course, but then again it's still really easy to swallow"
Yes!! I second this. #idothiseverytime
"That’s not really the most effective way to swallow medicine, you should place it at the back of your mouth then drink water as normal, it’ll go down just fine.I’ve used to have trouble swallowing any capsules and tablets too, but I’ve already mastered this technique and it has been a lot easier."
Whenever I can feel the tablet I will hesitate to swallow. Normally I use the forward head tilt but for tablets it doesn't work well.
"I have lots of trouble with that myself! Especially half tablets (need to cut) and there are somewhat sharp edges so you can feel them going down...These days if I'm prescribed tablets, the first question to ask is always whether I can crush them to make it easier to swallow."
Anyone know how much is the TP test for ssdc?

Does anyone know if donating blood will get my blood tested?Or should I go polyclinic? I want to find out what's wrong with my body lately
Should just go polyclinic or private GP with your symptoms. The doctor can advise what tests (blood or otherwise) depending on your symptoms and health history.
"There is no blood test during donation, but they will test it for storage. If they find out anything wrong with your blood, they can take legal action against you.There will be a warning on the piece of paper you sign during donation."
"pls don't donate blood to get a blood test as this takes away precious resource (money, time and actual blood donated) from blood banks. just pony up the cash and go polyclinic for blood test."
I didn't realize that my methodology was so wrong. My neighbour shouldn't have offered that suggestion to encourage me to donate
Perhaps you should let that neighbour know that is a jerk move.
"for blood donation, they will screen your blood before using it.. if your blood is not usable, they will notify you..but pls go to the polyclinic to ask for a blood test if you think there is smth wrong w your body!"
Go to a polyclinic and request for a blood test.

Haha been sick of seeing our sg teams losing to them. A very welcomed change to see Albirex lose.
I know right.. do you support any singaporean clubs?
"Bought an airticket to Munich to Singapore for 974 dollars with a stopover at Heathrow for 1h 10mins. Is it considered cheap? Also, anyone has any idea if ISIC card is useful around Europe?"
I've seen isic card student discounts at some museums in europe
"Good luck. Heathrow is huge, and 1hr 10mins connecting usually means you need to start boarding at the 40min mark?Make sure your seat is near the door and your hand carry has enough clothes. Cos chances of your luggage not making the connecting flight is very likely.ISIC is useful if got student deals la, but then if they not anal, your Sg student card works also."
"Heathrow quite big ah, make sure your stopover is in the same terminal and don’t dally about after you alight. Grab someone to ask if your connecting gate is near"
Careful with that stopover if it's not the same aircraft.
Thank you!
"Yup. Try get seats as close to the exit door (if economy it's usually going to be door L2 -- the second door from the front on the left) on the plane to Heathrow, and since it's Heathrow... fucking run the moment you get off. Do not wait for anything on the plane, get your shit ready the moment it comes to a halt and get out once doors open. Just kiasu your way out of there.I am praying you got a flight that's on-time if not that 1h 10 min is reduced further. Heathrow is huge, no time to do anything along the way either (no toilet, nothing). That 70 min is probably going to become 50 given that Heathrow is not always free with parking slots for your inbound plane.Good luck."
Does it matter? People normally ask before buying. You ask after buying???
You could've helped with the ISIC card. Thanks for your valuable input.
No problem. My input was as valuable as your question
Today walking on the road keep got people staring at me dunno why leh. No zip to be unzipped also.

Neither. If that's the case this would be a frequent thing and I'd be used to it already .
"Okay so, I just realised after checking my e-statements that I have been charged $2.99 by Amazon Prime since September last year. Thing is, I don't remember ever signing up for any of their paid services. However, I still do have an account though. So I went into the account settings to check just in case but it says that I do not have any memberships or subscriptions to any of their services. Could this mean that someone else had gotten hold of my card details and used it for their own?"
Have you ever used Amazon Prime Now? The subscription is separate from Amazon Prime (which isn’t available in SG). You should check your subscription in the Prime Now app.
Contact Amazon and inform them lor
"okay, think I will call the bank too and report"
IMO better to wait for Amazon to confirm if it's being wrongly charged or if there's an active subscription. Big hassle to deal with the banks since you have to talk over the phone for pretty much anything. Only if Amazon confirms there's an active subscription that you may want to consider checking in with the bank.
"oh okay then I'll do that first, thanks!"

What's the best way to find an internship if I have no work experience? First year in uni now and dun rlly know what I want to do
Search on glints.sg for internship opportunities.
Talk to yr family members for recommendations den move to seniors
"I am not too sure about yours, or is it a professional internship which is part of the curriculum.If it is part of the curriculum, you can apply via the school portal. They have a list of potential company that you can apply. Usually the company already expressed interest to hire interns, so it is more about waiting for them to choose you.If you are talking about ordinary internships, i would say majority of the time they wouldnt mind your job experience since it is cheap labour."
Email and call all of them! Keep trying and don't give up.
mass cold call all the places you want to intern at
Ö this rlly works? I thought about it but figured that they probably won't entertain me lol. Does emailing their HR department work too?
Yes. Source: cold called and got internship before
"Hi guise, any recommendations for cafes in the east side?"

Hopefully that Tiong Bahru Bakery is in the east and not in Tiong Bahru haha.
"I bought Irvins Salted Egg in a stall in Lucky Plaza. After I bought it, the seller said that I can get a free sim just by letting them scan my passport. I obliged so they gave me the sim. Was that legit? or am I in big trouble? :("
"Is the SIM usable? It is required by law when registering a new SIM card to have a valid form of identification, most likely the info is sent to the telco"
Oh so most probably they'll send my info to the telco? Actually he offered to put the sim into my phone but I humbly declined because my sim port is problematic. So I'm quite confident it's usable.
"Yes, when they register for a new SIM (no identification = no SIM card), your passport (or other valid forms of identification) will be scanned and forwarded to the telco, of course if you're feeling uncomfortable with the process, just approach them again, I'm sure they'll be happy to divulge the process."
"Thanks a lot. Such a relief. We had a good talk with the guy which made it hard for me to refuse his offer. Also, I trust Singaporeans. Thank you!"
Lol. Did you really need that sim card.
Not really. But it sounded that he was kind enough to offer. I actually bought in his store amounting to 40$ so I was thinking he's doing that in return.
but why passport? I don't mind them scanning my NRIC as it shows that I have already claimed my sim card and not being a cheapskate of trying to get another one.
I forgot to say that I'm a tourist. Was that legit? Kinda scared if my info might be misused.
"a discussion between friends sparked this quirky 'dilemma'. Would you ratherknow that ghosts exist and be always able to see and interact with them (and vice versa) ornot know whether ghosts exists or not, and live with a 5% chance(for each unique ghost you meet) that you may be able to see and interact with them(if they even exist) and vice versa?for the purpose of this, we dont know what ghosts are: they can range from casper the friendly ghost variety to birdbox esque beings. and also disregard religion"
Obviously 1! I mean I was still anxiously awaiting my letter to Hogwarts in sec school!

Not know whether ghosts exist or not. Otherwise you kinda have to deal with the grievances of the ghosts and such. At least that is what I observe from watching dramas haha.
"Took a Gojek ride with my friends today. It was from Sentosa and it was quite hard for the driver (old man) to locate our pick up location.. So when he reached we thought he looked angry. At the end of the ride, he asked us “Are you all still students ?” We said yes, wondering why he asked. Then he told us to just pay $10 instead of $18 for the ride (mind you it was a 30 minute ride from Sentosa to Yishun). We were touched because he’s so nice ? We rejected his offer in the end tho hahah.Just wanted to share this small little happy news cause it made me and my friends’ day :’) And also not to judge people by their face lmao"
I don’t use Gojek so idk if u can rate the driver/give feedbacks but if u can do it!! The driver will be very touched :’)edit:spelling
this is heartwarming :”)

"So I've watched Larry Charles' ""Dangerous World of Comedy"" and I've just found out there are international wannabes versions of the ""Daily Show"". Singapore is included and it's on one of MediaCorps' channels.Does anyone here know what show that is?"
I think that is a scene from The Noose.
"Yeah, that's the show! Thanks!"
"you found it baby, youre on r/Singapore on reddit"
Wait isn't it the US version of the Daily Show that's screened here?
"Yes, there is, but I'm surprised MediaCorps have their own unofficial version of Daily Show."
The Noose is not quite The Daily Show.
It certainly is nowhere near as daring
The purpose is also pretty different. The Noose is formatted like UK humour I find instead of US

Luna is found! Thanks everyone case closed:)
Woohoo!
Ay grats
Nice!!
Glad to hear! :)
Give that good boy a pet for me
How/where was he found?
Also maybe post a pic of that good doggo :)
The unpuffiest Shiba I've ever seen.
"Haha was about to say, this shiba doesn't look very doge-like"
Its really adorable tho
Guess it's the humidity of our beloved nation 👏👏
"This is the most well-designed wanted poster I've ever seen, owner must really miss him"
help this doge.1 Doge = 1 Doge!
why is he so skinny :(
He looks fine. Most likely heavily trimmed to avoid him overheating in our climate
Wish I could help but I love on the other side of Singapore
Pet and Protecc
Looks really skinny for a Shiba too!
Yes! The pupper is found.
if its chipped then why cant we track it
"Because a chip is not a GPS system with a powerful radio attached. The pellet-sized “chip” injected into the dog is simply too small for anything but RFID, and the range for that is really short.Entire governments would have killed to have that tech, if it was possible."
Sounds like one of the Black Mirror episodes
"yeah, ark angel"
he looks so skinny
Hey I live there.
OK
OK
I think no hope as someone last spotted the dog near a Korean BBQ restaurant.

oh my god I still have six of these at home
Think i still have a whole bunch of these :p
"I got annoyed by this because I really liked them, but the more you play with them, the more they cracked because of the crap plastic they use."
"Really? I thought the plastic was relatively good quality, didnt experience any cracks with mine😂"
All my official beanz cracked.The off-brand replica beans held abuse well. Even tossed them like a ball and landed on the floor regularly eith no problem.
Mine has a big crack on my mega bean
Yeahhh. Collecting and stunting didn’t go well... you’d scratch em up and they didn’t look nice anymore.
I still dont get the point of it
"It's basically TCG model (booster packs, rarity and all that) except you can't do shit with the beans other than roll it aroundIt's more of a pet's toy than anything tbh.Also I guess collectors want something to collect?"
I rather spend my money on DUEL MASTERS dun dun dun dun
All I remember about is how my primary school bans this and always appear on those prohibited item list.
Omg yes I have the glow in the dark ones too!!
Omg yes!! They’re super rare beans iirc. Never managed to get any of those tho :(
Anyone remember the name of those stinky toys? Around the same time as this. Sold in 711
Stink blasters!
I have a mild recollection that the first generation of these actually has a bug inside jumping on its own. Anyone can confirm?
"No la, inside is a metal ball"
You're thinking of Mexican jumping beans! It's a different thing :)
You're thinking of Mexican jumping beans. Those are literally beans with a larval moth in it that jump when heated.
I still have some of this lying around somewhere
Let's show case the mighty beanz we have! See who got more. Lol
lol it came back
I still have my badly damaged moose mighty bean with me!
I remember the first generation that had a red race track.
Dont remember them being so fat
Had a glo in the dark mighty beanz. Coolest kid in da blocc
"Wow please become a fad again. Then I can sell my vintage beans HEHEHEAlso, the current beans are fugly really compared to 1st gen"
"Went yesterday, portion definitely not as shown in the promo video here."
Oh man.. sad to hear of this.. RIP
Woah. This is sad. That poor young student. Probably too stressed. RIP.
another young life gone like tat.

Does anyone have experience with expat medical insurance that covers maternity? My wife and I are exploring different options and we found a package from Now Health Sompo that would suit our needs on paper.I did a bit of googling and found mixed reviews. Is this a reliable insurance company?
"Any insurance that comes with maternity coverage will have a waiting period before they'll pay out (from what I've seen, 10 months to 2 years). I used BUPA, purchased through Expat Insurance; it was good but expensive."
"No experience with that company but have used expat insurance before, and they were very good."
We had a very positive experience with Sompo maternity cover overall. The coverage was very good and claims were easy to raise and process.
"Some insurers have bad reviews because consumers are not happy that their claims are being declined,even though (for medical insurance) it could be because of a pre existing condition or other standard policy exclusion that they weren't aware about. I'm insured under now health and I haven't had any issues claiming. It's also common for individual policies to have waiting periods for maternity."
Thanks everyone! Seems like there's no reason not to go for it!
"Recently multiple suicides have received substantial publicity in the mainstream press, and the media has generally often reported on such tragedies.Studies show that publicings suicides are linked spikes in the rate and often cause copy-cat incidents.Given this, should current media practices regarding suicide reporting be changes?https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/media-spotlight/201605/can-celebrity-suicides-lead-copycat-deaths"
"There are 100s of suicides every year. Maybe only a few dozen are discussed anywhere, whether on the state-controlled media or on online outlets. Unlike what you suggest, most are not publicised.2017: 361 reported suicides.2016: 429."
I wonder how they choose when a suicide makes the news then.
Two specific categories of suicides that seem to be reported are:In SAF camp (will be reported by MINDEF and so picked up).Academic-related (of special interest to many Singaporeans).
"I think if the suicide reflects certain social problems that are worthy to be discussed, like when kids kill themselves because they got bad grades."
"I think it is a double edge sword. Yes it can inspire people to mimic suicide methods, but it can also create awareness in suicide incidents. Parents who read such news will pay more attention to their love ones, so yes i am up for such news to be published to the public. Of course it might be uncomfortable for the victim family members.Think of it this way, ever seen the scam advertisement? It is the same thing, while it promotes the idea of scam, it also educate the public to avoid such scam incident."
The SAF will be accused of cover up if they don't. I think the public has the right to know such cases.
Eh our press usually does unless it's damn horrific (eg: a whole family killed themselves)
"Such studies, like the one you cited, show a spike in copycat suicides during a period of intense media coverage of a well-known and well-loved celebrity like Robin Williams.This is inherently different from the usually short-lived news of suicides committed by a few random individuals.Many years ago, hardly any suicides were publicised, but it didn’t stop the rise of suicides in Singapore as mental, financial, health and societal pressures grew.As it is, not all suicides are publicised. Many still die without a blurb in the papers.If we attempt to sweep all suicides under the rug and keep the population ill informed about mental health challenges, struggles and the need to look out for each other - that would have a more devastating and isolating effect."
"LOL you don't know how many suicide cases are not published. it's just like people think that Singapore is safe, police are very free but it's not. the cases are just not published"
What metrics or evidence do you have to suggest Singapore is not safe ? Compared to virtually any other major city or country with the possible exception of Japan?
North Korea has an even lower crime rate
"'Singapore is safe, police are very free' comes as a package lah. I'm not saying sg is unsafe it's that most people, may or may not include you, don't see nor know about the dark side of sg. evidence is OSA can't share about it if not will kenna charge bro"
There's actually a lot more suicides reported in the Chinese papers than English ones.
Plot twist... The guy is not interested in either of them.
The guy is gay and had a threesome with the brothers of both girls.
They poured liquids over each other. Kerosene? Hydrochloric acid?? Water???

"Hi, a fellow student looking for help here for my history project writeup. So far, I have managed to write out the Social, Economic and Political impact on the Japanese Occupation. However, I cannot find any info regarding the overall impact of the Japanese Occupation on SG. Would any kind soul help me out?Sorry for formatting, on mobile.llEDIT: thanks for all the advice guys! I'm gg to library tmr 2 borrow some books"
"Have you tried Google? Would be far more useful than Reddit lolBut overall I would say that politically, the Japanese simply continued the British’s divide and rule policies (though of course unlike the British, they were particularly repressive against the Chinese). Economic-wise, the Japanese exploited Malaya’s raw materials (esp rubber and tin) for its war efforts."
"Tried google, but their suggested doesn’t fit what the writeup’s requirements ;-;"
"Go to the library and borrow these books:The Japanese occupation of Malaya and Singapore, 1941-45 : a social and economic history / Paul H. Kratoska.A sudden rampage : the Japanese occupation of Southeast Asia, 1941-1945 / Nicholas Tarling.Southeast Asia under Japanese occupation / Alfred W. McCoy, editor."
Thank you!
"I can only offer a general hearsay, with some truth in it.In the early 1960s, when Singapore was removed from Malaysia, the govt positioned Singapore as a good place for business. As part of war reparations, Japanese companies did the land reclamation in East Coast. This was also when Japan was experiencing the economic miracle, of high industrial and economic growth.As part of Singapore plan for economic growth, the govt reached out to Japanese for economic cooperation. This is a factor why the Japanese Occupation here was downplayed compared to other countries. And partly might be the reason why it was called an Occupation in English. Memorial services for the war dead at the Civilian War Memorial was also more quiet and low key."
You should visit the Singapore History Gallery at the National Museum!I’ve lived abroad for many years now and visited for the first time in January in 8 years. I just love and appreciate how most museums are free for Singapore citizens (wish that was the case for me as a tourist). The occupation is covered quite extensively so consider making a trip there. Seeing video footage and artifacts from that time period is stunning.
R/history may have some gems for u too
"What is the level of education you are taking? Although considering you’re asking on Reddit instead of researching, I assume secondary school? If so perhaps you can refer to Social Studies textbooks."
"Yea, I'm in sec schl ;_;"
"Social Studies textbooks (or whatever resources you use for your lessons) should be enough for your project then? It should have answers which are more expected by your teacher.Unless this is some kind of research project, then you might want to borrow some books etc."
"I watched the LKY play, and a question came to mind.What if we didn't get invaded by the Japanese? We'd still be a British colony, and 2nd class citizens in our land of birth.Good tangent to explore imo."
Uhhh I think the british would have probably left on their own by now.
They were weakened by WWII which is why they reduced their presence globally.Why else leave a gold mine?
They would have been weakened by war in europe whether or not Singapore was invaded.A cultural shift away from colonialism. Economic challenges and the rise of the US. Most importantly democratisation. I don't think the UK could embrace democracy at home while denying self rule to the colonies. Nor would there be much democratic support for colonialism in its pre ww2 form. At worst we might have a canada/australia type situation with the queen as head of state but effective independence.
"After the war, the British public was not in the mood to continue maintaining the empire - the war had cut them down to size, the public and Clement Atlee wanted to build the welfare State and the NHS and leaders from colonies had become politically and PR savvy.The UK would have gradually exited all the colonies of significance."
"Even if we weren't invaded by the Japanese, the fact they got their butt handed to them in SE Asia already sparked the call for various countries to seek independence from the British. It would've happened to Singapore sooner or later."
Got their butt handed by whom? (The Japanese and that's my point)
you should visit old folks home and look for the last reminding survivors and talk to them and record their oral history
National Service
"Actually, the British had conscription or national service during colonial times. One of my ex-expat teachers in JC who was a UK citizen first came to Singapore as a conscript. Would not be surprised that National Service is one of the many institutions such as Parliamentary system and the Civil Service that Singapore inherited from the British Colonial Government. Arguably, the Japanese Occupation drove home the message that for an independent country, you needed to protect your own sovereignty through military defence or else be a vassal to whoever had the bigger proverbial stick in the neighbourhood."
Don’t know why you’re being downvoted; the British not being able to defend SG in WW2 is definitely one of the reasons why we need to be able to defend ourselves
"Exactly what I'm thinking given that total defence day was not long ago.As the years pass, people grow old and die, generations come and go. The emotional trauma part slowly gets forgotten. NS however stays with us (and is therefore, in a sense, the longest lasting, most general impact)"
"Honestly, if you think a bunch of conscripts could have won against a well-trained force that rampaged through China and swiftly moved down SE Asia, you must be living in magical christmasland.Also, there was no ""ourselves"" then. We were pretty much part of the Empire, and the British were outmaneuvered throughout the whole Malayan peninsular."
I wonder how the Malayan crisis would have been resolved if the British had never faced the Japanese.

"Greet the cleaners at your block/at work. They appreciate not being invisible.Edit: How someone else made me happier too. An elderly man exercising/walking his small dog likewise said hello to me and made small talks with me when I kept looking at his dog on my way home. Some people dislike small talks, but to me a little social interactions are nice. The overall friendly vibes from people go a long way."
"I always greet them with a slight nod, even at work/study. I hope you do it too!They always have it tough and it really sucks...On the bright side, when I was in school and NS, the head of the organization always organised a hong bao gifting and appreciation service for them and if by some chance I do rise to such a position, I'll do it too!"
I try to strike small talks but I find it very difficult for me. Usually greet them good morning especially the cleaner lady at work. Once heard her grumbled people treated her as invisible and it was sad to hear.
"If you have extra food, offer to them and insist that they have it (unless it goes against dietary restrictions). Do this whenever you have extras and I guarantee you they will remember for life."
A slight nod is not a greeting. Say hello and ask how they’re doing.
My cleaner always greets me (before I can greet her) and I rush to work some days and wonder what I can do more in return. This helplessness eats me sometimes.
Make small talks or offer a coffee? Some times they want more interactions especially for those who work alone.
"Asking how they are and whether they have eaten always works. Plus, if you have extra food, offer to them and insist that they have it (unless it goes against dietary restrictions). Do this whenever you have extras and I guarantee you they will remember for life."
"Except when you see them, they trying to shortcut their work.fuckers always sweep rubbish onto the road to make the street look clean, then snap a photo of their""job well done"" to send to their sup, then walks off and takes a smoke.Takes about 3 minutes for their actual sweeping.And yeah I complained before, their replacement staff does the same thing.Beauty World's cleaners also like that, but I don't bother anymore.edit: town council sweepers ^My work janitors are cute ahkong and ahmas"

"Each day when you commute to work, greet the bus drivers & thank them when you get off.Each time a postman delivers a parcel/letter, attend to them promptly & give them a smile.Each time you dine at a hawker center/food court, pay the cleaners a compliment when they clean up the table before you.Each time you see a cleaner on the street, it will bring no harm to stop by & thank them for their efforts.Volunteering to a cause is one way to give back, but true humility starts by showing kindness in the little things throughout our day-to-day life :)"
"Understood man. I try to do it though its always on and off. Sometimes, my mind is too occupied by work.I hope you can do it too, so we can collective make a change to improve this earth we were born into. :)"

"You’re very lovely for doing this :) (can I get a compliment please, I’m a needy baby needing affirmation)"
"Hi buddy, I think that even if the people around you do not say it, they think that deep down, you're a beautiful person who has the power to impact life if you just apply yourself in the right way!You're beautiful!"

"When i was young, my dad will lift me up off the ground and carry me around the block.Dad is gone though, and even if he still is, im a grown up already.

Use trolley?
":( I know how it feels, especially since my dad is really sick now. Even if he can't carry you, I'm sure you can go out with him, talk to him or even hug him if you try!Hopefully that gives you the urge to do it and feel happier!"
It's still pretty impressive for him to be able to carry a young sperm whale on his back.
Willing Hearts always needs some help to cook food!
"Hi, I checked out their website and their location is too far away from where I live... It takes about 90 minutes or so for me to get there and back. Do you happen to know of other charities that might need help?"
ah I'm not too sure. I'm not a volunteer person. It's just that willing Hearts really stood out for me!I think helping organizations directed at giving to the poor in direct ways(like food and groceries) are one of the most meaningful ways to give back to society.
You can try giving.sg! :D

It wouldn't if you change it to stevia hehehe. OMG you are way too nice and you enjoy the drinks! :) thank you for trying to make other people's day. What's would make your day?
"I'm not too sure what would make my day, seeing people become happier is already really heartening. It makes me feel full inside.Thanks for the offer though!P.S. Stevia is still just the lesser of two evils..."
"Wow, it's very nice of you to do this. It's def not easy as it may feel like some friends/people are just not appreciative/receptive to these things, but I believe in a notion of a more compassionate and kind society as well amidst the tough life/rat race. Nothing much for me, so I'll just wish you a great weekend ahead!"
Thank you!All the best to you and have a great weekend!
"Help someone each day ,dont tell anyone about it"
"Think of a positive experience from the last day for two minutes.Bullet-point every detail from the experience that you can remember in order to visualize and experience what happened.2. Spend two minutes a day finding three new things you are grateful for.This will train your brain to see things through a more optimistic lens.3. For two minutes, start work each day by writing a positive message thanking or praising someone you know.This will benefit both you and the person who receives your kind words.You can do just one of these two-minute exercises each day, or multiply their effectiveness by doing two or all three.By devoting a mere 120 seconds each day to boosting our happiness, we not only change the quality of our work, but we also dramatically change the course of our lives. That's truly powerful stuff."

"That's the way, record those items that spark joy :)It's not my system actually. I'm just sharing from Shawn Achor and his work the Happiness Advantage."
Dayum so many Step 1s
Need a friend to do volunteering because my friends arent interested in volunteering and to volunteer alone makes me have anxiety all the time 😞
"Buddy, I'll PM you."
as it happens i just needed to talk to someone just like this. thank you :)
I've pm you. :)
Buy a meal for an elderly/needy person at a food centre.
"Hi, I just finished my meal at the hawker centre near chinatown. I bought tissues from one who hung a certification of his disability.I find that better than just giving someone money, as it keeps their dignity and pride. I hope it helps."
"Facebook links are not allowed on this subreddit.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns."
You're such a nice person!!
"Hi, thanks for the compliment! You're a nice person too! :)In fact, the first who said such to me here haha.Have a nice day!"
May I said hi to you
Haha. Hi man. You gave me a smile on my face as it was quite unexpected/cute and I do hope you feel happier too. :)
"🤔 tell a person at work, “hey, thanks, you’re doing a great job”. In most of the right contexts, I’d think it’ll brighten anyone’s day."
"Sure thing man!Also, thanks, you're doing a great job!"
I want a better job and to be a better professional. Help!
"Hi inno7 (again),Currently, our SG Government has been having a strong focus on retraining and improving. They even subsidize it in the form of skillfuture!Moreover, they have workspace skills qualification program. I'm sure if you bring it up with your employer, you'll be given time off to partake in the initiative (the company is given compensation from the government for each employees who attend such a course!).http://www.ssg.gov.sg/wsq.html is a link for your reference :)The certification would surely help out with your job hunting prospects.Apart from those ""professional"" esq services, I'm sure moments of self contemplation as well as determination to work hard, reflect in productive, tangible, realistic, and timed manner would surely help you improve! The change would be noticeable to others from the outside!I hope I have helped."
I know someone who has insecurity/ego/temper issues. How can I help her? (Can’t do counseling etc.)
"Hi inno7,From my personal experience, directly confronting the issue with the person does not resolve the issue due to a cognitive dissonance. That is to say, they can recognize a certain trait in others but not themselves, stemming from a poor experience (resulting in an emotional response rather than a cognitive response) previously or a disconnect between expectation and reality.I personally was not helpful at all trying to resolve the issue in its earnest, though I found that positive reinforcement and a gradual shift in the context to make the person face reality helpful?I'm no clinical psychologist but that's my personal take on the issue. I'm sure its a case by case basis but I hope you might be able to find some insight in which is applicable and helpful in your journey with your friend.All the best! And do tell me if you're successful! Its always really heartening to hear ""success"" stories when you least expect it!"
"I personally feel that it matters more that a difference is made and society benefits rather than what I do. Volunteering is one of the ways but I think that even something small like this would help someone feel better about themselves and it would resonate with others. :)I really hope that in the future I'll be able to result in tangible, systematic change to help improve our society but its ultimately up to everyone."
"Hi there, when you wake up tmr, randomly head over to your mom and dad and hug them! Forgive me if u made the assumption that theyre still around!"
"Sure thing, but would you do it too? Spread the love and positivity!"
"Do you do photography? I'm a writer, and I would like to start a series of '' Humans in Singapore '' articles."
"I'm sorry, I don't do photography, though I'm sure you can find a lot of amateur photographers on instagram and amateur photography studios.Just have the guts to message them!"
Can you make Singapore’s temperature cooler? Hahaha.
"I'm sorry ._.I'm no genie...But they say in chinese that if you are calm, you'll feel cool :D"
What are you trying to do and what is the point of this
"I just wanted to cheer people up and make this subreddit more positive. Especially given how only negative posts were voted up recently...I always believe that if someone is happy, they will make others happy. If someone is angry, someone else will be angry."
PayLah me $1
"$25000 cash gift for me to pay off study loans, thanks. Don't need extra."
"Sorry man, I can't really help and I wish I have the cash to pay off my own issues...But maybe I can help you with your confidence in landing a good job (like how it takes confidence to ask a stranger for money so brazenly), and have assurance in your future!"
Give me back my pink ic.. Or help me find my 11b that I dropped. Both works
"Hey man, I just ord'ed recently. I know how you feel. So, buddy hang in there, the 2 years might seem tough and a real waste of time but I'm sure you'll be able to learn from it with a positive mental attitude.You could learnWhat kind of a person you do not want to be.FriendshipSocial skills especially interacting with those of a different social background.What's the right thing to do, from all the negative examples.Also, pm me your camp. If its the same camp I was from, I became good friends with the canteen owner and was always given a discount. Maybe I can hook you two up?"
I want to have dinner with friends...
"Buddy, pm me roughly where you live and when you are free. I'll make time for you. Maybe I'll treat you to some food at a hawker.Cheer up man!"
Me too..
Please PM me roughly where you live so I'll see if there's anywhere convenient to go out.
Send nudes
Are you gay though? Hmm
"There is a 50-50 chance on guessing your gender correctly (more broadly in a global context). No harm, no foul.Statistics can be a tricky field."
Ask the guy who i fell in love with to open up and text me back. 😞
"If you don't mind rejections, I don't mind helping you ask!I always feel that its better to suffer the pains of rejection now than let it dangle on and feel regret forever!Pm me if you want to talk about it, its always nice letting it off your chest."
Thank you. i msg him but it seems we meet at the wrong point of our lives.
That's a pity but I hope it helped you find closure and move on to another chapter of your life! All the best and I hope you meet someone that is just right for you!
thank you =)
Text him again. :)
=/ @yinyangpeng.. you compliment my 心碎的冰咖啡。
"Sorry, I am not gay... maybe try geylang?"
Give me gold lmao
I hear it take ALOT of money and powerful connections to set your kid up for F1.
Yup. Super a lot of sponsors and connections are needed.
I honestly think if that kid is F1 caliber all the GLCs will be pretty ready to pour money on him
Until MINDEF comes in to spoil the party
"But if he does reach F1, then I really think MINDEF will give him the deferment. One of the primary arguments against the footballer was that he was playing for a team and there was no glory for the country, which is not the case in F1 since the drivers flag is raised if they win. Plus pretty sure they'll froth at the mouth to have a Singaporean driver start a Singapore race. But then again this is all hypothetical and we'll never know till it happens."
Okay then Mindef is a cunt. Honestly if they are such cunts it's better to be a PR for sure.
pr also need to serve ns bro
Oh I meant that PRs can cancel their PRs and not have to serve if push comes to shove
So the solution to grant deferment to Ben Davies is to request he raise the Singapore flag when he wins.Easily done!
Need the penultimate high-SES for that.
Tbh timing and luck is the most impt to get you to F1.
"In modern F1? Honestly, money speaks. A lot. There's a reason why some not-as-good drivers have driven F1 cars for the past few years, even for teams that have history and success in the past. Lance Stroll is one great example. His dad literally saved the Force India team from going bankrupt or whatever it was, and just like that, he drives for the newly reborn Racing Point team in 2019."
"OTOH, a podium finish even before Hulkenberg got his... You need some talent after all. Pastor Maldonado is another example, and coincidentally also drove at Williams F1."
No respect
I'm 28 and I just got my driving license.
the cold hard truth
Pops better start thinking about his son's SG citizenship. 2 more years and the kid is stuck with NS.
Ironic if he makes it all the way to F1 and can't compete in the race in SG.
frfr...I really hope his father is already doing something about the NS issue.
immediately thought about this too. it's on his father to not screw it up
Other Singaporean kids that are racing overseas and doing well.Christian Ho Still kartingDaim Hishammudin F4 racer
"It's in the 8-13 years old category to be clear, but still an achievement nonetheless. Lots of F1 racers came from karting backgrounds as kids."
"""3RD TRANSPORT WANTS YOU!""SIGN ON NOW. BE THE FACE OF TRANSPORT OPERATORS."
ATTRACTIVE SALARY AND BENEFITS
His family better sort out the NS shit quick. Would hate for this kid to lose his chance just because of ns.
Run away boy! Run away and chase your dreams before you get defaulted! You'd still be considered a Singaporean achiever!
Happy cake day!
Would be a good driver in tekong for officer.
is there even money in carting?
Most f1 drivers start from carting.
"Addendum. Lewis Hamilton, started karting when he was eight. He won his Super One championship in 1998, when he was 13.Someone closer to home, Malaysian ex F1 driver Alex Yoong, started at 16.This kid, Tiziano, started with he was five and got podium at an international championship at nine. So he is on track to be a world class racer."
But Alex Yoong is the worst F1 driver ever according to my husband
"Most racing drivers including touring, rally and F1 started from karting"
It's the other way round. You spend a lot of money to go karting.
"Sad reality. Sure, there are many sports in which having a strong sponsor (eg your own parents) will help propel your career and rate of success. However, motorsports is almost overwhelmingly dependent on having such a sponsor. The cost of entry is high, from smaller things like racing accessories to every aspect of vehicle/equipment maintenance to even buying a racing seat in a team even if you’re good enough."
Joseph Schooling is a classic example. If he came from a low SES family he would probably never win an Olympic gold medal.
"Don’t compare with Joseph Schooling. Schooling’s parents struggled for years to scrape up enough money for his high level training, when he had already shown that he was way faster than the Singapore talent pool. In the beginning, swimming training costs nearly nothing and is accessible to everyone. Whereas this go kart boy’s father is an expat MD head of Asia in the finance industry and it would have cost a ton even when he first started. The Singapore go kart tracks only allow kids 9/10 and above to drive and the max speed is limited. This kid must have been training in a special car, special track."
"My point is, if Joseph Schooling's parents couldn't afford to fork out a million dollars for him to train in the US, he would never have won an Olympic medal."
"Can’t wait to have our own lewis hamilton or fernando alonso.speaking as an f1 fan, i wish my parents took me karting when i was younger because to be the best of the best you really gotta start at a young age."
Do your parents also happen to have atleast a million in disposable income for your hobby? Otherwise I doubt you would go very far despite starting young.
""
""
""
""
"Yup, another article shared in one of the comments of another kid is that the father is a shipping company director and training costs is in the 6 figures.So it's no issues for him. They even moved to Milan to pursue his training."
"Who's your favourite team/driver this year? I've always been a Ferrari fan, but since Massa and Alonso retired, I have no idea which driver I should support."
"Red Bull/Daniel Ricciardo, but since danny left I’ve taken a liking to renault"
"Renault have one of the best liveries, I'll give them that"
"Leclerc has potential for WDC, think this season is gonna be an exciting one."
"Can’t wait to have our own lewis hamilton or fernando alonso.Wow, already trying to claim, and bask, in his presumed glory. What did we ever do to help him get to where he is? Let's just spare him the undue baggage."
Thats a lot of Mario Kart Wii
Not easy especially since pole and 2nd were from the same team - usually the team mate in 2nd place 'protects' the leader.
He looks smaller compared to the rest? Same age?
What's that sound?? OMG IT'S MINDEF WITH YOUR ENLISTMENT FORM
"Bwahaha. Singapore will claim anything, even a boy called Tiziano Monza. If you bothered to look at the actual results here, he is Italian. The ""equipment"" is from Singapore. Not only is the Mothership article factually incorrect, it is very badly written and uses poor English. Low-effort post OP"
"If you bothered to look at the actual results clearly, it’s the TEAM that is from Italy, not the kid. He IS Singaporean. Low-effort comment, dude."
Not it doesn't. Have another look.
"OP, I think the picture will look a lot better if you can crop out the bottom part of it. Basically the railing(especially the light)."
Superb
pretty lights
Nice angle
"I uh, read it as “Gardens, by the way”."
My Korean friend says this place reminds her of Avatar hahaha
"In the past months, I'm seeing more and more of those ""Get Rich Quick"" schemes videos as ads on YouTube. First there's a guy promoting how to do marketing with his 1h free seminar, then this guy teaching you how to start your own business on Qoo10, then now a new video popping up of some 28 year old guy.Humour me this. Is it just me who's seeing this (I own a small business) or is it more widespread? If you remember there was a video saying ""Poor people make poor choices"". I think nobody is talking enough about these underhand sales tactics making people part with their money too. Yes we can be a nanny state but these things could be weeded out too.Do you encounter such videos? and I wonder how the community thinks about the prevalence of this."
"this kind of advertisement already in the internet more than 10~20 years, every kind of how to make you rich.Just think of this, no one will share how they actually make money to everyone, because it means that they are sharing their money to you, do you think a stranger will do this to another stranger?"
Of course I will! You send me $4000 and I will tell you how to make money fly
Hello Nigerian Prince
Unfortunately he died an hour ago. The highness Walachibaka has appointed you his rightful heir. PM me to inherit his fortune.
Can I claim the money? Lately my job not that great.
"Ok, just give credit card number, name, expiry date and the 3 whacky numbers on the back"
I can deposit the money directly to your account instead of you having to take it out yourself if you would so kindly give me your credit card details and the 3 numbers on the back
"Dang, I've $638,236 in an overseas account but I need $5000 in processing fees to access it. Can you lend that $5k?"

It's actually better with the grammatical error.

"""Nobody will share their secret to get rich unless you are their way of getting rich""Just thought I'd share this quote I saw some guy say on the internet once which made a lot of sense"
same applies for ''financial agents'' and ''wealth managers''
This is definitely true lol
That is so well said. But way too many people believe in short-cuts and lobangs.
That's one possible reason.The other is people aren't motivated to work. Eg you can earn extra money by driving Grab. It's a fact. But not everyone will go drive Grab for that extra money.
I keep seeing this kind of ad for some reasons .my YouTube is use mainly for esports and gaming.
It means they're targeting by location or age rather than interest.
Actually I'm 14 and I've been getting these on yt
Same same
"Not just youtube, it most probably showed you ads based on what you search in google, or maybe even as far as what sites you visit that has google tracking it"
"I'll share something I read previously on some of these get rick quick scams. Just generally letting you know the gist of it. True or not, here goes:A guy will post a link e.g. ""VISIT MY WEBSITE FOR SECRET ON HOW YOU CAN MAKE $1653 A WEEK"".Then, they will request a fee to be paid to them to release their secrets.After the victim has paid, they will receive a pdf file containing the instructions:How to get richCreate a link to your site which says "" LEARN MY SECRET OF MAKING $867 IN 2 DAYS""Ask the interested party to pay a small fee to release the secret.Send the interested party a PDF file with instructions step 1 - 3."
They even bothered to return a pdf file. How nice of them
"Then technically, it isn't a scam anymore. They fulfilled what they promised."
True enough
Smells like online MLM
Plus it gives you motivation to learn how to become a webmaster.
"During web 1.0, that was everywhere. Then web2.0 came along and the interwebz became cleaner, but the same snake oil started creeping back. I can't wait for web2 to die."
then this guy teaching you how to start your own business on Qoo10Is it the one with the aesthetically unpleasing man taking a selfie of his seminar attendees? I'm so sick of seeing his ugly mug on banners.
"Can we file a class action suit against him for causing mental distress of him haunting me on multiple web pages, concurrently. Ugh.."
I join on the class action against him. Haha
Think he had a stroke or smth. Went to his seminar once with my mother. Went along those lines of buy stuff from China and sell on qoo10 for profits.
"A friend who was retrenched got desperate and fork out $2k plus to attend the Qoo class ...Then now he driving Grab. Poor guy just wasted his precious money.I looked at the material given ... If you know how to use the internet, most of the information is available for free.All can be found on Youtube and Google"
"The ad is damn annoying sia, face also not nice, english also not good, video also maciam film on iPhone 5; seriously anyone who looks at this shitty ad and thinks ""hmm this seems like a legit thing to sign up for"" is just asking to be scammed."
Ikr. I think I've been seeing this since 2015
He literally looks like one of those sleezy looking molester you see on the bus/train
"I don't really see those nowadays and ever since I did a google after one of these ads piqued my interests (u gotta admit some are done quite well - private jets, eloquent man in suit blabbla), I immediately tuned out and X those pop ups.But I'm getting tons of those Korean ads selling perfumes that can effectively eliminate cigarettes smoke, pillows used by Korean celebs and even washing machines cleaners nowadays?? and I'm not even into the K culture.Weird."
Thy onli K kulture I get into is Cheesy Army Stew
"Usually you have to be at the tipping point of any culture that is about to break to be successful. Once something is trendy, it's a little too late to jump in."
"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is"

"`When the seagulls follow the trawler, it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea' - King Eric"
"That's not new really. Open the newspaper and check all the ads for get-rich-quick conference and classes where you supposedly learn the ""secret"" to make millions with property, stock market or crypto currencies. These ads have been there for as long as I can remember.Low financial education combined with kiasu is a potent and ruinous combo."
i gotta say i've been seeing one recent one that's at least semi-entertaining and i actually watched to the end - some qoo10 power seller guy plugging a course to get rich selling china products on qoo10.
"Is it the one, with a middle aged guy with glasses and grey shirt in a poorly lit office? Telling you to browse the topsellers and look for the “overseas sellers” one.That one was quite good leh hahaha. I got intrigued and really watched the full thing. Although what he said was really quite common sense la."
yah it's him. if i didn't have to pay i'd honestly watch more of his videos because he has that effortlessly engaging/entertaining kinda vibe lol. like some people are just funny.

THE PROVEN PROCESS OF HOW YOU CAN GO FROM WHATEVER YOU'RE MAKING NOW TO OVER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH

"No - I get the ""there's a MILF within 1km from your house!"" ads - I guess I'm surfing the wrong sites....."
"Use an AdBlock add-on.Also, one option on mobile is to use the AdBlock browser to watch YouTube."
I highly recommend Youtube Vanced for android. It has adblocking and background playback.https://www.xda-developers.com/youtube-vanced-apk/
"YouTube Vanced is great and works without root.If you're interested in blocking ads in browser/apps, check out Blokada. It blocks the hosts but it will function as a VPN(doesn't send stuff out so don't worry) so you are not able to use another VPN concurrently. Take note that Blokada does not work to block YouTube ads so use Vanced instead. Also take note that sometimes it might interfere with device updates and you may need to disable Blokada before the updates will start downloading.(happens for Xiaomi stuff on MIUI)"
LPT for Android: use YouTube Vanced
"You probably mean uBlock origin though when you say add-on, don't you?"
"It's not new. These silly things are usually linked to pyramids (that's the only way to get rich quick outside of a lucky investment). They've wormed their way into SMS, interstital ads and even whatsapp. And they do it more egregiously than the ones in the Straits Times Classified.Remember kids: work from home is best negotiated with your employer and is part of a culture package - NOT the be all end all. And, the legit businesses call it ""remoting"", not ""work from home"". :3"
"But here is the thing, why is pyramid/ mlm getting more and more popular even though its illegal in sg? Got in one of the mlm companies and leave after day 2 of their stupid training."
"The money is simply too good for the upstream. That's why they keep coming back and trying their best to evade. The good news is, because of their advertising tactics legit companies no longer use spam to put the word out."
Lol one of those guys featured was my NTU classmate.
"Report him to the police! Let's see how this goes :)If he's an innocent bystander, you get an ally to fight the ads.If he's an accomplice, at least someone will land in jail :)"
Yup I see those scammy ads almost all the time from YouTube.
"This Andrew guy has been talking about the same tactics he showed 4 yrs ago, so his video posted 4 yrs ago now becoming a quick-get-rich ads pushing against your eyeballs.Just pause and think: if his method works, why doesn't he continues using it to earn easy & good money instead of teaching you how to do it? This only tells you he can make more money by teaching you to be successful than selling online.Lastly, if everyone who learned from these gurus did the same trick to make money, aren't we creating competition which lead to corrosion of profit margin? As an old business saying: Competition is for losers, all successful businesses are monopoly."
Just use adblock 4Head
"If they aren't selling you a product, then you are the product."
"Those ads are sometimes not different from scams or from going to ""wealth"" seminars."
Maybe read r/antimlm
Rich people don't teach other people how to get rich.Unless you are the sheep that's gonna help them get rich.
"On whether these videos are a widespread thing. The ads shown on YouTube are likely tailored according to your search / surfing / viewing history on YouTube and on Google. So I doubt that it applies to everyone.Maybe you're coming across these ads because you own a small business, and you've been browsing on matters related to start ups and running your own business.I think the danger of ads like these is that they work best against people who are desperate to make quick and easy money. These are the people who would be blind or choose to ignore the warning signs.Unfortunately I don't think it's that easy to label and police these ads or schemes as a scam. It can very easily be presented as a legitimate business and investment opportunity, except with very high risks.Although it has its limitations, I think education of the public would be the most appropriate method to address these issues."
"I have some secrets too, get rich for as low as $1... Today draw okay ?"
LOL if people weren't so gullible like that guy here who gave the ang moh $ this wouldn't be an issue.
"reminds me of some time last year, when i joined some 'SG startup' whatsapp group chat and the people in it they do Hypnotism, loaning, 'overseas recruiting and outsourcing' and all sorts of weird shit. They're a bunch of middle age shaddy fellows"
Including Tai Lopez?
"If everyone in Sg gave me $1 each, I can teach you all how to become multi-millionaires. /s"
"I have attended a few of these FREE seminars. Usually they will introduce the course that suppose to help you make money. Then at the end, they will sell you the main course that is usually priced between $2000-$3000. And they will tell you the 'bonuses"" which will end up to $200000 is given free if you sign up there and then.There are courses on how they made millions Selling on Qoo, Amazon, Ebay and of course the usual stock and currency tradingActually most of them make more money selling the money making courses rather than the actual work they do. Otherwise why would they spend so much time and money advertising to get the trainees.There was this guy who sold umbrellas on Amazon and claimed to be the top few seller in Singapore. For the fees he charges one student, he has to sell 200 umbrellas. Which one do you think is better for him?But unfortunately a lot of retirees and jobless folks will fall for this kind of courses."
that is called anchoring in marketing. value it high and sell it relatively lower
These pyramid scheme are annoying asf lol
Ain’t the point of such videos on how to get rich is by giving seminar / making videos on how to get rich.You’ll get rich as people pay you to tell them how to get rich. Profit from cycle. Trump university.
Anyone with a brain would know it's a scam.
"it's easy for people like us to dismiss it's a scam however not all are so and could be hooked. i'm not sure how true this is but when i did listen to one of these guys give their ""free seminar"" before (used a fake account and all), 6 of his slots each going for $2888 were snapped up in less than 10 minutes. that way where the money goes is the real danger there."
"At some restaurant, did you never see tip jar filled with 10-50$?Do you think people drop 10-50$, i could understand maybe 2$ or some lose change but entire jar filled with big notes is BS.On your own system you can just fudge any number of seats taken and when people start throwing their money just release those fake taken seats."
6 of his slots each going for $2888 were snapped up in less than 10 minutes. that way where the money goes is the real danger there.May or may not be real people snapping it up. Most of the time is planted one.
This is one technique used in those free seminar ...They have audience to fake interest and sign up for the course.So those hesitating will be prompted and assured when they see others signing up.
"Its usually not a scam, which is how they are able to conduct this legally. Most of these sell “financial advice” on trading some sort of financial instruments - and although it is possible to make those kind of returns one has to be REALLY good to do it - something that requires years of practice and studying and not simply from watching or reading some video or pdf."
"Ads and shady businesses are a whole lot more predatory outside of Singapore, this isn't new nor all that serious if we're being objective."
Just keep clicking on those ads when you see them and then close the window after.
I get these all the time skip them all. I only hope those gullible won’t be fooled. Dude the quality for most of them just screams dubious!
Here in my garage....
"I see this but on Facebook. Anyone gets it too? It’s a man in late 20s, sharing the secrets to getting rich quick."
This is is alllll over my videos. Almost every as I watch is the get rich quick
"Hey man i have been cringing pretty hard over those ads and web banners wherever. But perhaps due to the John Oliver effect, i get a kick watching them these 1-2 months, even going to their websites to see how convincing they can be. So now it's just entertainment to me. :)"
hahahaha did u know john oliver's one on MLM was dubbed in spanish to tackle that vulnerable community?
Yes I've been encountering these ads on YouTube and it's starting to annoy me already. Hope they can take down these ads 🙄
"I remember once I saw Cayden Chang’s “how to make $1M with only $10K”. I watched. The secret is to top up lots of $ monthly and with some ridiculous investment interest, in 10 years.Yeah 1M from 10K my ass.The dude face is cancerous."
"Internet advertising pretty smart nowadays, it's all interlinked from what you google, what you watch on facebook, the instagram ads that you click etc, so perhaps you're an entrepreneur or you are easily interested in things relating to finance it'll be shown to you"
"When I was job hunting a few years back I responded to a job ad that said something like clerical work, flexible hours. Got a phone call asking me to come to a presentation about the job details.Turned out it was an hour long presentation by that ""get rich while working from home"" guy with the eyebags and thinning hair saying how great and risk free drop shipping services are and how if you pay him a fee he will give you the tools to start your own drop shipping business on qoo10 selling an eyebag tightening product.I was furious that some shady agent had used me to get some kind of commission for number of bodies in the room. Huge waste of my time. If they were willing to use such tactics to get me there what else were they willing to do to get rich."
"I have been encountering these ads regularly since a month ago. I watched them in full, cos it's refreshing to hear a Singaporean accent on YouTube and to support the channels I watch. But I'll never click on anything they tell me to click."
"Come to think of it, what if they actually found a way to make 5k/month, so that’s not much, but okay to many people. If they keep their secret to themselves, they won’t gain. They can share with others to get lesson fee. Provided that teaching others how to get $5k/month won’t harm them (eg their students became their competitors), yet bringing in lots of cash then why not? Every body win.That’s the theory, how about the real classes in Singapore? Has anyone attended can give review?"
Those ads? Oh I forgot they existed
I see it too!
Yes we can be a nanny stateAnyone with some common sense would have seen the bullshit in that. It's about as obvious as knowing not to walk into the path of a speeding car. It's unnecessary to do extra work to weed them out. The people who are dumb enough to fall for them will always find other dumb ways to mess themselves up.Shortcuts will always mess up dumb people. People who take slimming pills or buy into another overblown dumb fad that at best waste their money or at worst destroy their organs and kill them. People who jump into the stock market because some uncle told them they can make a ton of money very quickly. MLMs. Nigerian prince/long lost relative emails. Etc. You can't hold their hand throughout their lives.

Use adblock
Ah yes the get rich quick ads. Suddenly theres a shit ton of them and the one of the only things I watch are gaming videos
"Facebook have a lot of such ads last time. Now it’s full of shopping ads, of which my fren & hubby get scammed from purchasing through such ad. The mod of operation is cash on delivery and they engage ninja van to help with it."
"Most of these are e-commerce. It used to work a couple of years ago, that was when e-commerce blogging was still profitable. Then it got a bit out of hand because of blackhats and Google decided to launch yearly upgrades to their search engine. Over time bloggers found their earnings drop until it's no longer enough to sustain their expenses.As with most ""get rich quick"" schemes, the next step is to go into teaching/consulting. As they say, ""those who can, do, those who can't, teach"".To be clear, e-commerce is not dead. But you need an incredible dose of hardwork and luck to make it work."
"Haters be hattin, I have actually gotten really rich and own 21 Ferarri thanks to youtube ads and a Nigeria prince :)"
"Actually i want to make you even more richer, my grand father have oil reserves but we need a foreigner..... (you get where i am going).We need your help, if you are interested send me email at get_ready@to_be_scamed.com"
Wow sure seems legit! I'll hahaa
"if the dude in the video is from S'pore, report to police.report it on youtube, when enough viewers report it, it will be taken down."
I reported some of the scammy ads that teaches you trading and becoming millionaires overnight (ya right) to FB and YouTube. They won't ban unless I can prove that they are scams.
"Just do a google search on how to block Adds in Youtube App, put some money in a good add blocker and never see adds again ;)."

What's wrong with dropping some bucks to a developer doing the lord's work?
"I was reading this on My phone so my mind went to think Youtube app on phone (never thought OP could be watching at computer).In that case sure he can go ahead and get free plugin for Chrome/Firefox or whatever browser he is using.But for Youtube app, either he can get mod Youtube app around which can solve Adds issue. Or get paid adblock option (which is local VPN)."

How to fix the SAF?MORE SAF!
Making it easier for them to climb rank by having so many more job openings
"Safety is an issue because in the first place, no one on the ground gives a fuck because no one wants to be there!"
Ownself check ownselfGENIUS!
How to improve safety in the SAF?Appoint another general to be in charge of safety and reiterate the same things but harder!
Sure. Make it a whistleblower act. 1000sgd per safety lapse reported. Put the money where the mouth is
1000sgd?Make it 1 year off your 2 year ns sentence for nsfs. Commander won't get a chance to tekan whistle blowers if you ord.
If safety is 2nd nature I won’t even book into camp. Too much arrows and land mines.

HMMM is SAF trying to hold SAF accountable for safety?
"Hey if most people think the PAP can keep themselves accountable, why not the SAF?"
Lol nothing is going to change..
"Instead of nerfing/buffing minor changes, why not look at if from scratch? nvm"
Yes. Add a few more steps to the process and procedures and make the lowly grunt bear the weight of the responsibility.

Yup. When cows fly.
This is so dumb lmao
"SINGAPORE - Brigadier-General Tan Chee Wee has been appointed the first Inspector-General in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) to oversee training safety, as part of several measures undertaken after a recent spate of military fatalities.BG Tan, who is now Director Joint Operations and takes on the role of Chief of Staff-Joint Staff next Wednesday (Feb 27), said one of his first priorities is to make it second nature for soldiers to flag unsafe practices.In an interview transcript sent to the media by the Defence Ministry (Mindef) on Friday (Feb 22), BG Tan said his ""immediate priority"" was to visit ground units across the SAF to assess the health of the open reporting and safety culture and evaluate the services' safety inspection systems.He said: ""With these findings, I will then recommend to the Chief of Defence Force proposals that will further enhance the SAF's safety management as well as strengthen its safety culture.""Open reporting must be a safety norm so that our soldiers and commanders can feel empowered and committed to do open reporting without fear of reprisal.""He added that he also plans to introduce ""concrete action"" in promoting open reporting, ensuring the quality of safety inspections, and strengthening the safety culture across the SAF. He reiterated that the aim is  ""zero training fatalities"".BG Tan said while the SAF's fighting units are charged with maintaining operational effectiveness in defending Singapore, they must also uphold high safety standards.He said: ""My office will make independent assessments on the services' safety inspection system. This will ensure that they adopt stringent benchmarks for safety performance and culture of their units.""BG Tan accompanied Chief of Defence Force Melvyn Ong to visit the 295th Battalion, Singapore Artillery on Wednesday (Feb 20), where they were briefed on the safety training for soldiers during their in-camp training.BG Tan has held a range of senior appointments in Mindef and the SAF, such as Commander Air Defence and Operations Command, director of policy office, and head of air plans.Mindef, in a statement earlier on Friday, said Brigadier-General Kelvin Khong, who is now  Chief of Staff-Joint Staff, will take over from Major-General Mervyn Tan as Chief of Air Force on March 22.The Inspector-General's Office (IGO) was announced on Jan 31, after the death of operationally ready national serviceman and Singapore actor Aloysius Pang on Jan 23, four days after he was seriously injured in an overseas military exercise.Mindef said previously that the Inspector-General will have powers to conduct independent audits and promote safety culture across the service and formation headquarters.He will report jointly to the Permanent Secretary (Defence) and the Chief of Defence Force, and the IGO will submit regular safety performance reports to the Defence Minister.Training safety in the SAF had attracted increased attention in recent weeks, with Corporal First Class (NS) Pang the fourth training-related death since September 2017."
HAHAHAHAHAHAS
"Residents of Northern, North Eastern parts of Singapore, has this foul air situation been a persistent issue or is it only a recent occurrence? I only just moved here and I find the frequency of this happening unacceptable. If it has been going on for some time, has the residents here accepted this as part of life? If it happened only recently are we not going to do anything about it?"
Tonight I can smell smoke in the West on the way home from Holland Village 😱😱😱Wondering if you are referring to the burning smell
There was an issue with air quality past 2 weeks NE part of SG. If West side has it too then it might be worse than what previous cases.
"According to haze.gov.sg, east of Singapore in malaysia there's a hot spot. Maybe is some accidental burning of the forest.That + winds = current smellEdit:typo"
"Thanks, good to know"
"here are the sg reddit posts that talks about it :) hope it gives you a clearer idea of what ppl think it isPost explaining whats happening, very informativehttps://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ar2yhn/clarifying_the_doubts_of_those_who_see_a_bright/?utm_source=reddit-androidpost about people discussing about the effects/what they smellhttps://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aoh9wr/haze_in_the_east_now_no_joke/?utm_source=reddit-androidPost about how the ignition looks likehttps://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aroa2u/a_creeping_sight_to_be_common/?utm_source=reddit-android"
My two cents. If it is haze caused by natural occurrences such as bush fires I don't think anybody can do anything about it. What I feel is worthy of a debate is whether we should be exposed to such pollution ever so frequently if it is caused by industrial activities such as the one at pasir gudang. Call me paranoid but has it occurred to anyone that this burning activity is increased because of the current relations between the two?
ye ikr! its sad that the threads didnt get more attention
"Staying in Hougang.Smell some burning smell too around midnight.However, months ago and last week it came back. Always after evening around 8pm onwards, sometime 10pm, always have a weird chemical or plastic smell, slightly towards those flowers smell. (Those who don't like certain flower smell you get what I mean)...I don't know if it's my nose more sensitive than others, I asked my family members, they don't smell it or don't find it weird. Sometime i feel like vomiting when I come across that smell."
chemical? does it remind you more of haze or more of chemical plastic smell?
Not really Haze. I don't know how to describe.
Someone at Mothership was literally paid to repost the image and write a few sentences underneath it.
sgagsg gets paid for making memes with ad content :D
"Dude that’s high standards for mothership, they had to do more than copy and paste from reddit."
"I meant that Mothership paid for a guy to write this ""article""."
It got people interested and click so it's a win for mothership and a win for the writer.
I guess we should also blame the people who read shit like this
Nothing's really wrong here. People read because they found it intriguing.
Ouch 2.6k for a phone.That’s a no from me.

"The Independent Singapore posted an article which is based on a Redditor’s post here regarding TCJ allegedly shutting down a student who asked him a question.Many Redditors’ responses were also copied wholesale, and with all your handles. I assume everyone’s permissions were not sought for reproduction, nor did the “journalist” make any checks for facts and errors on their end as a media publication.Have a look at how the Reddit post was reproduced:http://theindependent.sg/tan-chuan-jin-allegedly-shut-down-student-who-asked-why-the-govt-does-not-do-more-to-help-certain-races/What do you all think about other media publications reproducing a post from here, copying all your responses, with no checks nor permissions sought?"
"From the Reddit User Agreement to which you clicked ""Agree"" without reading:your contentYou retain the rights to your copyrighted content or information that you submit to reddit (""user content"") except as described below.By submitting user content to reddit, you grant us a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform, or publicly display your user content in any medium and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, and to authorize others to do so.You agree that you have the right to submit anything you post, and that your user content does not violate the copyright, trademark, trade secret or any other personal or proprietary right of any other party.So, ""The Independent"" might have gotten permission from Reddit to reproduce your content (but probably didn't)."
"They didn’t get Reddit’s permission.To all the future plagiarists, please remember your Ethics in Journalism 101. If you are reproducing with permission, please state so. Also, whatever happened to interviewing your subjects to get the story?I just don’t want to adopt the “lan lan suck thumb” stance, but make it known that I’m speaking up against such practices."
and to authorize others to do so.Too bad it's stated fairly clearly that you authorize more than just Reddit to reuse what you post here.
You allow reddit to authorize others. Not the same thing
"Doesn't matter, Singapore's own copyright law already covers the act of quoting when it comes to reporting the news."
Lol do you even English.
Lol do you even Copyright Law.
"The authority is granted to Reddit, and Reddit has the authority to grant these permissions."
"And? I went to lookup Singapore's fair deal laws:There are also specific fair dealing scenarios where use of a work would not constitute infringement:Fair dealing for purpose of reporting current eventsWhere the work is used for the purpose of reporting current events in newspapers, magazines or periodicals and is accompanied by sufficient acknowledgement of the work.Turns out there wasn't any need for them to even seek permission from Reddit, because it's already covered under Singapore's fair deal laws. By your own admission, they ""copied the handles wholesale"" so that meant there were plenty of acknowledgement given to the original sources."
Is this kind of journalism okay for you? Can you read the points I have made in the thread above?
"I dont think you can call sites like The Independent ""journalism"" - they're literally just trawling for clicks with whatever material they can findFuckers like these giving Shanmugam all the reasons he needs to push through new laws curtailing press freedoms lmao"
"Pfft, as if historically the PAP needed reasons of all things outside of whether it's convenient for them."
"Ayiah you take your pick - reasons, excuses, states of emergency, Marxist conspiracies..."
"Yes, I suddenly realise I should not apply the same ethics in journalism on them. I actually don’t read The Independent and just happened to come across this today."
"Our state media also has ""Ashley Wu""..."
"What points? Singapore's Copyright Law already allows this as an exception.They don't need to ask your precious permission to report what you say as news, so stop acting like an entitled snowflake."
"nahhhhyou authorise reddit and others to do so is not the same asThe authority is granted to Reddit, and Reddit has the authority to grant these permissions."
"But the statement says ""you grant us a [blah blah blah] license to [do this and that] and to authorize others to do so.""It looks like OP is right and you're wrong."
"BruhBy submitting user content to reddit, you grant us a ... license to ... publicly display your user content in any medium and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, and to authorize others to do so.Yeah the license is given to reddit, not others. Reddit can use this license to give it to others. So you have to go through reddit."
"The authority is granted to Reddit, and Reddit has the authority to grant these permissions.This is exactly what it is on the T&C. Seems like the horde downvoting OP don't read"
r/Singapore in a nutshell.
please remember your Ethics in Journalism 101.Implying
"i have a feeling that OP will burst into flames if (s)he meet mothership or subreddits that is focused on reposting comments eg r/punpatrol xdeither way, according to t&c, they are allowed to do so. i dont seem to get why is it considered plagiarism if they credited the things they said to their usernames/handles.even if it is plagiarism, i would like to believe the reason for this t&c is for easy sharing of content to create a more engaging community. imagine getting sued or banned from reddit just for reposting someone's comment.oddly enough, imo, this reminds of article 13 of EU, a law that practically no one wanted even though plagiarism was an issue. why? i would like to believe that it is cause the internet including reddit is based around sharing content to some extent. r/singapore shares news and photos from everywhere (eg. facebook comments that are not theirs), r/pics shares/reposts photos or r/dankmemes where reposts are everywhere. the internet is based around sharing content made by other users and it is what keeps it alive, the t&c was made for the good of the reddit users."
"either way, according to t&c, they are allowed to do so.Let me help you with this:By submitting user content to reddit, you grant us a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform, or publicly display your user content in any medium and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, and to authorize others to do so.This is how that particular clause should be read:By submitting user content to reddit, you grant us a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license … to authorize others to do so."
"We are not talking about memes or puns here, we are discussing ethics in journalism. Furthermore, the topic of the article in question is about an important discussion of politics and race. Surely, the journalist can do more than copying wholesale?"
"We are not talking about memes or puns here,edit: i thought you were discussing about the ethics of the t&c that allowed the journalists to do whatever they wantSurely, the journalist can do more than copying wholesale?it ensures that the og meaning of the comment comes across well. people have been taking out of context and it really twists the meaning that they were saying. you can comment on their comment if thats what you're talking about"
"Have you seen the article “written” by the journalist vis a vis the original post? If that is okay for you, by all means, carry on."
"no, did they handpick comments?typical of them tsktsktskso what you were trying to say the whole time is that they shouldn't be allowed to handpick comments that support their points?orm"
"It's legal anyway, and literally every news outlet does this.This whole post is an exercise of manufactured outrage with the OP doubling down on his bullshit after being pointed out it's legal by Singapore Law multiple times."
legal doesn't mean it is ethicalits still not okay to be a bias news outlet as its spreads wrong information. law and the govt shld not be given the power to determine fully what is bias or not (or they'll be given the full control of the media) and so its legal. doesnt mean its ethical tho
"I didn't say legal means ethical. It's ethical because it's the standard accepted protocol to quote without permission when reporting the news.No news outlet in the developed world, not just Singapore, have to seek permission from the original source to quote what they say, because they are all covered by different variants of fair use/fair deal laws."
"TISG/Mamaship are not journalists. Even ST/CNA/Today is snooping to their level because it's cheaper, better(more hits) and faster"
can you share examples of how ST/CNA/TODAY stoop to the same level? not a big fan but i believe they at least try to contact the people they quote online... except for train breakdowns...at least as far as i remember
Ehh go find articles that just cut and copy from someone's FB note/post there have been quite a few.
Hmm.. guess I never really took notice. Will keep an eye out
I understand now. Thanks. I’m saddened by the state of “journalism” here. No wonder many who trained in journalism do not practise their trade here.
"So, ""The Independent"" might have gotten permission from Reddit to reproduce your content (but probably didn't).They are too cheap to do so"
"I think it's okay to reproduce reddit posts if the main incident at hand is about a reddit post.However, as the person who asked the question, I think it's really misleading to not include my comment. Most of what was discussed was speculation before I gave my side of the story. (I posted like 2 hours after thread was made)Since this whole issue is about more transparent communication (be it between the government and students/news sources and reddit), I just hope they'll update the news article."
"The journalist should have contacted you (the student) instead and actually write her article with information of the subject and actual event. From there, many more pertinent questions can be asked for a second article. I suddenly realise we have journalists who might not have been trained in actual journalism."
"I agree. But the fact of the matter is we have no intellectual right on our comments here, as weird as it sounds."
"Just like we have many armchair critics like you who don't know that it's perfectly ethical, and most importantly, legal, to quote others directly when reporting the news as long as adequate attribution is given."
Get used to it
At least they credit.What about reddiporeans who went above and beyond to remove a credit?
"How should we feel about Mothership.sg reposting from reddit with their mildly toned commentaries? Should we feel the same?Or the way how Mothership repost is more ethical (waiting for the other viewpoint, attempt to justify so as to pacify outrage)?"
Hope to see other Redditors’ replies to you because I’m not sure which articles are these. I’m not a regular reader of such sites. Do they rewrite their own articles on topics seen here or basically a copy? My previously-expressed sentiments remain the same regardless of where the journalists come from.
You can refer to their history on reposting reddit: https://mothership.sg/?s=reddit
"That’s a long list just on the first page alone! Thanks but I’m not going to click on individual articles, read them and then dig out the respective Reddit posts and compare if the journalists copied them too. I am happy to hear other Redditors’ opinions though (minus the people who actually plagiarise and earn money that way because it is obvious)."
"Nothing can stop posts and comments from being reproduced. It’s a common practice for news sites to generate content that people will click on.But when such sites keep doing this lazy, unoriginal reporting, my opinion of whether they’re a reliable press or not goes down. All that shit re-gurgitating does these sites no good in the long-term."
"The reality is, some of them are doing very well. Case in point: BuzzFeed."
"So they took a run with news that cannot be verified ah. End of day, can be one guy with multiple account trying to debate against himself. Maybe that's how theindependent coin its name."
Why do they disguise it as a repost if they are hardworking enough to come up with their own points?
"see guys, that's what I mean in dual accounts to support an argument."
Your accusation is unfounded and you have yet to answer my question.
i would hardly call the independent singapore's writers journalist..same with TOC. their sole purpose seems to take things out of context and put a massive negative spin on it.
The mods here should implement a rule?
"r/sg mods have no control over what news sites post, nor do they have rights to the content here."
"The article names Reddit as the source, even cites the nick of the redditor and clearly quotes correctly the extract of each and every post. All required credits and acknowledgements have been made. That’s how all media operates.You only need permission if you want to reproduce the whole article intact.They have helped the cause of the redditor by amplifying to a wider audience.It’s a like a someone asking you what’s your opinion of addressing flooding. You can say that you agree with the Ministry’s innovative solution. Looks odd if you say that I cannot say because I have not got their permission to discuss their Method."
"Thank you to the other posters for information on the user agreement made with Reddit. In the cases of parties quickly reproducing content and not seeking permission from Reddit who holds the rights, what then?So anyone can lurk around and copy and repost content to generate revenue for their own sites?"
"what then?One way you can help is by not wasting a single second of your time on sites like Mothershi* and ""The Independent"", which are crap anyway."
"I get the essence of what you are saying, but this topic is about the ethics of journalism, plagiarism and how people feel about being plagiarised for another’s profit."
The assumption here is that they are ethical.
Why don’t we call them out instead of accepting the status quo?
And one way you can do that is not to click on their articles and let them earn ad money.
"Do Mothershi* and ""The Independent"" strike you as being remotely professional enough to even consider ethics?"
"Today, I learned what The Independent is about based on this move, so I am calling them out. Based on this, I am not going to go reading the rest of it. I assume they are a re-poster? Regarding Mothership, I think they are an advertising medium posting about various brands and businesses for money?"
How do you feel about those who post articles that are behind a paywall?
I know you are probably trying to corner me and drag this out of topic... but do you mean Redditors who post “premium” articles from ST?
"No, I'm not. This is something that's been troubling me too. I'm irritated when I see other sites rip off stuff from reddit but on the other hand also stand to benefit from people 'pirating' premium content. Just wanted to hear someone else's thoughts on it."
"Sorry for making the assumption. I saw the aggression earlier from someone for asking a valid question. Good question. Most of the “premium” articles reposted here by people are from ST. I don’t subscribe to ST as a matter of principle but get my news from other sites, foreign and local. Similar articles are mostly found in various news sources and I get them via email. I do read discussions on Reddit on these news to get a feel of our collective views. We used to get more decent discussions and sometimes you get gold comments. Now I realise you get a lot of Mothershippers and The Indecopiers here. I probably brought a few out of the woodwork. Lol.It is okay to get inspired by topics here, just write and do the actual work like a journalist if you call yourself one. Singapore and the state of our media deserve better."
"No worries. Most probably I'm overthinking it.From my perspective, both are wrong, but why do we tend to justify one and put down the other. Oh well. Have a good weekend, don't let this bother you too much."
"Thanks! Have a good weekend too! Nah, not bothered, just surprised it has devolved into personal name-calling. I think the discussion has gone into different tangents anyway - Singapore Law and Journalism (or lack thereof)."

"Quite cliche but I was with my first bf for 4 years - through NS and everything - before he went overseas to study. Within 6 months I found out he was cheating on me with some girl over there.

ok relevant username but i'm now impossibly angry for you. what kind of betrayal?! i am so glad that you're in a better spot in life now and you deserve all the happiness! <3
what kind of betrayal?!Ikr! But it all worked out in the end so hey. Thanks for the well wishes :)
"Probably being told that I have leukemia. Good news is that its a chronic form (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia to be specific). Bad news is that I have to live with it for the rest of my life.Bone marrow is a cure, even today but specifically for my condition, taking oral medication to prevent it from progressing is the better option and it had a higher survical rate (On paper at least)But to know that you can such condition at a young age (I was then 23) is quite depressing and you wouldnt know when it will mutate into an acute version of it (I'm going to be 26 this year) and knowing that I may pass away very young - and its something I didn't want my parents to go through that pain of sending their child off.But what brought me out was the people around me that was very understanding and taught me to look at life more positively. It has been three years then and I'm pretty much still fit and alive so I'm quite great. But still there are times i still have those old thoughts of the scenario that I may leave early.Though, it was fun going to the cancer centre for my check up and have older folks come up to me and praise me for accompaning my parents, based on their assumption. It was quite funny to see their stunned faces when I told them it was them accompaning me instead 😂."

"I feel you. I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma when I was 22, just mere 2 years ago, right in the middle of university just before the finals. Went through tons of shit but managed to live through it. Really changes your life perspective after that man. You get to see who really stood by your side and who are your so-called friends. I am kinda glad, in a weird way, that I went through it all to be honest."
People left you because you got cancer?
"Yeah, kinda. In those times, you could tell who are the ones who are really sticking by your side and not cast you aside because they deemed you to be no longer of ""value"". These are the people who would find faults with you by pinning the cancer on poor personal lifestyle choices when in fact Hodgkin's Lymphoma has no exact causes for it. It's kind of hard to put into words what I mean though. But I would have to say battling the cancer is more of a mental fight."
That's so sad. Can't imagine how it would be like for less understood medical problems.
"Did pretty badly for year 1 in Poly and was feeling pretty disheartened. Managed to turn things around in year 2 and 3 by having more self discipline, drive and focus. Also helped that my lecturers and parents were very supportive.Scored A/Distinction for almost every module in Y2 and Y3 including FYP. Even got PwC as my internship company. The hunger and mindset to be the top scorer for any test/project really helped me to accomplish this.Interviewed for local unis but unfortunately didn't get in. Currently studying overseas in one of UKs top 10 unis."
It's saddening to read you can't get into local uni even with results. .
In singapore poly students have hard time getting in. Only 20% of poly students will get into uni. But this percentage is higher than a decade ago.
I see. Didn't know the rate is that low tbh. I didn't pursue a degree after not being able to get into what I wanted as well. But I'm self aware of my crappy gpa though lol
"Just for some context, https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/1-in-3-local-university-students-admitted-last-year-is-a-polytechnic-student""20% Approximate percentage of poly diploma holders going to university this year"""
Gaining some working experience may help. My poly result was average B and i was offered a place in NTU after working for 2 years. Din take it up though and decided to go oversea with my savings during the 2 years.
True. But I didn't want to waste any more time after NS haha
do they take into consideration your working experience or a\o level results?
Probably working experience as my O level result not even qualify for JC.
there's hope for me then. how is the transition? i tried 1 sem in uni... only got Bs.. very average for me...
"I feel I can cope better with my working experience. I can understand lecture well and relate what is taught in practice. Compare to my peer who continue their study to U, i can get better result than them."
I don't suppose the 'local unis' include SIT and its affiliates? Those do take in poly students by the truckloads
They didn't offer the course I wanted to pursue unfortunately
"In Sec 2 I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease, which is quite a rare autoimmune disorder and it made me quite miserable because:It was so damn rare in SG and of course with my shit luck I got it(IIRC there was only 1k patients when I was diagnosed)When I went back to school my classmates made fun of me about it (I had to be put on a special milk formula diet, and immature teenagers just couldn't resist spouting crap)I ended up falling behind on my CCA stuff, which affected my confidence and my ability to build camaraderie amongst my CCA matesBut I was lucky to have a supportive family and some understanding friends and with time I got better both physically and emotionally. Sometimes time is really the best way to make pain go away."
"I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. 1 level lower than yours 11 years ago. Depressed but luckily family n friends stood by. Noone understood our needs to go to the toilet.. or sometimes our bowels are uncontrolled in the beginning of that part of life. At that time only my then gf now wife supported me througout, she slowly made other classmates understand what I've been through. Bloody stools, shitty pants and overpowering gas build up in your tummy... fever... SULFASALAZINE AND AZATHIOPRINE ALL THE TIME. Im lucky its dormant now..."
You got a keeper.
"Seems like you had it worse than me, let's hope it stays dormant for as long as possible. Also congrats on having such a great SO!"
Were you featured in the news recently? I remember reading a similar article.
Nope though I think it might have been someone in the same patient support group as me
"Passed the pilot selection interviews and tests at the rsaf then one week before enlistment I was diagnosed with stage 1 lymphoma. Straight pes A to F. Went through chemo and radiotherapy for about 1.5 years then recovered. Was low-key depressed throughout. Weight gain, mood swings and generally feeling like shit.Dreams dashed but am now studying in a private uni and trying to get my fitness back I guess. Still trying to get over the fact that I'll never live the pilot dream."
Dam. Remember you in the dailies. I thought at least you got to skip NS. Turned out to be a double whammy sia.Cannot join airline pilot programs?
I'm not too sure about that. Will look at options!
"Was going to use a throwaway but fuck it.Was in a toxic, longterm long distance relationship. Least to say that he was not a supportive partner at all, mentally and emotionally abusive, displayed lots of Stockholm's symptoms.Got into poly, 1.5 GPA in 1.1 and failed a module, was treated as a problematic kid by lecturers cause I'm from a single parent family. Turned my GPA to a 3.5 in 1.2, still treated like shit cause I had a super drama queen classmate with health issues who accused that I was 'bullying them' (they had been bullied severely back in sec sch and had to have an MOE superintendent address the issue). Developed anxiety soon after, was on meds for a few months. Maintained 3.5 GPA until year 3, was forced into doing an industrial internship/FYP under a batshit insane supervisor who didn't acknowledge my anxiety. I was a 'good' student and was forced into projects that I was reluctant to take on. Poly FYP was a continuation of my internship, did R&D for a health product for a subsidiary company whose parent company is well known for their sugar rolls. Throughout my poly education my mental health was completely disregarded for until they found out I was suicidal.Graduated with a GPA of 2.8, my CGPA got fucked over by my year 3 grades. Ended up going to SIMGE like many other students in my course (my course is relatively niche and a dead end unless you're able to study overseas).Took a gap year before uni, finally decided to end things with my ex. Met my current bf online who's helped me out immensely with the healing process. I almost never get anxiety attacks now and weaned off using ativan. Got to see him irl and brought him around SG, seeing him again in a few months.My poly story isn't exactly rare, I've had a few friends who have been fucked over by the system (corrupt FYP supervisor failed their FYP on purpose), one of them is now studying at DigiPen. I'm glad the nightmare is over now."
the one studying at digipen is the student or supervisor?
"Student. The poly I studied at has a lot of crappy teaching staff, lots of internal issues and a general feeling of discontent among the staff."
"Cliché but during NS. Setting up our basha 1st night during outfield. Ground is muddy (fucking quicksand level) as it was raining heavily, tent poles won't stick and tent kept collapsing.Knee deep in mud I felt so fucking helpless and my buddy went to sleep in the mud, giving up on everything. Not sure what struck me exactly but at that point I've never felt so alone and helpless, I don't blame my buddy at all though. 100% understand just rolling in the mud due to fatigue.So I took a deep breath and told myself to do it slowly and know that I have the whole night to do it. Shits ain't bad, I got 2 arms 2 legs (immobile due to mud and marching). Finally managed to prop it up at about 4am after struggling since 7pm last light.Best 1 hour of sleep ever. And then a few months later went to dB cause apparently you can't leave your weapon with your buddy when u go to the toilet during guard duty."
That last paragraph....

apparently you can't leave your weapon with your buddy when u go to the toilet during guard duty.DB for that? damn
"I’d come out of my first year in uni with a very decent gpa, attached for the first time in my life and won a medal (also for the first time) for my uni’s track team for IVP and was finally on the list for selection for the asean uni team and it would’ve been my first Singapore jersey id have earned.In a month I’d contracted an autoimmune disease that fucks up my skin that also gave me arthritis so bad I couldn’t even limp around on some days and was in constant pain. Needless to say I went into depression and my grades went off a cliff and the sport I spent my entire life on became an impossibility.I will never be cured, though I am thankfully better now.

"Glad to know you're in a better place now! I wanted to post but realised I posted in the original thread, so I'm not gonna rehash the whole story.But honestly looking back, I'm actually kind of thankful it happened because it landed me in a different department where I actually like the work much better, and I'm kind of carving out my own niche here now.So again, for anyone who's down or not in a good place - don't give up! Get some help, talk to friends or family, anything. Just keep going."
"Awhile back, an ex committed suicide. Always blamed myself for it. Became depressed and toxic.I'm got my life back by keeping myself busy with work and other ventures.

"For me it was primary school, I had come to sg from India when I was in p3 and was in an international school for a while then transferred to a local school in bedok for p4 . After the first week of joining the school I hated going there as I was being bullied by almost everyone in my class from p4-p6 cos of my weight . It all came to a head in p6 after Ers to prepare for PSLE, 5 of the bullys ,let's call them B1-5, ganged up on me and that day my stupid ass brought my phone (my most prized possession at that time , it didn't have a screen protector) and was texting my parents that I'd be home in half an hour and got kicked in the ass by B1 and as an instant reaction I turned around and punched him in the gut Then I got kicked in the hand which had my phone and it flew , lacking a screen protector it's screen cracked , then I lost it and kicked bully 1 in the nuts and punched B2 and the rest started backing up and I ended up breaking B1's glasses. To top it off no action was taken by the principal. To date this was the lowest point in my life. A few people from my school came to my secondary school and I am currently in Sec 3 and my life is much better now. I have got to reconnect with a former classmate who is now in my history class and funnily enough was asked out by my close friend on valentine's Day and they couldn't go for a date cos my former classmate fell sick"

I would love to try this but i wouldn't have the strength to cycle my rental back.
Did y'all do a return leg?
"Me and my mate were thinking of heading up to Labrador Park, but we chilled at Raffles Place instead."
Jesus you're giving me BMT flashbacks with most parts of that route...
"I did my long jog here almost every weekend during my NS times.Starting point was near Bedok Jetty and we jog all the way till satay by the bay, and take a bus home.A very scenic jog route.Though it's been 5 years since i ORDed, I now feel too old to even go for a 2.4km jog."
Great shot!
Night cycling...

Hmm. Nice spot for a strolling date.

"IIRC, Gurkhas are not allowed to get citizenship even after decades of loyal service, even after having lived the bulk of their adult life and starting families here.Once their contract is done, they're shipped back home, family and all."
"Yup it's actually very sad - their kids basically grew up here and are for all intents and purposes as 'authentic singaporean' as you and me, and many end up having to go back to Nepal in their teens."
I hope they are well compensated for their service here. Hopefully they're given enough pay to live nicely back in their homeland.
Should be? They are elites in their country.
Think I heard people say the basic pay is 3k+ with food and lodging for the family all paid. Maybe higher rank more pay?
"Think I heard people say the basic pay is 3k+ with food and lodging for the family all paid. Maybe higher rank more pay?2nd EDIT: In addition to Matserkant reddit saying these rates are what a private organization is paying to MHA for the gurkhas, whkoh redditor has also shared that the below rates are what MAS pays for the usage of the Gurkhas.https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/PFA2004-RG1?DocDate=20140328&ViewType=Pdf&_=20171007040150Scroll down to Page 21 and 221st EDIT: Masterkant redditor shared with me that the rates stated in the document are what payable to MHA if a private organisation wants to hire Gurkhas, not what MHA pays the Gurkhas. Hence, the rates stated in the document are NOT the pay of Gurkhas. In which case, I still don't have a clue as to how much are Gurkhas are paid."
Tldr;6k minimum. Way above our already distorted median salary.
"TldrI perhaps seem to remember, quite some time ago, that there was some kind of strike and unrest inside the Gurkha camp and the pay was raised due to this.https://sbr.com.sg/transport-logistics/exclusive/smrt-drivers%E2%80%99-strike-over-what%E2%80%99s-been-learnedUnder page 8 and 9."
The rate listed are not the salary of the Gurkha officers.The rates are what the Police receives from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for the services of Gurkhas in MAS. See: https://d.pr/i/P8tDAI
"Thank you! :) .Thanks for the update, will amend appropriately."
"I believe those rates are payable to MHA if a private organisation wants to hire Gurkhas, not what MHA pays the Gurkhas."
"Ahh okay...thanks for the update, will amend appropriately."
"Assuming they don't get maimed or killed on the job, they will have spent their late teens/early twenties being taken care of by one of the best health care systems in the world. With a decent(for Singapore) salary, which is probably upper middle-class level back there. And their kids can even study here too(notwithstanding more recent slips in standards). It's a pretty good gig for them. And they still have their thirties/forties left to peddle their skills, or travel or do whatever. Again, in good health."
We should be following the UK and granting citizenship to Gurkha's who serve in Singapore for a long amount of time.

"Is there a way for a child of a Gurkha to gain citizenship? Reading the comment from the daughter of a Gurkha, it sounds so unfair that she might not be eligible to be a citizen despite having her entire life here."
"The reason why the Gurkhas and their children are not allowed to gain citizenship is because having ties to the country defeats the purpose of employing them here. The child can gain citizenship only after his/her parent's contract is done, but they have to go through the bureaucratic process like everybody else."
"I agree with the necessity of them having no ties to the country for them to do their work, and I guess I just feel bad for their children who have to deal with a really serious identity crisis."
"I read a book about the Gurkhas in Sg. The children are not allowed to acquire citizenship. I don’t think they are even allowed to work in Singapore after completing their studies.Once their father has completed his term as Gurkha police in Sg, they have to return to Nepal."
"This true, I myself is a proud son of a Gurkha. I was born in KK hospital and in my birth certificate it states that I am not given citizenship.Lived in Singapore for 19 years and I do call Singapore my first home and Nepal my second home. If I was given citizenship when I born I no doubt would be willing to serve NS and live there. But it can't be done and we have to go back home, which I think I did cried when I left Singapore to go back to Nepal knowing that I am still a foreigner in my own motherland and in my birth country Singapore.However, that being said I do cherish my time and memories growing up and going through the struggles as a normal Singaporean kid did during their childhood days."
"What you said is exactly the experience that I read about. I find it very sad that our government does not offer an opportunity for the children of Gurkhas to serve and obtain a citizenship. You spend almost your entire youth here, then go back to Nepal as almost a stranger.Just curious, did the government also restrict you from coming back to Sg to work as an expat? Or is this for forever closed?"
I could come back in Singapore as an expat ( which I am trying to do so at the moment). But I did visited Singapore a few times over the past five years but as a tourist.Plus I am really happy that we don't have to apply for visa when visiting Singapore which is awesome.
I wish you all the best in your journey to return home as an expat.
"Thanks mate, I don't know why but every time I come over I just feel it home."
That’s great to hear! All the best in coming back.
"When you come back, allow us to buy you a welcome home drink(or the equivalent, if you don't)."
Nah you don't have to as I might just be stuffing myself with all the Singaporean food that I carve time to time 😂 (but thanks for the offer tho).
"Yup, had a sec school junior who went back to Nepal."
"Don't think so, because Gurkhas are supposed to be a ""neutral"" force that can defeat riots, they're not supposed to be locals. Respect to them."
"I think I read about or watched a video once, about interviewing old Gurkhas in Nepal who used to kick it here. They could speak the local languages no problem"
"Unfortunately this is a real problem the Gurkhas face wherever they serve. Case in point, Lachhiman Gurunghttp://www.badassoftheweek.com/gurung.htmlI recommend you read the whole thing and realise that’s not the exception, that’s the norm for Gurkhas, but the pertinent but is in the last few paragraphs"
Very humourously written 😂
"Gurkhas do the dirty work none of our regulars or NSFs want to do. Patrolling forested areas searching for illegal immigrants? Gurkhas. Long hours protecting installations and doing security checks? Gurkhas. God knows if or when we get our first terrorist attack it won't be Procom or any of our dime a dozen optics-focused NS units taking charge.It's a good thing that they're mercs with no attachment to Singapore. Money is a far better motivator than patriotism, which we as a country also demonstrably lack."
"During my vocation training after BMT, my platoon happened to have a few Gurkhas. These guys are easily getting IPPT Gold (<25 years old standards) despite being over 40.They are also some of the nicest and most helpful people."
Merc pledge allegiance to the highest bidder. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Good thing we are pretty rich
speak for yourself!
"""we"" = SingaporeI'm not individually paying for the ghurkas lol."
"Except Gurkhas in particular have a history of keeping to contracts, professionalism, and discipline. They are pretty much The Unsullied but with testicles."
And quite big ones.
Money is a far better motivator than patriotism
they could fight the battlesthat we never could
"Huh... What makes you think our units are not prepared to respond to terrorist attacks? Different units have different purpose that they are trained for, our chemical defense unit would respond to any bomb threats for example. Just because everyone has their designated roles doesn't mean we do not want to do the roles other are assigned to, simply because we are trained for different scenarios, such assertions are false and highly misleading."
"Aside from SOF and STAR, none of our special ops units really have any exposure or real experience with the stuff they're trained to do. The last few times someone had to step up, they either couldn't (see: Little India Riots), or didn't (see: Shangri La).Myself and many of my friends were posted to special ops units across both the SAF and SPF during our NS stints, and our experiences were more or less similar. Uninspired regulars who (mostly) see themselves as condemned, leading NS boys who couldn't care less, headed by ladder climbers trying to pad their portfolio.Nothing in our 2 years of experience with these units gave us confidence that they would respond well if push came to shove. It's easy to have rigorous training plans, regular exercises, pressed uniforms and shiny new equipment. It's another thing to execute in real situations. That's why experienced fighting forces have such an advantage over freshly trained units in almost any given setting.Unless the regulars have some super secret ultra-warrior mode that they keep hidden from NS personnel, I'll believe in our our own capabilities when I see them."

"Money is a far better motivator than patriotismwait, so u r saying if another country wants to attack us, and gurkhas happen to be part of our of defence, they can simply just pay the gurkhas more money to get them to also attack us?"
"When I was in HTA for basic police training, we would pray for rain so that morning PT will be cancelled and we can go for breakfast straight or go back to our bunk.But Gurkhas be like, ""Bitch Please"" carrying huge log on both their sides, iirc a pair of long log is carried by 3 or 4 gurkhas and will be running around HTA in the pouring rain.Inter divsion games, Gurkhas defeat even the elite like SecCom, STAR or the SOC.They are some very tough mofos but are very gentle and always smiling at you."
Cb since when can train under rain in HTA sia?
"Nobody can train, except them... No rules for Gurkha bro... Their morning PT is like fucking crossfit and it starts at 6.30am. When we just start to come down to the parade square for flag raising, they are already warmed up and start their PT. I was in HTA in 2012, maybe it's different now"

"I read about the history of Gurkhas in Singapore last year in the library. It was a fascinating discovery.The commander in charge of the Gurkha contingent in Sg has been and still is a British officer.In fact, the boys have to go through a “test” in Nepal. If they passed, they will be shipped to either one of three countries — England, Singapore and for the life of me I can’t recall the third one.England take majority of the boys, followed by Sg.MHA does everything to take care of them once they are here, to the extent of bringing their wives and kids over and giving the children education.But once the father has commented his term as. Gurkha Police, he and his family must return to Nepal. Even if the child studies till university, he/she must return home after graduation."
How long is a typical contract for them?
"Almost for life. Being successfully chosen as a Gurkha is a major pride for their family, and also a way to escape poverty.They start off almost at the age when we become nsf, and leave at the same retirement age in MHA I think.Some of them when they go back to Nepal, they have money to build a house and its interesting to see them design and decorate it with a touch of Singaporeaness."
It would be 25 years of service in Singapore.
"There's only the UK and SG.You might be thinking of Brunei, but they serve as the Gurkha Reserve Unit over there. The thing is, the unit is made up of British Army veterans.India also has their own contingent."
"Ah yes India, that’s the one!"
Quite a dumb political move. Pretty much no one has any problem with the Gurkhas. Half the population goes through NS and would typically come out with nothing but respect for them.
Wanna stir shit also got better shit to stir. It's not helping the credibility of opposition parties.
"ya sia knn i fucking pissed when opposition people say some dumb shit. you lot already fighting uphill battle as it is, why must sabo ownself"
"If the shit you stir is too credible, you get fixed. How do you remain in power? By culling decent opposition and leaving only the jokers around."
"If the shit you stir is too credible, you get fixedYou mean people like Chee Soon Juan and Han Hui Hui and Alex Tan got 'fixed' because they were ""too credible""? And that the people left behind like Low Thia Khiang are ""jokers""?Who were you even thinking of when you made that statement?"
maybe Operation Cold Storage/Spectrum?

"honest questions, why do some of them look like local singaporean? always imagine them to be bearded, giant like figure wielding machete lol"
"I have never not seen a clean shaven Gurkha, even in photos from WW2. They are quite a diminutive people. Also, they use kukris."
Bearded what are you confusing them with sardars
"Putting the identity of the poster aside, the use of Ghurkas does objectively contradict the statement ""we cannot outsource our security and defence to anyone else; we have to defend Singapore ourselves.""Just saying."
"The whole point of having ghurka forces is to provide racial impartiality when it comes to racial riots, especially with the racial history in Singapore. Ghurkas are mainly deployed in high risk situations where racial tensions may escalate. Having ghurkas as the law enforcement prevents situations like in the states where police discrimination are national issues.This virtue of racial impartiality is something that no amount of money in the world that can be had just by hiring locals.So I would argue that you can't really outsource something that you cannot do on your ownIf your plumbing is not working, and you have no knowledge of how to fix it is it considered outsourcing?"
"Your argument made sense but to attack her argument, we don't even need to go that farPM Lee was talking about defending against external threat. Gurkhas are deployed to law enforcement side, not SAF. Her argument missed the context of the speech."
Happy cake day
"If having a racially impartial force is absolutely neccessary, then the original statement ""we cannot outsource our security and defence"" is wrong because clearly we do need to outsource it.Besides, if even after the past 50 odd years of living together, we don't have enough faith in our institutions and each other to be impartial without having a foreign police unit here, then I'd be really disappointed. This is the kind of thinking that breeds distrust and division, which we should be moving away from rather than reinforcing."
"We need to remember that Gurkhas were used to protect LKY and his family when the 4th Malaysian infantry brigade stationed in Singapore “joked” about killing LKY after the separation.I’m not surprised if there is martial law, PAP will prefer to use Gurkhas to enforce law and order and not regular police and SAF as that’s mostly NSF based anyway. Even if there’s a strong regular contingent there’s also a chance of mutiny because brother will not want to shoot brother if they can help it. Gurkhas won’t have this problem.The whole Gurkhas are much more proficient than our own Singaporeans is a red herring. If it’s really an issue of proficiency then we would have put Gurkhas in SCDF as well. I mean, this is an area where there is regular danger and where proficiency actually matters more compared to our paper army and lack of violent crime in Singapore."
"The Ghurkas really remind me of Louis XVI and his swiss guards during the french revolution tbh. Understandable from a self preservation standpoint, but not exactly the best PR move."

Doesn’t that line mean we can’t depend on other countries to step in if we’re under attack. Is a Gurkha contingent under the command of the SPF really at odds with the sentiment.
"Come on la, it's not meant to be taken 100% literally. Singapore also buys equipment from other countries, if we literally don't outsource then we should be producing everything ourselves. Then also cannot perform joint military exercises or train overseas cos cannot outsource. We have Ghurkas in Singapore but we pay them and expect them to be loyal and professional, we don't go asking them for help and hoping that they protect us."
I find Janet's argument nepalling.
"""Politician"" is misleading, it's just some random irrelevant minor opposition party."
"Sounds like special pleading for Ghurka. ""Defence cannot be outsourced to other countries"". ""But what about Ghurkas?"" "" oh that one diferrreeeeeeent"" Then followed by ad hominem attacks. So why the special pleading for Ghurkas?"
"Unless MHA is talking about defense, Defense usually imply it is defense against external threat. Her argument and other's defense don't make sense, considering the context of PM Lee speech.If she went for the route of "" is having a foregin police force, that is purposely actively not to integrate in Singapore community and with no connection to the community ,needed in our country?"", she might not received that many backlashs"
So we cannot trust ourselves to protect against ourselves but we can trust ourselves to defend against others?
We don't really trust ourselves to defend against other anywaycoughrsafcoughAnd I have problem with how Gurkhas is managed in Singapore.I am not defensing our government on this. I am pointing the flaws of her argument and her approach.
Cos there's a northern neighbour with similar racial mix as us that can stir up shit along racial and religous fault lines . Just for shits n giggles.
"The big question is whether we can trust ourselves.If we cant, i dont see how the pistol and rifles held by the gurkas can fight against the tanks and gpmgs held by Singaporean."
I don't think you want to find out... A gurkha held off 30 Taliban and had the mental capacity to be able to use his machine gun tripod to fight them off. Another fought off bandits with his kukri when they held up his train with guns. And you expect them to be scared of tanks?
Taliban don’t have the same equipment and training as SAF recruits.If you think Taliban has the same fighting prowess as SAF then I think we’ve screwed up.
It's not about the equipment or training. It's their fanaticism that sets them apart from a proper military force. That alone makes them a dangerous enemy.And are you mad? Sending 30 soldiers against one gurkha?!?!?! What kind of lop-sided battle are you expecting? We need at least a hundred men to have a chance against that Gurkha!
This is like that *insert badass of choice* vs Silverback gorilla game. You'd need at least 360 men to overwhelm one ghurka.
"GPMG with 2000 rounds(in ammo box) is around 100kg total, iirc. And a tank usually requires more than one person, if you want to move and shoot at the same time."
"Really, no one needs to plead on the Gurkhas behalf. Their legacy speaks for itself."
Special pleading here is referring a logical fallacy.https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/163/Special-Pleading
"actually the question is of the prime minister not of gurkhas, if he thinks Singapore should not rely on others then he should turn his words into actions. I think that was the pont she was trying to make but it was missed by most."
Can’t give citizenship cause not CECA. Security work means not paper qualification which what is more important according to gov.
Maybe that's why her vote share dropped from 41% to 28% in GE2015... more than national average

I'd rather pay $20 for an obscenely large amount of data like 50GB than 'unlimited'. Anyone knows at what point the other telcos offering similar plans start to throttle speeds? Heard its 20GB for Circles & ZeroX.
"As far as I know Singtel offers ""unlimited"" 50GB for around $80 but you're tied down to a 2 year contract. M1 has unlimited too but from their website they look much more expensive than Singtel's (cheapest is $98 on a 2 year contract).For no contract Circles offers $20 for 20GB ""unlimited"", MyRepublic offers ""unlimited"" data according to the plan you subscribed to just like Zero1 (first X GB on 4G speeds).Of course the most worth it is TPG's currently since it's free with ""unlimited"" 2GB data which resets everyday."
Just keep in mind these are comparing data-only
"StarHub's ""Unlimited Weekend Data"" cap is 10GB. Upon reaching 10GB of use, the speed is throttled. It's within their FAQs / Terms and Conditions."
Hmm.. can't find this on starhub app. Is this just for the December new sign ups??
Yup you must be on the new plans

"Thank you! Bought and received my drone in mid nov, been working on this ever since!"
Bloody good job on this. You made the city look amazing
Thank you! I tried my best!
What the fuck?? This is so well done!!
Hahah love your reaction. Thanks man!Was just trying my best to make it not suck.
"No, no it’s not suckish I don’t even have the patience to wait for the 10-minute MRT, you are a legend!"
"Hahhah thank you, am just a guy eat full nothing better to do lah."
Lmao if I got nothing better to do I would play games lmao
"wow like professional do one, nice one dude. love the scene cuts according to the beat"
"Thanks man. I'm just an amateur with a drone though, still far from calling myself a pro!"
"Thanks for gold, whoever gave it. But please don't spend anymore money on imaginary icons, consider donating it to charity if possible!Some of the smaller ones like animal shelters are always in need of help!!Edit: Dude wtf don't give plat either"
Don't tell us what to do. continues giving gold
Take ALL MY UPVOTES
Yessss give me all your powerrrr
UNLIMITED POWER!
Po po po po powahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
"I'm guessing only the new mavic could do this hyperlapse feature right?Its the only thing that really got me interested in buying one.Good job OP, editing must had taken you a bloody long time."
"Yes I think only the new mavic 2s has got this, would have taken forever to individually click each shot with the old mavics.Processing, stabilizing and editing was a pain that I upgraded my pc to try and save some time! #blackfriday"
What's your setup and what program did you do the editting in?
"Edited in premiere pro.Upgraded pc to amd ryzen 7 2700x, 32gb ram, 1gb nvme ssd.Reused my old psu and gtx 970 graphics card (waiting for prices to drop)"
I APPRECIATE YOU !
NO I APPRECIATE YOU FOR APPRECIATING ME!
I APPRECIATE YOU MORE
NANI?!?
Looks really professional. How long does the drone have to fly to do 1 pan? E.g. the Singapore Flyer pan
"Thank you! That pan shown was about 20mins, which is basically the entire usable flight time because you gotta leave abit for take off and landing safely."
Ah yeah wouldn't want to be fishing your drone out of the kallang basin. Haha. Thanks for giving us a cool view of singapore!
And thank you for watching!
"Holy fuckballs this is amazing. I watched it on my phone but want to rewatch on big screen, absolutely beautiful.What is your next project going to be?"
"Thank you! Please try to watch in 4k if your device allows it.I have no clue yet actually, still waiting for inspiration. Maybe a cat video..."
Bravo bro! Check out https://fstoppers.com/timelapse/cool-flow-motion-video-singapore-320339 for your next inspiration ;)
"Thanks bro. I have seen that, but my dslr is a dinosaur from 2011... considering selling drone and kidney to buy a new mirrorless....."
"Or not need dslr, use only Mavic 2 Pro for bao-kai-lioa shooting lol"
Sibei idea... but i don't know if i can tahan the looks of shame :(
Btw do share your work @ https://forum.dji.com Mavic section too.
"Oh i submitted it into the skypixel contest, which is run by DJI themselves."
Unfortunately skypixel won't showcase in the forum. More like minded forumers will appreciates it. Like the recently one by local singaporean which was featured in the main page https://forum.dji.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=180698 :)
"Okay, just posted it there, thanks for the suggestion!"
"Your video has made me appreciate what we have here in Singapore more, thank you for that! This is so great that I think Singapore Tourism Board should take a look at this."
"Thank you. STB actually has looked at it, and shared the vid on the visitsingapore fb page as well.They were really fast actually, I think they dm-ed me within 24 hrs of when I posted."
Wow I’m amazed at their efficiency but beyond that I think it’s because your video is of such a high standard. Kudos to you!! 👏🏻
"Yeah I also had the impression that gov agencies move slowly, but they amazed me!Cannot say gov do things very slow anymore liao..."
I think the social media pages is run by 3rd party agency
Just watched this during a drone workshop I attended recently.
Wah really? Which one?
Holy shit this is fucking sick great job!
Thank you! Tried my best!
Just... holy
Glad you enjoyed!
"Singapore is truly beautiful and you are amazing :) you may want to put this on r/cityskylines for extra karma, you deserve it!!!"
"Thank you, yes I think the skyline is underrated next to other iconic ones.I will try some other subs too, thanks!"
Looks like u did some colour correction as well. I assume you took the shots over a period of time and not just one night? Kudos cos they all look seamless!
"Yes, there's a heavy grading on it that my brother calls weird, but I was inspired by all the cyberpunk futuristic stuff now.Shot over 3 months, I only had 3 batteries and 1 battery basically = 1 sequence, max 2. Many scenes had to be reshot cos too windy but you couldn't tell until the clip is put together in post"
How many days did you take to capture all the footage ? Is it all taken in one night ?
"I went out for 25 nights in total, over 3 months. So a couple times a week basically.But some weeks rained so didn't go out, and some weeks went to fly like 4 times a week."
"Nice, please produce more of such creations"
"Thank you, but I feel like a sequel is only gonna disappoint leh, the nice angles I can think of are used liao.Maybe if the gov raises the height limit I can try again."
You have only out do yourself. Easier written than done.Have Faith.
Indeed... Have to dig deep and try again!
This is brilliant. Very very well done!
Thank you very much!!
Awesome!!! Splendid!!!
Thank you!! Why muzitbnutz though
This seems like something off a video game. This is beautiful
"Thank you! Yeah I can't deny the video game influence, since I basically spent the other stupid amount of time playing them."
Very impressive
Thank you very much!
"For what it is worth, I would say that you did a fantastic job making this, this looks awesome."
"Thank you, much appreciated! Biggest fear photogs have are spending a ton of effort and nobody seeing it."
Our home
"Indeed, our home!"
Well done you! It’s absolutely stunning..!
Thank you kind sir/mdm/attack helicopter!
"Finally something better than the fucking boring ""hey look here is sunset at (insert name of hdb heartland)"" shots"
I guess I should change my plans of doing sunset hdb shots for next vid...
I truly appreciate this work of art. Well done!
Thank you very much! Much appreciated!
"I hv a silly qns. If u don't watermark, what happens if someone steals your video and uses it in say a promotional video for a travel agency?"
"I have a small watermark at the corner, but I've not had anything successful before so I wasn't too worried about that initially..."
This is awesome! If possible I want to give you a dozen upvotes.
I receive your thoughts and will multiply it by a dozen in my head! Thank you x 12!
"shit this is damn amazing OP i take my hat off to you, hope some company or maybe STB comes to buy this from you so you can monetize your hours spent and make it more worthwhile :D"
Thanks! That would be nice. If not then also a good learning experience lah.
You need to make more!!!! 😍
I will try!! Thanks for watching!
"Singapore: EndgameGot reminded of Avengers somehow while watching this, perhaps due to the purple-ish colour."
Now that you mention it... It does remind me of Thanos...
"Great! But to increase the number of views, i think you need to change the title.."
"Have to admit I'm not good with titling my videos, how should I do it?"
"Phenomenal stuff buddy, the movement, the framing, the angles you chose, the rotation and the edit to the music. Everything was so gorgeously executed. This genuinely must’ve taken forever to shoot and edit! My absolute favourite thing of all has to be the colour grading you’ve done. That deep rich blues and purples just set the tone perfectly for the vibe of the overall video! Love it!"
Thank you very much! My favorite part of this is seeing how much enjoyment other people get from watching the video!
Amazing! What video editing software did you use and what filters / grading setting ?
"I used adobe premiere and AE. Didn't use any filters, basically just trial and errored my way to this look.I already wanted to try and make the vid a cyberpunk inspired colors from the start, so just a matter of tweaking my way there."
This is awesome
Thank you! You are awesome!
"Great editing. Love the shots. Though I wonder if you tried balancing the colours.Regardless, brilliant job done! Thanks for sharing!"
"Yes, different nights actually had quite different exposure and color temps because of moon, clouds, distance to subject, etc.Had to balance back in post. Hope I did a decent job at it."
This is incredible. Should definitely xpost this to r/videos or something!
"Dunno man, it's basically impossible to get any response there... So many people posting all the time."
You gotta believe! Haha this deserves all the views man. The lights at night are my second favourite part of SG!
Wah ok maybe I'll try it if reddit doesn't block me from posting new submission so soon
This is so coool. Great job man
Thank you!!
"Damn son, sick video! I'd say the stupid amount of time is really well spent.Hope you can do some heartlands shots in your next project :)"
Thanks dad!I will try some heartlands next time but it won't be bedok bedok...
"Very professional, nice work. Beautiful city"
Thank you! Not a pro but I appreciate the encouragement!
"Ehh, wasn’t this video posted like 2 days back!!"
"I did upload it on Monday, but youtube didnt get traction. Only the fb version got shared by smartlocal and visitsingapore."
"Well..... this time round, your post is redhot!! Fantastic work nonetheless!"
"Oh you meant post it to reddit? The other poster wasn't me, but he should have gotten the karma!"
Please change your caption thanks. Plot twist clickbait
"Um ok, which part?"
"Did you modify the color--Singapore isn't really that purple at night, is it?"
"Yes, it's coloured in post. It's more orangey in the original.I actually had to lower the color saturation from some clips like mbs because their colours were too strong."
"Great video! Did you happen to use a LUT? If so, which one?"
Beautiful!
"Facebook links are not allowed on this subreddit.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns."
"Very nice, though personally I think the random speeding up and slowing down (both within the same scene) in the first half or so is a little distracting."
"I can agree with that, i regret that I should have caught that before posting..."
This is fire🔥!!
Thank you! 🔥🔥🔥
Brilliant work
Thank you! Username checks out.
"Damn, it is so beautifully done. Very awesome OP!!On the other hand, did you colour grade the video during production? I love the purple glow, looks so futuristic"
"Thank you!Yes, colour grading done in post. I guess think of it as after meitu-ed.I'm a fan of the cyberpunk colors so I tried to grade it that way!"
What are the buildings at 0:04?
"That's the interlace residential condo, off queensway."
Can I ask when these shots were taken? I was in Singapore this August for a couple months and I miss the city badly. This is a great reminder of how cool the city looks at night!
"They were shot between nov to feb, when the nights were nice and cool.Come #visitsingapore again!"
One day I certainly will! Thanks!
Wahhh makes me feel bad about my poor editing skills haha. Great job!!!!!Now I'm inspired :D
"Ehhh everybody starts somewhere. I literally just youtubed how to get a grid in premiere today, just keep experimenting!"
you have this then you have some stb ads
"Hahah...... I wonder if stb is reading this also... (if you are, pls buy my clips)"
Jin swee
Kam sia welly much
Deus Ex!
"I actually didn't play the game, is it like that?"
This is such a beautiful portrayal of Singapore. Truly a city that comes alive at night and you captured the iconic city scape so well. Please post more of your work and not just in r/singapore. More people should see this.
Thanks for your kind words. I don't know if posting it everywhere flouts reddit rules though...
You seems like the kind of guy that can take videos of me lying down in bed and edit the video to get more gold.. damn man.. you talented
Ehh I don't know man... I'm not that good.I just tried to steal a ton of ideas from everywhere and try to make them gel somehow.
Holy shyat this is awesomeee!!
Thank you! You're awesome!
"it's really well done, but is it me or is the video not really crisp? I'm on 4k on a 1440p monitor, the video looks slightly fuzzy at times."
"I'm sorry but I think it's the footage being fuzzy either from youtube compression or the source material being blur cos the camera was flying in the air.I thought most was sufficiently sharp but I can't know for sure cos although I exported 4k, my monitor is only 1080p."
Just sell it to Singapore Tourism Board already.
"I hope they'll wanna buy too.Hello STB, you know where to find me!"
Wait... This is Singapore? I live in Singapore! Why doesn't it feel as magical as this when I walk by the Singapore flyers! ~~~Jokes aside great work! I really liked what you did with both the video and editing. The only part I didn't like was the sudden camera jerks at the start of the video that you synched with the beat. It felt really jarring imo but other than that everything was great. How long did it take for the entire process from recording to editing?
"Yeah I can definitely understand that - the speed ramping was very subjective for myself as well, but I felt like it was too plain without. Difficult decision.Whole process took about 3 months, mostly bottlenecked by the fact that I only had about an hour of flight time each night due to batteries."
Neat
Thanks
Yo Singapore Tourism Board should hire you and use this video for its promotional purpose sia. This was masterfully done huge respect man!!!
"Thank you, they've seen it already! But never say wanna hire me yet leh :("
"U shld post this on a videography subreddit!! Promote Singapore and your work haha Well done OP, this is really good. 👌🏻"
I'm subbed to r/videography but I don't know if it's relevant to there...If it gets 0 upvotes and disappears I'll be very sad and disappointed
I really really love this. I fly a mavic pro too. Maybe we can get together and fly someday!!!
"Thank you very much! I gotta take a break from flying for awhile, flying overload. When do you usually fly?"
bloody hell is this amazing!! i think the government’s gonna wanna give you some coin to use your material in future ads and campaigns 👌🏾
Thanks man! I hope the government sees your post and thinks the same!!!
May I ask what drones to you use ? And how much did it cost you . Roughly how many hours of footage did you edit this video from ?
"I used the mavic 2 pro with flymore combo (2 extra batts), cost about 2.5k.Can't really count the length of footage because for time/hyperlapses, the raw images are actually individual photos then combined together into video sequences.But IF I had been shooting in video form, I guess it could have been around 75 hours worth?"
DAMN. Beautiful. Thank you!!!
Thank you! Appreciated.
This should be added to Apple TV areal wallpapers!
Is there such a thing? I wonder if I can sell them my clips lol
"Yes, they are beautiful. As your work. But they are plain areals, without effects."
I will try searching and see if they want my clips without the effects! Thank you for letting me know about this!
WHAT THE FUCK THIS IS AMAZING!! What drone did you shoot this with??
Thank you!! This was shot on the Dji mavic 2 pro.
Gorgeous! This makes me even more excited for our trip next month!
"Welcome! Bring light breathable clothes, it can get really hot and humid sometimes!"
Impressive . You have a instagram page where you post stuff like this ? I admire the effort people put into a picture or video of the scenery especially Singapore's.See from your profile that you are a Manchester United fan too ? Hopefully we win on Sunday against Liverpool.
"Thank you, yes it's under my same username.Hell yeah, gotta return them the favor for the 3-0 previously!"
It’s incredibly beautiful 😍😍😍 amazing job!!
Thank you very much!!
"this is amazing man. you've made me proud to show off my country to brit friends 🇸🇬 :D> med student, studying abroad"
"That's great! I just hope they don't get too high an expectation from the vid, it's like profile photo vs real life person is different you know."
Man you got some pretty breathtaking photos and edits on your instagram especially your drone footage of Singapore. Followed.GGMU!
Thanks for the follow! GGMU
r/outrun here’s your city
Yasss that's my people right there
Power la!I wish I would actually bring my drone out. Bought it and only flew twice downstairs and now collecting dust lol.
"Thank you!Eh i can totally get it, i haven't touched my drone either since completing shooting..."
That was wicked 👌 well done
Thank you my dude!
I think your work truly deserves a better recognition or platform.. I mean i don't know.. I had to re-watch it and show to everyone hoe amazing this is! I appreciate Singapore in a different light now. So so so dopeeee
"Thank you! It's got 2k shares and 95k views on the fb version, so its something i guess.No clue how to get more people to watch it anymore though."
"Watching it in camp right now, can't wait to book out so i could watch this in 1080p. This shit is good!"
Yay thanks! It's available in 4k! Try it if your device allows it!
Well done! I really liked the Singapore Flyer at 1:00. I do think that you might be better without the diagonal zoom outs at 0:11 - just my 2 cent.
"Yes, I am planning on that. Luckily the summer clothes are starting to be available in the stores here, so I am shopping a bit. I’m saving some money for shopping there too! 😉"
"Well there's tons to stuff to buy here too, come with an extra suitcase!"
Amazing! I need to book another vacation to this wonderfull city.
This is amazing!
You should be very proud of yourself! This is fantastic! Well done.
Damn... These shots are more colourful than any razer rgb lighting... Amazing editing and patience!! Thank you for the work! 😊👍
Shouldn't be surprising to anyone. the current batch on cpf was from the 50k(iirc) min sum era. Basically the pioneer gen who have the one shot return cpf and the medeka gen who had insanely low cpf sum. That's why the min sum was drastically increased. Problem should be mostly addressed once you see those born in the 70s start retiring
"Lol two groups of people see headline. One group thinks “bloodygahmen steal our money and give back so little, abolish cpf!” The other group thinks “wow this is why gahmen so smart raise minimum sum and change the drawout policy! Smart gahmen!”Really showcases how important driving narratives is in comms"
It's not called online shitizen if it doesn't sensationalise titles lol.
"In order to get an average $355 / month from CPF Life, you would need to have a saving of only $60,000 in your CPF retirement account assuming you were born 65 years ago i.e. around 1955.This is why minimum sum needs to keep increasing with lower lumpsum withdrawal aka the opposite of ""Return my CPF!!"". And people complain when minimum sum withdrawal age keep increasing.https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/LifePayoutEstimator/LifePayoutEstimator"
"Is this really true? My parents are sole proprietors and have been contributing a lot to CPF. Because recently, I’ve been reading through their statements, and find it sad if they can only get that little payout sum each other by the time they reach 65. Anyone can enlightened me?"
"Self employed mandatory contribution goes towards the medisave, which cannot be withdrawn as payout unless special circumstances. There is a cap for medisave iirc <50k?"
"If they have saved enough for the enhanced retirement sum of 264000 in their retirement account, they will receive about $2000 per month from age 65 till they die. You can log into your cpf and read more about this."
The min sum for that period is something like 50k that's why it's so low.
"Aannd somehow the online citizen is trying to stir shit again with something that is basically just a a reflection of realityPeople taking CPF today paid much less of their overall lower wages (the country had a much lower wages level back then) to a much lower minimum sum (50k) and so their payouts are pretty modest.If anythjng the numbers prove exactly why the government was right to increase mandatory contributions and minimum sum as the country got more prosperous - people are not adequately saving for retirement on their own and saving is a must to offset cost increases from a rapidly rising economy.CPF isn't magic, it won't make everyone rich in retirement but it's absolutely necessary for the vast majority of people given overall low financial literacy"
"Politics aside, does this prove, mathematically, that setting aside ~30% of your income into a safe investment with compounding interest isn't enough for a decent retirement in Singapore?"
I think you have to consider the fact that wages in the past were alot lower. People from the older generation tend to command lower wages and when coupled with the sharp increase in cost of living you end up with this scenario.
"Yeah, but inflation never stops so by the time we retire, whatever we're earning now will be considered low by then. I'm fully expecting to have to pay $10 - $15 for hawker (assuming hawkers still exist by then) chicken rice by the time I retire."
"Inflation has slowed significantly - don't know if you've noticed but wages have barely risen in the past few years. I mean, look, in 1980 your POSB bank account would have given you 9% in interest a year. We're living in a low growth low inflation low interest world now."
"Wages have been largely flat over the last 10 years because if you take a look at the trends, the starting pay of a poly grad tends to be pegged to the level of an S pass minimum wage.It is this uncomfortable reality, coupled with large numbers of angry, very vocal people that has the Singapore government nervously raising the minimum S pass wage (the educational level that most working Singaporeans are still employed at) every other year or so."
Wages have been largely flat over the last 10 years because if you take a look at the trendsWhat trends have you been viewing?Annualized median income has gone up 4-7% on nominal terms and 3-4% adjusted for inflation in the last 10 years.Source: https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/households/household-income/visualising-data
Wages and household income in Singapore continue to grow pretty healthily ahead of inflation for a developed economy. I see a lot of people parrotting stagnation there but that does not hold true. Most developed economies would kill for the wage growth across large parts of the population Singapore has experienced over the last decade.
"My comment was in response to the previous commenter's worries about inflation in the context of developing Singapore vs current Singapore. If you change the benchmark to other developed countries then obviously the conclusion changes. Context matters - it's all relative after all. Not sure why that counts as ""parrotting stagnation"" but okay."
20 years ago i paid $2 - $2.50 for chicken rice.Now i pay $2.50 - $4.50 for chicken rice.I'll retire in about 35 years assuming the goalposts dont move.
"I'm from that era, chicken rice costed 1.50 max back then, price tripled at least"
If it had increased proportional to inflation it would be 12$
"Well that's assuming wages remain stagnant. Stagnant wages may be a reality for low-skilled labour though.Even with inflation I'm not sure if prices will be inflated that drastically. Rapid modernisation in the past few decades drove prices up very quickly (e.g. 300% increase in cost of kopi), but sg's growth is probably going to plateau soon? Standard inflation rates of 2-3% per annum is easily covered by the interest rate of CPF.Then again I'm no economist so don't trust me on this."
"Wages don't really need to be stagnant for each generation to have relatively speaking low wages compared to the next.Say our generation started at 2k, and got ~5% increment per year till retirement. Today's generation starts at 3k, and if they also get ~5% increment per year till retirement, their lifetime earnings and CPF contributions will still be significantly higher than ours, the same way ours will be significantly higher than today's elderly, who probably started at like 1k or less.If cost of living plateaus then that might make the CPF payouts a lot more liveable, but I don't know what that plateau might mean for SG's economy, which might have an even bigger effect on our ability to retire."
"Relative wages between generations isn't really the point here isn't it? The main concern is the ability to retire comfortably. If our generation can retire comfortably even if we started at 2k, then the fact that the next generation started at 3k is really besides the point.By plateau I mean sustainable but not drastic growth. As the economy matures you don't really expect the boom that happened in the past few decades.But really the cpf payout isn't that horrible. With the current minimum sum you will get around 1.2k per month. An ""average"" retiree can live quite comfortably with that amount. Even in the worst case scenario where inflation halves the effective value, $600 in today's dollars isn't really too shabby. And that's for someone who earns a ""below-median"" wage and has no other savings other than cpf."
"When wages go up, prices will naturally follow. That's the point I was trying to make. It's old people whose wages were decent for their era, having to retire in our era where prices are set around much higher wages.1.2k per month is a liveable sum today, but the retirees of today aren't getting 1.2k, are they? Will 1.2k be enough for us, the retirees of tomorrow?I'm not saying that CPF doesn't dish out enough money or anything, since ultimately CPF can only slowly give you back what you put in to begin with, so its really a case of not having saved enough over the years. I'm just wondering how people who have contributed 30% of their income to retirement savings, that earns compounding interest at least on par with inflation, can end up with a monthly payout that's not enough to live on."
"Because a) the minimum sum was too low in the past, b) people drew out huge chunks of their cpf when they turned 55, c) they used their cpf to pay for housing, which means their money is locked into the value of their hdb, d) low education which means they were locked out of the better-paying jobs by the time they were in their 40-50s, which means that their monthly contributions did not scale well with the rapid increase in the cost of living"
fff no one should be expected to pay that much for hawker.
"When my dad was young and paying 20c for chicken rice, I bet he didn't think chicken rice would ever cost $4.50 either.But like someone else commented, this level of price inflation might plateau."
Yeah but when your dad was young 20c back then isn't 20c today.
"Apropos of this, I still have trouble talking to parents about this because they truly did not expect the cost of maintenance to go up. If there's anything that needs repairs they will wait until its completely urgent because they will not budge until they got the prices they are used to. :X"
"To add on, it was more common for people from that generation to hold odd jobs (which is why the whole gig economy thing is a concern). The womenfolk were also mostly housewives, with no cpf savings.It shld also be noted that many from that generation were in a good position to benefit from the property boom - a good instrument for capital gain."
It doesn't prove anything. The min sum from that period was around 50k. The excess were returned so you cannot use the payout as a gauge because those people get more cash back at 55.If they didn't manage the excess cash properly it's not the system problem its a personal problem. Reason why the min sum was drastically increased in recent years to address this issuePeople complaining about this are not seeing the full picture
the wonder govt pump out so many schemes for old pple
The old people was from the era where cpf was returned in one lump sum and the rest are from the era where min sum is insanely low. Reason why the group demanding return of cpf and lowering of CPF min sum are just clueless people who doesn't know their history
Was it mandatory to withdraw lump sum when they reached age during that era?
Yes. There was no monthly payout in the past
So what's her point? Is she going to help them or just kind of like FYI kind of update.

Phase 3 of the Mosquito Culling Universe
"It may sound counterproductive, but this is actually a good thing.These mosquitoes are carry no diseases. If they mate with a female, the resulting eggs are sterile and do not hatch. The intention is to have them outcompete Aedes mosquitoes from their resources, reducing their population and reducing disease rates.Basically, they are sterile, “clean” mosquitos that screw over the existing mosquito ecosystem to wreck the population of disease carrying mosquitoesStill gonna be itchy AF if they bite you though.EDIT: So apparently male mosquitoes don't bite. Never knew that. Even better then!"
Male mosquitoes don't bite.
They eat nectar. Only female mosquitoes seek blood.
Damn I never knew this. Guess that means only the female mosquitoes need to die
Wtf... male dont bite...
I hope this goes well.
"If by some chance a zombie apocalypse occurs, everyone should get prepared with some food, water and medicine supplies."
"As someone who lives in a block that has tried this, it is shittier than you may think. They put the breeding bottles right outside your windows and corridors and there are jungle levels of mosquitoes right at your doorstep.We have to keep the doors and windows permanently shut to keep the house livable. Sure the mosquitoes aren't supposed to bite but I assure you it is even more irritating when there are swarms of them buzzing around.Have you had the experience where you're trying to sleep and one of them flies near enough your ear to make a loud noise? Guess what's gonna happen every five minutes now.I've never had any issues with mosquitoes until they trialled this thing, and I can't wait for the trial to be over so I can open my windows again."
"What if I don't have aircon at home, wouldn't it be ridiculously hot to keep my windows shut? Is there an option for your household to opt out?"
"No, the whole area participates. The little black cans will be placed along the common corridor every couple of meters."
What if you decide to open your windows and heck care the trial?
"Nothing, you just have tons of mosquitoes in your house."
Haha imagine if someone did that and installed one of those electric mosquito zappers. NEA comes back to check on their pets and they be like -.-
"Oh yes I feel you. There were still a ton of biting aedes that plagued my house nearly everyday for a certain period, lifts were infested with them too. It wasn't only until about a couple months ago that all the biting ones disappeared."
my area has trialled it before but I didn't noticed the mosquito at all? hmm
So that's what those small black cans are

"I miss Borders. I'm talking about stores selling books, not stationery.Edit:Kinokuniya! (Ngee Ann City)Bras BasahAny other book shops come to mind?"
"Kinokuniya in Ngee Ann City, Orchard Road."
"I still find book depository way cheaper than kinokuniya though, especially with free delivery"
"Amazon can be cheaper than book depository sometimes. And they also have way better shipping time (under 2 weeks) if you pick the mid level shipping option, which is about 0.60 usd more. Whereas book depository can take almost a month to arrive."
"There’s a bookshop at Bras Basah called Basheer that sells a lot of graphic books. Like artbooks, concept, animation, design, interior design, architecture books."
Does it sell used or new books?
new
for used books I prefer the duo of book treasure at parklane and sultana at peace centre
Both actually. Depends on the condition the owner may give discount. Pretty cool place to get art books
Can I ask which floor in Bras Basah? Would like to see they selling 1 architecture book I'm looking for
"It's on the 4th floor of Brad Basah Complex, if you're taking the escalator up, it'll be on your right."
Kinokuniya probably
"Kinokuniya at Ngee Ann City, hands down.It's also not quite the same, but bras basah complex has a whole bunch of second hand bookstores that might be worth exploring."
Thanks for pointing out Bras Basah! Might be worth checking out
"I'm talking about stores selling books, not stationery.I feel you man. Still remember being confused af when the popular at clementi started selling laptops, appliances and assessment books but no actual books."

"I remember getting legitamately lost inside a kinokunya (I think in takashimaya or smth), idk if it's the same as the others mentioned (Im st00pid)"
I’ve worked in kinokuniya before. People get lost frequently and have to ask the staff for directions for the exit. You’re not the only one lol
I worked there too LOL! Some of them think we have a toilet in the store itself for some reason... and once I told some customers to go to d1 for some books but they went to d4 instead??? Haha
haha were you walking in circles?
"Haha, most likely"
"I was lost in the books, but it's understandable since the store is pretty massive!"
"not the biggest, but worth trying a local bookstore: BooksActually"
prefer littered with books for indie bookstores
"yep! just found it couple months ago, lots of interesting books there. hope they can survive though!"
Any good places to buy light novels? New or Used I don't mind.
"Liang Court Kino for Japanese LN, and Main store Orchard for English/Chinese"
Book depo/Amazon much cheaper than Kinokuniya if you want new books

"I leave my front door and windows open cos I don't have air-con. Smell of haze is really bad where I am now, in the Sembawang side. Anyone else smell it, or its just my imagination?Is it haze season already? I hope not."
Haze in central and western part too. Absolutely strong. Where to buy N95?
In the west and I smell it as well.
Feels like all parts of Singapore. I'm near the opposite end and it's terrible too.
I dont smell anything. Maybe it's my nose
Haze has a smell? Maybe you're neighbours are just burning again.
"There is that smell, slightly metallic and bitter smell in the air.Can't miss it from the days when the PSI went above 400."
The smell of the wrong wae. No really it stinks every time we get haze issues. The burn smell can be pretty strong at midnight
"I live in the west i haven't noticed any haze, if i smell burning at midnight it was always my neighbours at metal cans."
I'm east and the smell had been come and go since January. Was thinking might be just the usual cny period people burning offerings till this post shows up
"Till pics and proof shows up, i'll maintain my skepticism"
Probably OP's malaysian neighbour burning stuff again.
Woodlands here. Not smelling anything.
"Hi OP! in short, theres a petrolchemical factory across punggol that burns volatile gases and other toxic gases into less toxic gas.ill find the detailed reddit post about itthats has been the suggest reason for this smell as the burning and ignition of gas has been happening at a higher frequency"

Yes. People living in punggol are always going to suffer.

"Hi! I'm a recent poly grad with a GPA of 2.1 in diploma of chemical engineering and I know NUS/NTU/SMU are without a doubt out of my reach. I want to study journalism/communications and I know there are courses in SIM GE. But I don't really know much about the RMIT or UB journalism course at SIM. What's the difference and those who studied there which one is better suited in the long run if you were to pursue PR or tv journalism? Also, do students with these degree get hired into good companies? Because that's my only option right now and I don't want to waste my money on a degree that might get me nowhere."
I got my communications degree from UB.I think it’s a pretty good degree. Most of my friends go into PR/marketing etc. But I’m sure you can go into journalism with the degree. We some modules that emphasized on writing a lot so it should be ok.
Heard ond of thier graduates ended up in Cambridge Law
"UB Comms student here. A Communications Degree in UB would require you to finish 8 elective Communication modules on top of some mandatory modules that you have to take. Principles of Communication, or COM 101 is not included, but you must take that mod before going onto taking the other 8 Comms mods. PR, and Journalism are offered here too, in addition to many other communication-related mods that are equally interesting and fun.I don’t mind if you PM me and ask more questions. I’ll be glad to hep you :)"
"I got my comms degree from RMIT. I wouldn’t personally advise you to take it, honestly. The UB one sounds a lot better.If you need more info about my experience, feel free to PM me :)"
I graduated from Unisim night (SUSS) now and currently work in PR. If you have any questions feel free to ask via PM.

"Saw a Mercedes silver car parked around Eunos area with a car plate starting QA instead of the regular SXX. Doesn’t seem like a car belonging to an embassy, as it didn’t have a mount(for flag) at the front of the car.Anyone can explain? Didn’t manage to snap a picture as I was in a moving car going somewhere else."
"QA is a Sarawak plate, more specifically for Kuching. If I remember correctly malaysia allows their citizens to register their cars under any state, so it’s probably just a car from west Malaysia that decided to register for Sarawak.The letter at the back isn’t a checksum (which is the letter at the back of SG-registered vehicles), it’s just part of the sequence to expand the number of possible vehicle registrations. Eg. QA 1234 A, next one will be QA 1234 B and so on."
"This is the correct answer. Not just QA, as long as the car plate starts with Q, it’s from Sarawak. That person probably works in KL but registered his car under his state and drives to Singapore."
"I mentioned QA is for Kuching, although they’ve run out of that and are now using something else I believe. Something to note: police cars, LTA/NEA/TP vehicles in Singapore have plates that start with QX."
They ran out of QA long time ago. Almost every kid in Kuching gets their own car when they get their car license. It’s the rite of passage.
"Are you from Sarawak? That’s actually the norm for many countries, but because in Singapore our public transportation is relatively usable and cars are hellishly expensive it doesn’t happen here."
Q plates used to be issued for company cars long time ago so not necessarily from sarawak
Should be an old company car plate
Q plate used to be for cars registered to companies/businesses instead of individuals.
Any Malaysian plate that starts with S? Can masquerade as an SG car if so
Yep. Sabah plates start with S.
Yeah it felt really weird driving in sabah with all the S plates around with the letter at the back too.
i have a feeling that the person who own this car imported it from another country. they dont need to have a change of the license plate as they already have a permit to drive it around as its only temporary. i think the person shipped in their car -> drive it ard -> ship it back. correct me if im wrong
"Ok so I know this has been ask countless of times before, but I still can’t really make a decision yet. I visited NSC and 1 of the docs there recommended me CO2 fractional laser treatment, but he told me I would only see up to 30% improvement overall at most. He also showed me the before and after pictures of his previous patients, and tbh, 30% is really not noticeable. Also, my acne scarring isn’t that bad, but not exactly mild either. On the scale of 1-10, 10 being the worst, I would say my acne scar is about a 5/10. Also, the cost of treatment at NSC would be $5000 for 5 sessions, and only a 30% improvement as mentioned by the doc.Price is of no concern to me, in fact I would prefer if it is more reliable and more expensive, just that paying $5000 for 30% improvement is kinda wasted? I am willing to pay the $$$, just that the improvement should at least be 50% or more? Any recommendations? Cliffords? Niks Maple laser? Or others?"
"There's no single perfect clinic or doctor.Some are recommended because they're affordable (but requires long wait).Some because they are good at marketing themselves.Then there are those who are prominent because they pay 'celebrities' and 'influencers' to speak well of them.The truth is that they're all pretty much the same, so the main thing is to do your research and choose a doctor you trust. Sometimes it's a matter of picking a doctor randomly based on your budget and then finding out that he/she is pretty good and sticking with them.The truth also is that acne scars are very difficult to treat. No doctor will promise you a complete reversal. Once the skin is scarred, it'll never return to its original form.That's why usually the more invasive the procedure (aka the longer the downtime), the greater the improvement you'll see. You're basically regrowing new skin over time.Procedures like chemical peels and exfoliation will see little benefit.There are all kinds of acne scars - ice pick, rolling, boxscar etc. Do your research to find out what kind of scarring you have and the best kind of treatment for your type of scars.Most people require a combination treatment over a very long period to see major improvement.I won't give you false hope by saying your scars will disappear after X number of sessions you undergo. It's something you'll have to keep going back to over many years, with different treatments made possible over time through advancement in technology and medicine.Sorry if you were looking for a magic elixir - there isn't one."
"Yup I know about that. I just want to consider other options with higher yield, because I feel paying $5000 for 30% improvement isn’t worth it. I’m not expecting high improvements like 70+% either, although I have seen quite a fair number of people claiming that they achieve 70% improvement from certain clinics. Basically, price is no issue for me, I just wanted to see if there’s any well known and reputable clinics besides NSC for acne scar treatment."
"I went to NSC also, was offered either some sort of laser surgery or chemical peel. Chemical peel was more affordable for me, per peel a hundred or two.. It takes longer though, of course. And is probably less effective? If you do go to NSC again can ask about it."
Any side effects of chemical peel?
"Ehh, I can't remember exactly. They'll tell you about it before you do it. Also have to sign a form of some sort, forgot what it was. Probably indemnity form or for consent.I do remember that my face was reddish after the sessions, and sometimes blotchy patch of red. Was also told to avoid sunlight, probably because it would affect the healing process and cause pigmentation.The process itself is relatively simple, you wash your face there and lie down on a bed-thing. Then your doc will come in, the nurse passes them the chemical peel solution, and your doc starts painting your face with it. The solution is coldish, but (depending on the strength and your sensitivity) might feel some burn. The doctor will adjust that particular session's peel strength according to their judgement and your feedback/pain threshold. The more concentrated peels do feel painful, but my doctor started me off and ramped it up over a couple of sessions. Also, they pass you a handheld battery-operated fan, the wind helps lessen the pain, supposedly.I only went for like.. maybe 5 sessions, before I had work committments and couldn't take days off every month to head down for treatment. And my doc didn't work weekends or something, can't remember. So.. Yeah. I stopped treatment. I felt those 5 sessions helped though, but I wouldn't say my face is ""clear"" yet, honestly."
"Have you considered subscision? I did it and it worked pretty well, but you will probably need to pair it with laser treatment as well"
"Not yet, but the NSC doc did not recommend subscision."
You can ask them about it. Works well for anchored scars
"I went for co2 fractional laser treatments at tiffiny yang, paid abt 2k for 5 sessions. then did other facial treatments at another place. scars improved quite abit. so far so good."

I thought there was a report on Singapore interest in merkava tank?
No. Too expensive and not suited to our operational environment. Leopard 2A4 Made sense because we got them dirt cheap (google 'the great german panzer sale) post cold war when the german army was downsizing.
Is the Merkava too large to operate in a jungle environment?
It was never designed to shipped or air lifted
the great singapore buying spree
Those additional units could well just be the hull for AVLB and CET applications and thus no reported as tanks.
*AEV *L2-AVLB
"11 more than previously reported only, don't think it's anything special la, maybe some spare body for other stuff. I remember got some other vehicles also using the leopard body right?"
"""The Singapore Army has one active battalion of Leopard 2s, with additional vehicles assigned to training units in Singapore and Germany, where it uses Oberlausitz Military Training Area.""I wonder how many vehicles (in the broadest sense, APCs, tanks, choppers, planes) we have overseas, and whether these are operational enough to return to Singapore in the event of a military conflict."

"Weird flex, but okay.She can go ahead and pay more taxes, no one is stopping her."
"wow, so a young, relatively debt-free, dependent-free, kid-free, dual-income female who can actually afford to put more into her CPF than required, thinks she's representative of all middle-income Singaporeans in declaring the ability to pay more income tax. alright then."
"I agree our tax system could use some re-examining, but her arguments in her article are the epitome of privilege"
"Actually I felt similar after working overseas for a few years in Tokyo.I didn't see at least 30% of my salary due to taxes (and pension and various others), and on top of that I was paying at least 3 - 4 times more for transportation. And possibly 10x more for healthcare (contribution to the national health system is directly correlated with your salary, weird but it is what it is)Still, at the end of the day, I was happy to pay because I could see the tax dollars at work. The professionalism and diligence that is exhibited at all levels of public goods and services were exemplary, and I'd go out on a limb to say that this is because fair wages are being made to public servants/public service providers instead of contracting to the lowest bidder.Maybe it's an unpopular opinion, but it's mine."
Working in the states and more than 35% of mine is gone to taxes. I'd be extremely happy if I only had to wait 3 hours at the DMV instead of 7.
"How much worse are our public goods, services and servants?"
"A lot worse from my point of view based on my experiences with local mail delivery and transportation.But of course, I'm comparing Singapore, a developing country, to Japan, developed and also 3rd largest economy in the world, so it's not entirely fair."
"lol, you think Singapore the land of cheap labour will put the extra money in the pockets of the people instead of the government's pocket?"
"Well, I've never made a claim to the possibility of that, but the facts do point to the government needing more money to sustain/improve our public goods and services."
I would to if the money goes directly to help the less fortunate and not the bloated in-betweens. That's why i donate directly to charities.
for want of a better analogy/simile/whatever this writer is like the annoying kid who reminds the teacher when he forgets to collect homework

"Our top ministers and leaders, who are very far from middle-income, would do well to lead by example by hiking taxes on their own income category, or better still taking a pay cut in the name of inclusivity."
"FWIW, they did, in 2017, raise the highest bracket, which they are in, to 22% from 20%."
"Fair enough at least they put their money where their mouths are. But I'm still of the view that it is both economically and morally wrong to increase the tax burden on the middle-class, whose consumption fuels the economy."
Everyone says they are middle or low income. Sounds like a sociologist's essay - weak economic support behind a moralistic premise
The rest of us are gonna have to take a hard pass
Is this Jeanette Tan real?
No. Just no.
"Hey everyone, this might sound weird but I have a huge interest in the types of wards that SG hospitals have (CGH KKH SGH NUH KTPH) like Im interested to know what wards are available on each level of the hospital(Not the A,B, C class wards thing but like the medicine speciality for that ward/level or like any special wards like ICU)so if anyone works at these few hospitals could you list them down here?Thank you so much!P.s I am studying in an area related to Allied Health and wish to work in a hospital next time(I have a huge interest in hospitals)"
Iirc Sgh block 4 2nd level : dialysis centre/renal medicine 3rd level: burns unit/ ICU 4th level: cardiac unit/ CCU 5th level: respiratory/medical ICU 6th level: gastrointestinal 7th level: colo rectal? 8th level: medical oncology ?
"74 is mostly neuro 42 dialysis 44, 45 cardio 46 Gen surg and Psy 56 Gen surg and gen med 78 med onco 58/68 isolation wards (respi and ID) Only half of 58 is iso. The other half of 58 is gen med. 65/55 gen med 34 O&G - if I rmb correctly"
oh there are diff blocks in sgh?
Yeap!
Oh then do you know what wards are avail there?
"hi, welcome to allied health in a few years!this shows NUH's specialties, on which wards are based. of course there's not going to be a ward for dietetics, but onco, ob/gyn, ortho and hrm, paediatrics and all the headings under medicine and surgery are likely to be the specialities upon which wards are based + have allied health input. there's also the acute medical unit and emergency medicine, as well as outpatient services, which aren't exactly wards, but allied health staff may work in these areas as well."
Im actually studying to be dietitian haha and thanks for the input!Do you know what ward number is under which medical speciality?
Why ttsh not in your list?
Cos I interned there before so i know the wards hahaha
"The types of ward specialities varies from hospital to hospital but generally each hospital will have several common types of wards:ICU: Cardiology/medical/surgical (NUH have neonatal and pediatrics ICUs)High dependency wards (usually cardiology/oncology):Isolation wards: Negative pressure rooms for isolating patients with severe infectious diseases such as multi drug resistant bacteria such as carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE), or tuberculosis.General wards (general medicine/surgery)Speciality wards (e.g. neurology, oncology, orthopedic surgery)Cohort wards/cubicles: Designated wards/cubicles for patients with multi-drug resistant bacteria, usually for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).P.S. I conduct surveillance of infectious diseases in acute-care hospitals."
Wow thank you so much!which hospitals do you go to?
"I will be traveling to every public hospital for my current project but I have been to TTSH, CGH, NTFGH, SKH and NUH."
"Oh thats nice, do you like for example the ward number 19 for cgh is what ward?"
"It's been a while since I was at CGH but off the top of my head, ward 19 should be a general ward.The ward layout varies for every hospital but generally the ICUs and HD wards are located on the lower floors and the isolation ward is usually located in a separate area/floor away from the other wards (for infection control purposes)."
ah ok thank you!I might travel to the hospitals just to see which ward number is for what haha
"Me too tbh, it isnt weird dont worry. Im borderline obsessed with hospitals."
Do you work at any of the hospitals by chance?
"No, i'm a sec school student haha, but i wish i could."
"Contemplating on taking level 1 but I am aware how much time and commitment is needed, especially for the higher levels.So how much of a differentiator is the CFA in Singapore? Is it worth getting?"
CFA is damn hard sia. But if you succeed in getting then I guess you will be in high demand. All the best luck to you.
"Do you plan to do a masters in the future? Are you planning to do a less analytical role (sales, mid office, back office). If both answers are yes, then you should NOT do CFA.In my experience, CFA is a masters-equivalent certification. It is important especially for front office analysts to have it given that we are “slightly behind” due to NS. Alot of foreign analysts have minimum a masters. You can think of CFA as a part time masters, splitting it over 3 exams. It is also relatively cheaper and have a lower opp cost.It is also more relevant for future differential of candidates, especially for investment management. A portfolio manager don’t always need one but its a very good to have.Hope this helps!"
Are you working in the financial industry? Is your company sponsoring your CFA certification? What are your current credentials?
Still an undergrad but I am planning to take it in my final year since most finance concepts would be relatively fresh compared to taking it much later
"If you have to worry about remembering concept, in long run you will struggle working in finance. Maybe lower / junior role is fine but for career certifications is due to your expertise.Imagine get CFA but can’t do the work cause after awhile forget already.If you’re good, jobs will send and pay for you to get certification."
"Most of us take it while we are working, the company would sponsor the certification. If you can make it through a finance degree in the local Us the CFA exams shouldn’t be a problem.Focus on your GPA and getting a good internship. That is the number one priority, a good internship is worth much more than the CFA title."
I checked out the virtual career fair. Quite a lot of jobs but mostly are catered for F&B and customer service (no surprise since it's Changi Airport). Worth checking out if f&b/tourism is your thing.

Too bad no talent
i feel so sorry for the girl.... it makes me sad but even sadder knowing that some cases might not even get a chance to be reported
"SINGAPORE - A teenage boy lured his then 14-year-old classmate to a school toilet and molested her. The offender, who is now 16 years old, also grabbed the girl's wrist and forced her to sexually stimulate him in a school located in the eastern part of Singapore. The boy, who cannot be named to protect the girl's identity, pleaded guilty on Friday (Feb 22) to one count each of molestation and sexually exploiting a minor.He is now studying in another school. In April 2017 at about 1pm, the victim had just completed a Principles of Accounts class when the boy asked her to skip her next lesson and follow him. Deputy Public Prosecutor Muhamad Imaduddien said the girl initially refused but gave in after the boy pestered her.ADVERTISINGShe followed him to a male toilet and he led her into one of the cubicles. He then grabbed her left wrist and told her to sexually stimulate him. The DPP said: ""The victim tried to retract her hand but to no avail. She told the accused to stop but the accused ignored her."" The boy let go of her hand only after the girl told him to stop several times, said the DPP.ADVERTISINGHe then molested the girl but she pushed his hand away. The girl then left the toilet and returned to the classroom. Court documents did not reveal how the offences came to light but a teacher from the school later told the vice-principal (VP) about the incident. The V-P lodged a police report on May 5, 2017, the court heard. Defence lawyer Andy Yeo told District Judge Eddy Tham that his client was a young offender and that he regrets his actions . The lawyer also said the boy was a first-time offender who has fully cooperated with the authorities. Judge Tham called for a report to assess the boy's suitability for a probation. He is now out on bail of $8,000 and will be sentenced on March 25. Those convicted of molesting someone can be jailed for up to two years and fined or caned. First-time offenders convicted of sexually exploiting a minor can be jailed for up to five years and fined up to $10,000."

I'll go first. I think mental health is an overlooked issue here.
"thank you for your response. one of the topics i was gonna address was also about mental health, being one that went through a phase of depression myself."
No problem.
"I think it's pretty looked-at. but there is no audience to appreciate their work. (exposed to amount of work being done for mental health, for researching during pure literature in o levels)Just talk to any person above the age of 40.They mock and laugh at mental health in the face of adverts/newspaper articles/news sections about mental health and sometimes suicide.And that's a pretty huge chunk of our population."

"Write, record and put your stuff out there and hopefully you can find like-minded people to work with. Check out places like library@Esplanade, they have plenty of music and performing arts related material, and they also have rooms for jamming that you can bookTry make it a habit to keep writing and reading. If you have interests in something, keep pursuing it. Your work may not be good at first but you'll improve as you go and writing really helps with that. As the saying goes, ""the only difference between screwing around and science (or art for this matter) is writing it down."" Good luck dude!"
thank you for the positive vibes dude :)

Wait human trafficking issues? I did not know that’s an issue in Sg. Pretty jarring.
"Domestic workers, sex workers, construction workers. It’s in plain sight"
to poverty. Wealth gap. Exam pressure on children. Hyper competitive environment. Everything is regulated. One political party. Freedom of speech restrictions. Human trafficking and migrant labour conditions. Can only ride your bike at 10km/h.He might be the Singaporean NameWee

thank you for the advice :)
lack of community maybe
"They say the hip-hop is so tight in some cities because everyone lives in apartments on top of each other, that in any building there are a dozen wannabe rappers or djs; you can them hear through the walls, banging away and forcing the competition.*In SG we go to Reddit to ask what struggles are.Possibly the most fwp post I have ever seen.*From one of RZA's books"

"I predict the following may happen over time:cost goes up. Be it the direct produce or services or indirect cost like bus services or infrastructure, etc.rental yields may dip. Resale may also be affected. Across the board resale of MOP-ed bto may also be affected.Rental of private housing may see reduction of the prices but increase in take ups due to concepts like why rent hdb when private rent also dropping.3) locals quitting jobs or complaining about jobs where s pass gets hit. Due to less head count and more work load.More unorganized thoughts yet to be posted."
Rentals/Property - Wish that's true but WP holders impact is very low to zero.
"Well WP holders probably make up the chunk of hdb rentals.If that takes a hit, it can potientially affect resale prices due to less buyer for rental objectives.Affect rental prices due to supply and demand.Folks higher than WP holders may decide to rent from HDB owners instead of private causing a dip in private rentals.It's all linked."
My FT colleagues told me that private properties (condo) rental are dropping so fast that its only slightly more than HDB rental. Thats why most of them are staying in condos instead of HDB.
I also get info from.agents that hdb rental isn't doing that well due to supply and demand.There's more rental units than people looking.

"I think we should leave the WP & SP untouched, anyway locals are unlikely to take up their jobs even with good pay. The one who caused damage is the lightly regulated EP holders. With no CPF contribution from employers, it's no brainer who will you hire if a local demands same pay as an EP."
"I have to disagree with your last statement. My firm (headcount 200) always prefer locals/pr over ep simply due to the fact that there's less paperwork and more certainty in hiring. EPs are getting harder and harder to be approved and as an EP holder myself, finding jobs esp within the SME sector (backoffice) is not easy."
"Coming from big MNC background, looks like my assumption cannot apply to all sectors. I had only worked once in a 800-strong local retailer, and the HR will die die go for EP - the locals are there to fulfill quotas. May be someone can jump in here with their experience."
"nd the HR will die die go for EP - the locals are there to fulfill quotas. May be someone can jump in here with their experience.I once encountered a SME company that refused to hire anyone but Malaysian Chinese PRs. Boss was a Malaysian Chinese PR and every single worker was a Malaysian Chinese PR. Because PRs helped to meet the quota, he hired Malaysian Chinese on S-Passes, then they slowly converted to PR.Not even a single citizen in the entire company."
"This is what I wanted to say: the just announced budget did not address EP holders competing with our PMETs for jobs. This is the sector where our middle-class is hurt most. You can see dozens of reports from our ministers talking about our vulnerable PMETs but yet I have not seen anything concrete to address the root of the problems. The PR quota is not affected by but the announced plan to reduce the dependency ratio ceiling (DRC). I am not against skilled foreign talents but you need to level the playing feild; otherwise, who's going to hire more expensive locals when both have the same skilksets?"
"Saying locals won't go for S Pass misunderstands what the S Pass is used for. A lot of entry level and back office jobs that a younger or less educated Singaporean might be qualified to do fall under the S Pass salary range. The WP is typically what's used for very low wage ""dirty"" or manual labour jobs. S Pass is more like low to mid level office jobs."
I am just worried that this forced restructure might not benefit the economy.
"Benefiting the economy and benefiting local citizens are not always the same thing, depending on who you talk to."
Well there is definitely a need to control the number of foreign workers.It has to be a adjustment over time.No one will be able to predict the magical number to control.
So this could even apply to people who have lived and worked in Singapore for many years ?
"As long as those people are S pass holders, yes."
Oh i see.
"I'm glad the PAP is taking a firm stand on this. Cutting the dependency ratio makes sense in the big picture:While they're cutting it, they're supporting the adoption of automated solutions:Singapore is actively expanding the use of technology to plug the chronic talent shortage as Minister Heng also announced the planned extension of the Automation Support Package (ASP) by two years in an effort to help firms deploy robotics and IoT technologies...By supporting automated solutions, they're growing the automated solutions industry.The nascent automated solutions industry could become a growth driver for the country since such solutions are exportable.Essentially, they're replacing blue-collar jobs many Singaporeans aren't willing to do (service jobs) with better-paying white-collar jobs (marketing, engineering, design jobs, etc, at companies producing automated solutions).Here's a great article with examples of automation in the service industry. It touches on the above points.On a personal level, I do feel sorry for foreign workers who will lose their jobs. Hopefully, they've had foresight and been frugal. After all, our government's policy has long been that it doesn't owe citizens a living, much less foreign workers.Edit:Also worth mentioning that it is correct to begin reducing our dependence on unskilled foreign labor now because supply will dwindle as labor sources catch up economically. For example, Chinese metropolises have grown extremely quickly, also, China is facing a low-birth-rate. These factors mean China will likely end up with their own labor shortages, and not export as much labor as they do now."
Erm. It's not PAP. It's the government. They are not the same thing.You could argue that they are the majority party but it's still not the same thing.Operating machines are typically still blue collared jobs.Just because a operating line has more machines doesn't mean the headcount is reduced. It could just mean production goes up.Just because a blue collar worker is displaced by machine doesn't mean he can just hop into a white collar role either.The problem of people working in blue collar jobs is self inflicted in a way.This drive to automation will hurt folks whom do not help themselves. Ie: complain about people or machines stealing their jobs. Not willing to do more learn more.
"Erm. It's not PAP. It's the government. They are not the same thing. You could argue that they are the majority party but it's still not the same thing.You'll have to be clearer. You say ""it is not the same thing"" twice, but don't explain why. Why isn't it fair to assign ownership of this policy to the PAP? After all, it was proposed and created by them, moreover, it will be implemented by them.Operating machines are typically still blue collared jobs.The dependency ratio cuts are for service sector jobs. Examples of automation replacing service sector jobs are things like food delivery robots used by hotels.Sure, you might still need a technician on site, but he replaces several service workers. At the same time, dozens of white-collar jobs are created by the company creating the robot.Just because a operating line has more machines doesn't mean the headcount is reduced. It could just mean production goes up.The point is to reduce marginal manpower required. I.e with automation, a restaurant producing the same amount of food will need fewer service workers.Just because a blue collar worker is displaced by machine doesn't mean he can just hop into a white collar role either. The problem of people working in blue collar jobs is self inflicted in a way. This drive to automation will hurt folks whom do not help themselves. Ie: complain about people or machines stealing their jobs. Not willing to do more learn more.I agree that the transition isn't easy (or always possible). With regard to dependency ratio changes, we're talking about reducing the quota for foreign workers. This means local workers will be in greater demand in the short-term. In turn, this means citizen service workers have more time/resources to adapt. However, like you say, some will never adapt because of their mentalities. That's not the worst thing though, without some selection pressure humanity won't move forward.Edit: grammar"
"The policy is created by government and voted in parliament. PAP is a polictical party. They just happen to be the majority party.Calling PAP the owner of this policy is politically incorrect.E.g.: minister of education executes a policy. Said minister happens to be PAP party. Is this policy from.the ministry or from PAP?Hope this explains.Your point is correct. For many automation, jobs will be displaced.My point is correct that these displaced blue worker will not automatically become white collar.Actually saying local wprkers have more time to adapt may not be right.We are exactly in this problem due to the past where there are not enough workers. Thus the need to open the gates wider for working adults.If we have the luxury of time we will not be in current situation where we have to cut back on the numbers.Same for white collared automation job. Is it easier to hire someone already able to take the job? Or send someone to study a course for 6 months to 3 years to take the job?That's time the companies on the ground do not have."
"The policy is created by government and voted in parliament. PAP is a polictical party. They just happen to be the majority party. Calling PAP the owner of this policy is politically incorrect. E.g.: minister of education executes a policy. Said minister happens to be PAP party. Is this policy from.the ministry or from PAP? Hope this explains.The policy is the PAP's. I'm not sure how you've come to the conclusion that parties don't own their policies? Consider American politics, for example, ""Democratic policies include stricter gun control"". When talking about policies, it is normal to attribute them to their creators.Edit: Here are some examples of articles that attribute policies to parties or even individuals. Out of curiosity, where did you get the notion that policies are only attributable to ""the government""?New leader of Germany’s Christian Democrats signals shift away from Angela Merkel’s liberal migration policyChina paints DPP election rout as rejection of Taiwan independenceActually saying local wprkers have more time to adapt may not be right.By reducing the dependency ratio, local workers will be more in demand. This means citizen jobs that would otherwise have been lost to automation will remain for longer. Also, locals may get better remuneration.You disagree with this assessment, why?We are exactly in this problem due to the past where there are not enough workers. Thus the need to open the gates wider for working adults.What is the ""problem"" you are referring to in this point?If we have the luxury of time we will not be in current situation where we have to cut back on the numbers.Who is ""we"" here? (I'm sorry but I'm finding your thought process hard to follow, also you don't seem to be responding to the points in my previous comment. I suggest using the greater than sign > to quote my points). Anyway, just to be clear:Citizen workers will have more time/resources to upgrade themselves.The country collectively has some time to restructure our work force. We've got several decades, hence the gradual reduction of the dependency ratio.Same for white collared automation job. Is it easier to hire someone already able to take the job? Or send someone to study a course for 6 months to 3 years to take the job? That's time the companies on the ground do not have.It is easier to hire someone ""already able to take the job"". Ask yourself though, how did that person get to the point where he has the requisite skills? He picked up the skills on his own. The onus is on individuals to improve themselves."

"This drive to automation will hurt folks whom do not help themselves. Ie: complain about people or machines stealing their jobs. Not willing to do more learn more.Tbh Singapore companies are also very cheap. Was in a company which just ended up outsourcing everything they can tech support, customer service overseas as its cheaper. Its very weird to me to see singaporeans criticise workers for not willing to do more, plenty actually work double jobs. Noone works ""hard jobs"" like construction cause the pay is generally shit especially when compared to other industries.Willing to do more and learn more is not always the answer when someone else can do it also for cheaper."
"Comapnies are built to turn a profit. If outsourcing is cheaper, why not?It's not companies responsibilities to let locals earn a leaving.Your last point is exactly my thoughts.So my question to you is. how did it came to this?"
Its a natural process. We are not alone in facing this issue. Workers from poorer countries will naturally go to richer countries and will naturally be cheaper. Sure it is not the companies's job. It is however the government's job. Thats why its a hard decision in balancing the quota.The reason i say this is because simply dismissing blue collar workers losing their jobs as them not working or learning hard enough is rediculous.
"Well automation is the way forward.Managing, supporting automation is unlikely to be a blue collar role.If the worker do not work hard to change, whose to bear part of the responsibility?Ps: seems others disagree with you as well seeing the down vote. Wasn't me.I disagree and discuss. I don't down vote and treat it as a magical way to tell you that you are wrong."
"Well automation is the way forward.Sure automation is an option however not all jobs can be automated and not all businesses will be willing to or able afford automation. Its a long-term target.If the worker do not work hard to change, whose to bear part of the responsibility?I have alrd addressed this previously though? It does not matter how hard you change if there is cheaper labor available and in reality singaporeans being in a rich and costly country will naturally cost more. All im saying its rediculous to blame blue collar workers of not working/learning hard enough in them losing their jobs.And yes as stated previously businesses dont care however the government has to care to prevent exploitation of cheap labour.Ps: seems others disagree with you as well seeing the down vote. Wasn't me.I disagree and discuss. I don't down vote and treat it as a magical way to tell you that you are wrong.Sure. I did not bring up the upvote/downvote at all though? Were you replying to someone else?"
"True.Not entirely blame blue workers but have to bear part of the responsibility.The ratio is also trying to solve this issue.And yes i was early in saying companies are built to make profits. Not ensuring that locals have jobs.Thus government also have incentives to hire locals. So apart from adjusting ratio, incentives needs to be looked into as well.Nope. Just pointing out that someone just magically explaining to both of us that we are wrong using the down vote function."
"Erm. It's not PAP. It's the government. They are not the same thing.This being Singapore, I do not really blame laypersons for not understanding the difference between the Party, the State, the Government and the government-of-the-day."
"The PAP is the party in power, they can pass laws because they have a majority in parliament. Therefore any law passed is proposed and supported by the PAP. This is not rocket science.In terms of government policy, this is set by ministers, who are all elected PAP politicians.I'm amazed anyone would claim the civil service or government is somehow making changes to policy that are not directed by the party in power."
"Exactly this. I was pretty surprised when /u/danielling1981 randomly concocted a rule that policies can't be attributed to parties and must only be attributed to ""the government"". Then /u/bonkers05 actually concurred with him. Sigh. Such unhinged opinions used to be rare on reddit or would at least get downvoted."
I am not agreeing with /u/danielling1981. I am just saying that the PAP has over the years been so interwined with the State and the Government that it is often difficult to tell them apart from one another.
"Ah I see. Yeah I agree, they are one and the same to many."
Let's just say that PAP whip is a bias opinion and that the government is fair and unbias.By suggesting that PAP is controlling all the policies just because they are the majority party would then make the government bias and the PAP become a reality.If you get what i mean.If you don't then it's no matter.Thanks for mention so i can explain my thoughts.Ps: seeing that it got up vote more than down vote i guess there are others who think the same or understand.
"Ps: seeing that it got up vote more than down vote i guess there are others who think the same or understand.That's a major reason for my comment:Such unhinged opinions used to be rare on reddit or would at least get downvoted.Seems like the recent spike in users has brought some simpler people to r/singapore. This isn't unexpected. As platforms become popular, simpler people find out about them and the quality of discourse deteriorates.Anyway, I've already proven empirically that it's normal to attribute policies to their creators in this comment.To be 100% clear, in the Independent's piece, they writeThe new leader of Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU) outlined plans on Sunday to change the party's migrant policies...They don't say ""the government's migrant policies"".For extra reference, an article by the CNN writes:the White House recommended the rescission of Obama policy intended to ensure that African-American students are not disproportionately targeted under school discipline rules.They say ""Obama policy"", not ""government policy"" or even ""policy of the Obama government"". Why? Because it was Obama's policy. Just as the ratio reduction is the PAP's policy.I know you have some issues with comprehension, so I'll boil it down to a simple question: does /u/danielling1981 think he knows better than the Independent, the CNN and the Straits Times?For the record, your argument:Let's just say that PAP whip is a bias opinion and that the government is fair and unbias.By suggesting that PAP is controlling all the policies just because they are the majority party would then make the government bias and the PAP become a reality.Makes so little sense I can't even be bothered to rebut it. You do realize the PAP whip is a person right? How can a person be an opinion? Hahaha. That's unhinged dude. Free tip: it would make no sense for you to say ""Hi I'm Daniel Ling, I'm an opinion""."
"I guess it can't be helped that there are more simple people like me in reddit.Could you assist to point out where in the post that attribute credit to PAP? I must have miss it.For the germany piece.Changing the party policy would be different from the country / government policy isn't it?I get what you mean. Yes they may credit q policy to someone or party. But in the end, the party is voted in and executed by the Government. In SG context, by the parliament. Subsequently executed By relevant ministry.Of course i don't know better than MSM or even alternative.I don't know how to argue with you on the last point since you didn't get it. So i won't elaborate further.You can take it that i lost and unable to debate further since I'm one of the simple folks here.I leave it up to you not as simple or advance folks."
Let's just say that PAP whip is a bias opinion and that the government is fair and unbias.By suggesting that PAP is controlling all the policies just because they are the majority party would then make the government bias and the PAP become a reality.If you get what i mean.If you don't then it's no matter.

"I've been here for 2 weeks now and my skin has tiny little bumps. It's not really dry or oily, pretty normal, but it just doesn't look the best. I'm using sunscreen every day but perhaps its not strong enough. What do you guys do to keep your skin looking like a baby's bottom? More water? Some special product? Clueless angmoh over n out"
"Be it moisturisers, toners, or cleansing products, choose water based products instead of oil/cream based. The format is also very important, I prefer water/gel based products over cream or oil based products that are too thick in this humid weather and can cause break outs and milia seeds (tiny bumps). Generally Korean Brands offer more water based products. Also choose alcohol free toners as I find toners that have alcohol content break my skin out in the humid weather"
"this was really useful, thank you!! I use a Korean brand face moisturizer with chia seed and I think its water based, but for stuff like sunscreen and base I think that might be causing the gross skin tbh"
"Just a few other pointers that might possibly help you, based on my personal experience. Avoid washing your face more than twice in a day. I know how humid the weather is, and some times your skin might secrete excess oil in the middle of the day and you feel a need to cleanse to get rid of the mid day glow and greasy feeling. Over cleansing can strip your skin of its natural oils and cause it to over produce sebum to compensate for that, resulting in clogged pores and milia seeds. What I find useful is using a thermal spring water spray in mid day as a refresher to keep my face feeling dewy and fresh. Thermal spring water can help to calm your skin and make it feel less oily and sticky. I personally recommend Avene’s thermal spring water, though I’ve heard that La Roche Posay’s one is good as well! As for cosmetics, avoid powder products such as powder foundation and loose setting powders as the humidity will react badly with the powder to clog your pores. If you are applying makeup, make sure you prime your face with a good primer and opt for liquid foundation/bb cream instead. Hope your skin condition improves, and welcome to hot and humid Singapore!!"
I’ve been reading a lot about thermal water recently and I have to ask. Do you use it as a cleanser or toner or?
"No it does not replace your cleanser nor toner. It has a myriad of purposes that you can use it for. For me, I use it in the mid day as a refresher when my skin is feeling oily, I also use it to soothe my skin when I get irritations as I have very sensitive skin. You can also use it as a setting spray after you apply your make up base to even out and remove excess foundation. I’m a huge fan of its soothing properties, as it truly calms my skin down when it is red from irritation. My preferred brand is Avene, but I’ve heard good reviews on La Roche Posay as well. I’ve tried the Vichy one and it doesn’t seem to have the effect that Avene has on my skin"
"Amazing, thanks for all the useful info!!!"
"Go light on the makeup too until your skin adjusts. Sunscreen, use a quick absorbing one like supergoopi or those water / gel based Japanese sunscreens you can get at any drugstore. Blot dry your face throughout the day if you’re sweating a bunch."
How do you get rid of milia seeds btw?
"You just have to take care of your skin and they will eventually subside! Do not ever try to squeeze milia seeds as they are not white heads or black heads, meaning to say there is no pus underneath the skin layer and you should never attempt to break the skin."
"Try acid. With ingredients like either Aha or Bha to add into your routine. Keep up with the sun cream, but also make sure to remove it entirely before bedtime."
Try acid.CNB would like to have a word with you.../S
"Tried acid, now I'm the skin of my soul"
"Feels like the sunscreen may be clogging up your face. Perhaps you could try cutting it out of your routine for a week or so and see if it improves. Wear a cap, shade, use a good umbrella, etc. when you're out in the sun to protect your skin in the meantime and try to keep to the shaded areas."
That happened to me too. Your skin is your adjusting to the constant humidity I think. In a few months you will have the softest skin you've ever had.
this gives me hope !!
"The humidity doesn't dry your skin out as much as your angmo country (I'm making an assumption on where you come from) does. The heat just makes you sweat.Slapping on sunscreen just helps to trap the oils, sweat and dust on your skin and pores. BANG. Shit skin.Most of us have shit skin too. Most guys here are scammed by girls' make up.PS: my comment is shit."
True I also have shitty pores as well. And I have breakouts ranging from area to area. So I used innisfree trouble care line along with moisturizing. I suggest you need to take care of pores first. I also have bumps as well and when I squeeze them translucent ‘seasame seeds ‘ come out. You just need to keep your pores clean and moisturized. Try innisfree volcanic clay line
ew wtf sesame seeds
They honestly look like translucent sesame. I can take a pic of them. They are actually sebum in the pores. I also call them heads like whiteheads and blackheads. Both of these are caused by oil clogged in pores
I think they're called the Sebaceous glands.
Ah yes that
Guy here. Dont touch your face except when you are washing it.
"I wear sunscreen religiously. Make sure it is properly removed every night. Because it’s serious stuff, it might help to use an oil cleanser or balm (eg Banilaco’s Clean It Zero). A light foam cleanser might not be sufficient to remove it completely.If you’re from a more temperate clime, your moisturiser might be too rich. Try hydrating toners. You could decant them into a spray bottle — feels really refreshing."
"Yep same thing happened to me at first...and every time I come back after being away in temperate climates. To get over the hump, drink lots of water, be mindful of your sugar/alcohol/dairy intake, and go easy on facial products. Everyone had a miracle product to recommend me but what sorted me was a less is more approach, eating better and then taking the time to find a sunscreen that worked for my skin in Singapore, (this ended up surprisingly being Kiehl’s for me). Your skin will be so soft and fab soon!"
Complete opposite for me. I am fine here but when I go overseas especially colder climates by skin becomes super dry and get occasional rashes due to the different bacteria in the air/water.
Same. My skin starts to flake over there.I have sweaty palms and my palm skin somehow starts to flake. That's defeating the law of nature.
Its the humidity.
"I’m Canadian Born Chinese and travel to Asia quite often. Especially in the SEA regions, you will be prone to heat rash. Feel free to Google the cause and how to remedy. In essence, though, you’ll need stay in a cool and dry climate for a few days. Ice baths/showers will also work."
"Relatable. Whenever i spend a while in temperate climates my skin gets worse after i return to singapore. It sucks. I think my skin gets really dry in winter and steps up oil production, but when i return to humid-island it doesnt stop oil production. I honestly dont really know what to do about it. If you find out please shareHave you always worn this brand of sunblock even before coming here? If not, the bumps could be due to the sunblock clogging your pores."
Hmm... actually folks in singapore don’t rly use sunscreen that much. At least that’s the case for guys. Maybe u can try dropping it?
"Sunscreen is important, especially given our climate! Most of my female friends in SG use sunscreen anyway."
"I'm a girl with very fair light skin and I burn easily, so unfortunately I have to wear sunscreen every day :P"
"I suspect that it’s fungal acne. Causes are moving from a dry climate to a humid climate, disrupting yeast balance on your skin thus forming colourless tiny bumps that look like pimples but are not and have no pus. (often misdiagnosed as acne.) it can be identified by its itchiness too.It can be eliminated by applying anti fungal shampoo called nizoral on your face as a mask for 5 minutes for 2 weeks."
Tretinoin is your best option. See a GP or derm to get it. Azelaic acid or Vitamin C serums are good alternatives too.

"I've gotten legit calls from banks in the past:Hi, i am XXX from Bank PPP, i am calling back with regards to your enquiry. Before we proceed can i verify your (choose mom's maiden name, NRIC or other bank accounts with us).I am always so tempted for them to authenticate with me that they are indeed from Bank PPP. Why must I trust you if u are the one calling me instead of the other way round ?"
"It doesn't even have to pretend to be from a bank. One of my friends got this call from someone who told her she had won a contest. Reads out her details, asks her to authenticate. Then says ""I'm gonna send you a code to verify your phone number."" Sends her an OTP. She wisely smells a rat and asks what is it for, a lot of questions, caller hangs up. Lucky her."
"If you're ever unsure about the origin of a call, then hang up immediately. These scammers are getting more and more brazen and using sophisticated methods these days. Some will even claim to be old classmates or long-lost relatives when calling. For instance my friend was scammed by someone who claimed to be a missionary who was stuck in China and needed money to get out. Somehow they were able to find that my friend is a fairly serious Christian and used it to take advantage.That said, I'm surprised that people still fall for the obvious ones... like the ""African Prince Scam"" or the ""Secret Lover Scam"" (run by Nigerians in Malaysia)."

Im looking to have a small tattoo done. Thanks in advance!
"Her style is not for watercolour tattoos, but her technique suits small ones. Check @fleecircus on Instagram."
I got my tattoo from her. She's professional and talented. You won't go wrong choosing her as your artist.
Could you please share your experience? I really like her work but there are a couple of negative reviews on Google so I'm a little discouraged.
"I first had to make an appointment, firstly to discuss about your art work. She would want to find out the reason of your design, if she can help to improve on it, etc.Once done, you then pay a deposit, and book the tattoo appointment.Nearer to the appointment date, she will then send u an email with her sketch and you can inform her on what to edit. The communication towards your tatoo is important as it's permanent and she just wants the best for her client. You can really feel her passion and concern for client.That's all for the admin part.I won't go though much of the tattooing experience as everyone feels differently but she tries her very best to make it as painless as possible. For me it was meditative and I loved the final design on my body."

"As many of you know, today is the release of A level results, and my sister just got home with the following resultsA for H2 MathC for H2 PhysicsA for H2 ChemC for H1 EconsD for H1 GPA for H1 Project WorkRank points of 78.75/90I myself come from a integrated programme without having to take A levels so I'm like totally clueless when it comes to the results and rank points. So I'll really appreciate it if you guys would be able to provide any insights! She is looking to get into NUS Faculty of Science looking to go into Chemistry courses. Many thanks!"
IP no need to take A levels...?
Think he meant IB
Or NUS high
"Hi ! I’m currently studying in NUS and there’s only two chemistry related majors, one being a major in Chemistry and the other being Food Science and Technology (FST). With her grades, it shouldn’t be hard for her to enter NUS Chemistry (I believe the cut off is ABB last year). However do note that the difference in difficulty is huge and with her D in GP, she will also need to take QET, which is basically an English examination. Feel free to ask me if she has any queries!"
"Thanks for your advice! She really appreciates it, ah yes I heard about the QET. After hearing all these she is definitely more encouraged to try for NUS!"
reality hit me hard when i realised that chemistry seems to have little majorsor is there different courses given by each uni? sorry i am clueless in a levels
/r/sgexams
Thanks!
"NUS awards an extra 1.25 points for the first-choice courses, i.e. your sister's score for 80 points for her application to NUS Chem"
You what kind of IP no need take A level one LOLS
Either NUSH or IB
"First thing to look at would be 10th percentile IGPs, thats like the basic normal way to enter any course. If anything else would be under some sort of achievement admission so cca, projects, school stuff n all that extra stuff. iirc sciences arent the most competitive in terms of grades so those grade shld be right about there. any other queries u shld rly check the websites out or go to the upcoming open housesNTUNUS"
"I got into NUS Chemistry (Enrolled in 2008, results in 2006) with A (Chem), B (Math), C (E Lit), C6 (GP), 1 (PW). So I would say should be no problem getting in.Anw there are 3+1 Chem majors: (Pure) Chem, Applied Chem and FST. Some people also like to lump in Chem Engin, but that is mostly engineering and little chemistry."
"For the past month or so, I keep getting calls from random sg registered numbers. Both mobile (start with a 9) and like landline (start with a 6) numbers. Any time I answer, no one responds and when I try to call back the line gets cut off. I’ve learnt my lesson to not even pick up any numbers I do not recognise and I’ve been diligently blocking them.It’s so irritating and I worry that I may miss an important call one day like for a job interview or some doctor’s appointment I may have just because I’m done with answering unknown empty phone calls.I’ve tried googling these numbers and no luck relating them to a person or a company. Please help!!Does anyone else experience this or know what to do going forward??"
"I've also been getting these calls daily for the past few months and it was a nightmare because I was expecting calls and most of the time the calls were from them. It's a different number every single time.Sometimes when I answer there will be an ang mo greeting me and telling me that they are from Smart Financial but I just hang up straight away. Sometimes when I answer the call, it just hangs up by itself after 3-5 seconds.I got a feeling that they are using other people's number to cover up their own numbers? There was once I tried to call back and an auntie answered and said that she didn't call me. There were some numbers that I wasn't able to call back though.It got so annoying because I can't block them and they call me 2-3 times a day so I just changed my number.I found this thread from hwz though."
"That’s exactly it, the whole hanging up after 3-5 secs and it being a different number every time. So far no one calling me from ‘Smart Financial’ and hopefully it stays that way.How are they even getting our numbers?? Idw to change my number if they’re eventually gonna weasel their way back. Like what do these people expect from us with their incessant calling??"
I'm not too sure on how they got my number but maybe I wasn't careful enough on who I was handing out my number to. I don't personally know anyone else that's affected by it though so I'm just hoping they don't get to my new number.
"I experienced the same thing (caller identifying themselves to be from Smart Financial, using different numbers, hangs up by itself when picked up)Except I also received calls from abroad that gave the same situations as above. Numbers are from UK, Australia, London. The ones from local numbers are recent.I read these numbers are spoofed (anyway I dunno what is this spoofing about , I'm copy-pasting what I read). By doing what they did, it's killing their reputation already. So un-smart."
Save the numbers on your phone. The scammers won't use the same numbers more than once. Your doctor or interviewers will call back
Is there a way to report these numbers?? Or find out its source??
Report? Unlikely. Find out? Hmm call using a different line and see who picks up. Or Google the number
"I’ve tried calling with my house phone and it’s the same, no one answers.But thanks for the suggestions."
Add another layer of blocking: Register your number with https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Individuals/Do-Not-Call-Registry-and-You/Registering-with-the-Do-Not-Call-RegistryTry not to use the number on contests and lucky draws
"If the calls are already made illegally/spam, the registry doesn't really make a difference."
That is why I said “add”.No one can guarantee anything
"Thanks, registered!!Feels like I’m being pranked called every day."
Possible if you are in WhatsApp groups etc. Hence I tend to be very careful which groups to join
true. Friends and I tried to raid and Desi Auntie Sex Chat (Weirdly enough it was super active wtf) and instead WE got raided with calls from India + Middle East countries and lovely dick pics/vagina pics.
Hey off topic but any chance youre a Beatles fan? saw ur username :)
Hahah yes. A huge one.
Yes! I'm not sure but it only started happening frequently recently.
"Yea I've been receiving these annoying calls (mostly from local SG mobile numbers) lately too. When I answer them, there would be silence. From then on, as long as it's not a contact in my contact book, I will not pick it up.I've tried a couple of times to add the numbers on whatsapp so that I can view their profile pictures/details (genius right? Hehe). And they are people whom I've never seen or know before."
"To kick things off, I’m 23m and currently working for an uncle of mine and his own company. Company is not really HUGE but able to make a comfortable living for now, with no other additional expenses like housing and kids. I dropped out of private diploma back in 2015 and went on to enlist on the same year October. ORD-ed in 2017 October and started working for my Uncle. My N level result was 18, barely made it to Os ( I know I could’ve gotten into higher nitec but stupid me chose Os because of some personal reasons ). My Os result was atrocious I don’t even want to mention it, thus the private diploma. Study isn’t really my thing as I proceeded to drop out of it as per above.Now I’m almost 2 years into working for my uncle and I’ve been asked A LOT about my education. Told them what I said above and 90% of them told, encouraged me to continue studying, if not I’ll regret. I’m really at a loss now as I’m really really not built for studying and I’m afraid if I don’t, in the future i will get into a huge trouble of financial difficulties and jobless state if touchwood this current business fails. (Im planning to take over my Uncle as the director when he retires).So, do I risk myself dropping out again and wasting my money and time, or do I work hard to strive in this business?TLDR: Sucked at exam, dropped out, working at uncle’s business and don’t know to go back to study or not.Edit 1: please feel free to advice on how or what I should do, I will take all of the advice to heart, thank you!"
Don't overload yourself and don't worry about timetables. It sounds like you want to do it but are apprehensive to try again. Just take one class at first and see how you do. The point is to keep moving towards the goal one step at a time.
One class at first? What do you mean?
"I'm sure everyone gave you plenty of good advice, but here is my take:You sound really apprehensive to the idea of studying, which I very well understand. Not everyone is good at studying and you should never feel bad for being bad at doing some dumb homework.But here's what I would do if I was in your shoes:I would focus on the business entirely and forget about the degree. The only classes I would take is only classes that will enrich my knowledge with regards to the business itself e.g if its food business, more cooking classes, if it's machinery, more coding/safety courses w/e.Degrees are only really a safety net just in case touchwood your business fails and winds up and you need to rejoin the workforce and work under someone, then you have at least a degree to fall back on. If not, I'll put all my chips into the business, which definitely would encourage me to bring the business to the next level as the next director and just keep focusing on the job and don't think about anything else.Not all degree holders are successful and not all successful people are degree holders. Don't feel down because of a stupid paper that people pay to get, I believe in you :)"
"If you're in a position to be in management (or going to become one), 70-80% of business school content can be learnt online. The rest that can't would be practice with projects, presentations, discussions etc. There's a lot of value out there on the Internet if you're determined enough. You could very well create your own learning curriculum. If you become good at managing people and the business, nobody will care where you come from."
"Imho taking a diploma is really close to taking a short course, depending on your interest. Of course a diploma is worth more than a regular cert that's why people will encourage you to further study. I was 24 and older colleagues also say the usual ""You are still young, do it"". End of the day do you have any interest aside from working blindly for money/your uncle's. If there is go for courses/diploma.Just like you and many others I worried about ""wasting"" money on studying something only to get nowhere after (I'm kinda in that spot right now). But do I regret dropping my job for studying my interest, saying ""No"" will be lying but deep down I'm fine with it. Money can be earned back slowly anyways. If your uncle is fine with it you can still return to his place after studying and you will at least have a diploma for future.Tl;dr : if not studying material, find your interest first. Picking up a skill and memorizing stuff aka studying is different"

"I’d advise you to study something that would help you in your current role ie; finance, accounting or management. This will give you something to fall back on if things don’t work out in your current role.I hate to be a wet blanket but there are no guarantees you’ll be taking over the business even if it’s successful."
"Focus on the business. This means upgrading your skills every now and then to make sure that you stay relevant in the field (this can be anything from Microsoft Excel to Business Management 101). There are lots of skillsfuture courses you can take, if not, go for something online on Coursera or Udemy. Save money. Lots of it. If the business tanks, you can just enrol into a school and get that degree with the money you've saved."
"There are degree programs you can take with an O level cert, do check them out if you feel like a diploma isn’t what you want"
"If you wish to succeed in your career, then instead of going for diploma / degree, take up courses related to your work. Even if you take a private diploma, it will end up being just a piece of paper, everyone on the streets are a diploma/degree holder.More importantly is you must learn to adapt and innovate, like always strive to improve and change, the market changes every minute. As a business owner, you must learn to adapt to changes and prepare for the future."
"Since you plan to take over your uncle's business, you should either learn on the job or study something that will be helpful to the business."
"Perhaps you can think about what you’d like to do in the future. Would you enjoy working in your uncle’s business until you grow old, or is there something else you’d like to try out as a career? My suggestion is to not study for the sake of getting some random degree, but study because it would help you get into a career path that you want. If the future life you envision for yourself doesnt need you to continue studying, then don’t do it. No need to conform to what society views as the norm when it comes to education, just work hard for what you yourself want, and do good by your own eyes. Anyway, if you decide that you want to change career path in the future, you can always go back to school again. I myself have uni classmates in their 30s who worked for about a decade before going back to school!! So dont worry about it if you dont feel like studying now. All the best bro."
"Not everyone is academically driven. No two people are the same. I can’t tell you to study because if you have no interest in the subject there’s a chance you won’t do well and that will lead you to waste time and money. You have to ask yourself the question, can I give my all and put in the effort and energy to my studies? If you can’t or aren’t able to, then don’t. There are other ways to success but hard work is the common denominator."
"Or you could be one of the pioneering trailblazers in Singapore, work hard, succeed, and help to demonstrate that paper qualifications don't really mean much (I believe they do not).For me getting good exam results and paper qualifications just tell me that you're an obedient conformist who had the discipline to sit still for many hours, whether in class or in front of your desk doing Ten Year Series questions. You will thus make a good foot soldier. Paper qualifications don't tell me about the many other attributes that will help you succeed in your professional career."
"Saying that is easy. Unless you are setting up your own business companies do look at your ""paper"". Now for op he has to decide what else he wants to be. Continuing and taking over his relative's business is totally fine but without having any personal goals that will just be similar to being an ""obedient conformist"" to life."
"lolz, this story doesn't mean tt dudethis story means you need a rich uncle to start with"
"Well OK. He was lucky to have an uncle who roped him in. But sustaining success will require more than just luck. If he's incompetent, the business will fail or his uncle will not trust him."
"I’m absolutely with you on the incompetent part. Let me get this straight out, I’m aware that I’m not stupid, but I’m not a high caliber smart person, most of my friends are of, if not smarter than me in one way or another. But yes, you’re correct."
a small million dollar loan.
And not lose it all in a failed business. Lol
"Everybody starts at foot soldier level anyway.Are you going to groom a fresh hire for a C level position without ascertaining if he even has basic qualities for the job such as the responsibility and discipline to meet deadlines and sufficient analytical skills?There are not many ways a young person can demonstrate such qualities besides job experience and academic performance.Between a candidate with excellent academic grades and one with mediocre/crappy ones, I'll pick the one with excellent grades every time unless the one one with mediocre grades has an incredible resume.Sure you get poor candidates with good grades once in a while but overall it's far less risky than taking a chance on an unproven hire"
"I’ve heard alot people saying this but the sad truth is, there ARE a lot of people (Bosses) who looks at qualification as the LEAST standard or threshold in order them to hire a person. I am risking of being successful in this job, or being totally jobless in a future where qualifications are looked highly upon and in an rapidly advanced technological society. Thank you for your advice!"
they want you to get out so yr uncle will promote them in the future
"Nope they are in a different picture, none of them are related and promotion is not a thing to worry about here! It’s complicated."
"In this case the only advice i can give u is ironically, not to care too much about advice from people. You do you.Seriously though, people tell you to go do a diploma/degree because it worked for them, and because that’s what everyone does in Singapore. However not everyone has to take the O levels>JC/Poly>Uni>Job path, not all careers are equal and there are plenty of people out there who do quite well with just O levels>Job.Also, studying as an adult is a huge time/energy/financial commitment, and the piece of paper that you get at the end may not necessarily even give you good ROI. Only do it if it’s part of your long term career plan, and not for the paper hunt."
"Long term career planYes, the reason why I’m contemplating is because like is said, IF the business were to fail, I risk going out to the working world with only my atrocious Os result which nobody will bat an eye on.And I did. I did ignore the advices with a smile and nod but in the span of these 2 years, increasing number of people telling me the same thing of continuing my studies made me doubt myself.."
not all careers are equal and there are plenty of people out there who do quite well with just O levels>Job.And plenty of people don't.
And plenty the vast majority of people don't.FTFY
"I have been working in my current job for close to 22 months and I would like to move on. I went for a first-round interview a couple of weeks ago and I have been called up for a second-round interview. I feel that I have a relatively high chance of getting this job.I am aware that a job offer is usually offered to the candidate with little time to “think about it”, so I would like to be prepared for that eventuality. I hope to seek advice from fellow redditors out here with regards to accepting of a job offer and resignation from current job.The moment after you receive a job offer and assuming that the company only gives you 1 or 2 days to consider:Should I accept the job offer first and tender my resignation later? Or should I tender resignation first then accept the job offer?What should I tell my current boss? Do I have to give a reason for my resignation?Is it safe to negotiate date of start work? E.g notice period is 1 month but I would like to start another 2 weeks later as I wish to go overseas for a short break. Meaning instead of 4 weeks before I start work, I will take 6 weeks.If you have any other advice other than the above, I would really appreciate it too! Thanks. :)"
"Assuming the job offer is 100% okay with you, accept it and resign the same day effectively starting your notice period.Print out a formal resignation letter dated and signed by you. In the resignation letter, note these 3 things: a) that you're leaving, b) when your last day is, and c) any niceties and words of gratitude (if this applies to you). If asked, I'd let them know that you have accepted a job offer and that you're not at liberty to discuss anything about the new job. Keep it short and simple. After the meeting, send your boss an email with the afore-mentioned letter so that he/she cannot say that they didn't receive it. Ask for an acknowledgment on the email.In my experience, it is, but you should talk to the hiring manager or your future boss about these things before accepting any job offer. If they're pretty chill/casual, just say that the short break was planned beforehand. If not, just say that you need it to start in 6 weeks instead of 4 weeks."
"Thanks a lot for the detailed info! It really helps. One more question though, I still have a total of 12.5 days of leave rolled over from last year, excluding any prorated leave from this year up to the point I resign.That means if I consume all my leave before leaving, I would be taking 3 weeks of leave (out of a 4-week notice period). Is this ethical? Or should I request for encashment of some of my leave?"
"I don't see why it's not ethical, though depending on your work, your boss might prefer that you are actually at work during the notice period to do a handover and help the incoming replacement with any transition. Highly recommend that you speak to your boss/HR exec about how the leave will be consumed, and ""what would be best for the company"" and negotiate from there -- I think it's more tactful and will not risk burning any bridges either."
I had a lot of things to handover so I didn't manage to clear my leave thus it was encashed when I left.
"That means if I consume all my leave before leaving, I would be taking 3 weeks of leave (out of a 4-week notice period). Is this ethical? Or should I request for encashment of some of my leave?1: Take leave during notice period-> Still one month notice, just that you are not at work for 12.5 days2: Encash leave->Exactly what it says, you get extra money, but you serve the full month3: Use the leave to shorten notice period-> Bring forward the last day of work, pay for that month pro-rated.Please read this from MOM regarding notice period"
"I would be taking 3 weeks of leave (out of a 4-week notice period). Is this ethical? Or should I request for encashment of some of my leave?No not unethical at all. For many companies its common practice that they deduct your notice period with your remaining leave and don't even encash unless your leave is beyond the notice period, it will be pro rated. Once you hand in your resignation, HR will just auto deduct and let you know how long you need to serve. OR unless your direct supervisor requires you to serve longer for proper handover. This will be told to HR and remaining leave encashed.All the previous companies I worked at did this. For my previous job I left serving just 4 days notice period."
"Never ever resign before you get the offer letter. Accept the offer first and only resign once you have handed in your new contract and finalised your start date with the new company.Usually you verbally tell your boss that you have resigned, and you can choose to hand a physical letter to them or send a follow up resignation email. Keep it short, just say that you enjoyed working here but you have accepted an offer elsewhere. Don't burn your bridges, be friendly and polite. HR will usually have an exit interview with you in which they will arrange the last working day. You can negotiate encashment of your leave then.It's normal to negotiate the start of your working date, especially if you have a planned holiday. Most companies are quite flexible on this.TBH most bosses are pretty sharp. There's a pattern to people resigning. A succession of half day or one day leave in two-three weeks, followed by a request for a one-on-one meeting (usually with a slightly nervous expression)"
"No. You are not obligated to give a reason for your resignation. When I resigned, my resignation letter was very generic.Eg: Dear Mr/Ms ____, Please accept this as my formal notice of resignation from XYZ Pte Ltd. My last day will be on XX 2019. I am truly grateful for being given the opportunity to be part of XYZ Pte Ltd and I thank you for your guidance over the past year."
"Do not resign until you have accepted the offer and have a signed contract in your hand. If you're a foreigner, you have to take one more step by waiting until you work permit has been successfully transferred/confirmed to the new employer.You don't need to tell them anything actually, or you can just say that you got a better opportunity elsewhere. Unless you plan on using this offer to renegotiate your current job.Can be negotiated, but don't mention any of it until you have accepted the offer and have a signed contract in your hand."
Isnt the starting date usually on the employment contract? Might have to let them know beforehand (after they offer you) before they come out with the contract.
"The best would be to accept the job offer, negotiate joining date, then sign the offer letter of acceptance. Then it will be in black and white.Only after signing do u hand in your resignation letter. Remember to state the last day of working in the resignation letter.As for annual leave balance, it depends on your company policy. Some companies do not allow you to use it during notice period and will encash it. Again, it’s up for negotiation with your boss/hr."
"Oh, do not stay at your current job if they offer to match the pay at your new company. It means your current company has been short-changing you."
"Just out of curiosity, are you a manager?"
I'm not. That happened to my wife.
"I am aware that a job offer is usually offered to the candidate with little time to “think about it”, so I would like to be prepared for that eventualityit depends on your field and ability.if it’s something that requires specialised skills and an involved hiring process, they will not drop the offer just because you want more time to think about it.recruiters’ fees are not cheap, and neither is preparing and conducting interviews. if you are the 1 in 20, they will be willing to wait (this applies to pre-work breaks too)I applied for my current job in August, but I negotiated to start in December because I wanted to do a short-term contract first.conversely, if you know that they are looking at many candidates and will be happy with most of them...then you don’t have much choice."
"I see. Thanks for the info! I will most probably negotiate the start work date with them if I get the job offer. I mean, no harm trying right? If they die die want me to start within a month’s notice period, then I will do so."
"yeah, if a company rescinds an offer just because you began negotiating, that is ultra dodgy and you do not want to work for them."
"Personally, hate it when people state when their last day is in the resignation letter. Most of the time, they have calculated wrongly and I think it's just respectful to discuss with your manager on the last day of service.As for the start date of the new job, definitely ok to negotiate or discuss, in case there's a new project starting, or the current person in your new position, whom you could possibly learn a lot from who will not be there when you arrive.One possibility would be to discuss if it's better for the new company to have you start later or have you take a 1-2 week break after your probation ends."
"LOL 550 a month. Wouldn't it be better to take public transport in that case, the kid probably has to wake up at 5am though. Money or time choose one.To think lastime my school bus was like 40 bucks a month. I remember my school had a tonne of different buses though, was only later they started switching to bus operators. Probably monopolising everything"
"The kid probably has to wake up at 5 am even if it is the school bus. At $550, the journey is probably long and with multiple stops, plus the school bus wants to drop off all the kids early so that it can do another run for office workers. Public transport is often faster than school bus, but the problem is that if the kid is young, an adult has to go along, so it's wasting an adult's time as well as a kid's time."
"Yeah. But it is SCGS. Kiasu parents die die want to send their kids to elite schools.Is the trade-off worth it? For 1+ hour journey, the kid could have better sleep/rest or learning."
All schools are good schools; some schools do better than others.
"from my own experience, how good the school's reputation is is not the main factor. imo, it's always the teachers. you get a good teacher, your grades can jump from fail to an A and vice versa.schools with a better reputation might have better teachers but that might not always be the caseedit: spelling"
"Think you are conflating good schools with reputable schools, though that is common in Singapore."
Why does an adult have to accompany a child on public transport? I was taking public buses home from school by Primary 2.
yea i started in k3 too
Just don't have Children. Problem solved.
People thought you were being serious lol
Not with that attitude
That's more expensive than taking taxis and PHVs.
Agreed.
"When her second child entered Primary 1 this year, Ms Sandy Kang, 40, decided it was time to take her nine-year-old son out of the school-bus system.Although their home in Hougang is just over 2km from Holy Innocents' Primary, where the children are enrolled, the monthly fee charged by the private school-bus services provider is $145 for a one-way trip, for each child.""The amount doubles with my daughter entering Primary 1 this year, which is hefty, considering we live just three bus stops away,"" said Ms Kang, who works in the medical industry as a customer engagement manager.Since the beginning of the year, her husband has been driving the children to school. The maid then takes them home later in the day using public transport.The issue has been a sticking point for parents, especially when such service providers significantly raise rates.Last December, Revolving Transport - a bus operator newly engaged by Singapore Chinese Girls' School (SCGS) to ferry its pupils to and from school - quoted $550 a month for its two-way transport service.It was almost double what the previous bus contractor charged, and hit those living far from the school in Dunearn Road - such as in Punggol, Yishun, Sengkang and Bedok - the hardest.Revolving Transport reduced its rates only when the school intervened. Those living in Punggol now pay $350 a month, with SCGS also providing subsidies of up to $75 for those most affected by the fare hikes.On average, monthly rates charged by private school-bus operators start at $105 for a one-way service, and $126 for the two-way option. But these cover only a 2km radius from the school.📷REGULATE BUS FARESThose who live the furthest away from school are the ones who need the school bus the most. To ensure that they are not overcharged, bus fares must be regulated.HOUSEWIFE HONEY TAN, 47MANY SMALL OPERATORSUnlike public transport where a few big operators run sizeable bundles of heavy and sparse routes, the school-bus industry comprises numerous small, private operators.MRS CHOO LEE SEE, the Education Ministry's divisional director for infrastructure and facilities services, on the ministry not interfering with bus fares as regulation would dissuade private bus operators from offering their services.This is based on self-reported figures of 127 primary schools found on their websites and on the Ministry of Education's (MOE) information notice board for school-bus services.It will cost a family at least $945 a year for the one-way arrangement and at least $1,134 for the two-way deal. School-bus firms require families to pay for a 12-month service even though school terms last nine months.However, the cost also increases according to the distance travelled and bus type. A route with lower demand can result in an additional $15 one way for a 15-to 30-seater bus, or $27 for a bus with fewer than 15 seats. And every additional kilometre covered requires a top-up of $18 for a one-way trip.So pupils who are picked up within 2km of the school, on a bus with fewer than 15 seats, will pay $130 a month on average over nine months, or $1,170 a year for a nine-month term.But parents say it is not just about the rates.They say private school-bus operators have rejected bookings outside of their coverage areas and many schools also appoint only one bus operator, for ease of administration.This means only the appointed bus operator can enter the school while the others have to secure permission.Housewife Honey Tan, 47, said: ""Those who live the furthest away from school are the ones who need the school bus the most. To ensure that they are not overcharged, bus fares must be regulated.""📷 Related StoryParents see red as operator of school bus quotes monthly charge of up to $550Related StorySchool bus fees: Are you paying more than other parents?Parents argue that regulated fares would ensure a high take-up rate for the school bus, which will, in turn, generate more economies of scale and cheaper fares.However, MOE said it will not interfere with bus fares, as regulation would dissuade private bus operators from offering their services.""Unlike public transport where a few big operators run sizeable bundles of heavy and sparse routes, the school-bus industry comprises numerous small, private operators,"" said Mrs Choo Lee See, MOE's divisional director for infrastructure and facilities services.School-bus operators determine fares based on several operating considerations, such as distance of routes, capacity of buses and the number of pupils on that route, she said.""Hence, the cost of serving a few students staying a distance away from the school can be quite high on a per student basis, which then translates into higher fares."""
omg that school! my nephew goes there
Alternative: Carpooling with a friend's parent who is driving
My kid will take public transport. Every morning I see this kid taking public transport with me when I go to work. :0
Ongoing for decades but no influence from parent groups on the bus operators.

GrabShuttle will be cheaper lo!
That's $27.50 assuming 20 days a month.That means $13.75 a trip?Would it be more worthwhile to take a taxi instead if the school is nearby?
I've a kid and I would teach them how to take public transport and road safety. I don't want my kid to be so useless. But that's just me.
Dunno why you’ve downvoted. I think it’s good to learn. Really need to emphasise on being careful on the road though
"Nowadays some children and people can't even do simple things.My mom works as a cleaner in school and told me that students no longer clean their classrooms. I was like shocked. Something as simple as that those kids also can't do.Recently, some of my neighbours got excited about construction on the road, thinking that maybe LTA is going to build a traffic light there. The thing is there are already two traffic lights on the left and right. People can already cross using those traffic lights, or just cross the street between the two traffic lights. First thing that comes to my mind is ""Those neighbours don't even have the patience to cross the road without killing themselves?"""
"Wow wut. I remember cleaning back then too. I’ve seen in japan n Korea the kids travel to school, serve each other n clean up in school. I hope they’re doing that at home in the very least ._."
Maybe school buses should be owned and operated by the school instead of private companies?
Fleet management will be a bitch and that makes the school fully liable should anything happen.

Innovative in ways to grab your money
Well that’s the point of all for profit businesses isn’t it?
"Yeah, but don't do a bait and switch on your customers when you become a monopoly. Shows how little you value your customers and treating them like idiots"
Well a lot of people still do like them a lot
What idea did they actually innovate and not copy from Uber and Gojek?
I'd argue that GO-JEK is more innovative as far as offerings go. But Grab has more impact on a lot more people (this is one of the main criteria).
"Integrated all the different apps in one, so it saves the user a few taps on the screen. And innovated the shitty grab reward system, after removing all promos."
"Look at their first app that provided only transport, to their app now that provides transport, varies type of transport, payment transaction and food delivery.This is a company that is obviously innovating and expanding the services they can provide. You can't say the same for some Singapore companies."
"There are literally thousands of these business magazines around the world coming up with some ranking every week.Like those wine-tasting magazines, this might even be one of those magazines where you can pay a fee to appear on their rankings."
Fast Company is pretty reputable. They're probably among the most reputable as far as technology-focused business publications are concerned.
"This is all I could find on their methodology:This year, Fast Company’s editors and writers sought out groundbreaking businesses across 35 industries and every region. We also judged nominations received through our application process. The 410 organizations we honor here lead their fields and are transforming the world.And the following short article seems to contain their entire analysis about Grab. (This article combines the analyses of both their #1, Meituan Dianping, and #2, Grab, companies.)In the first half of 2018, Meituan Dianping—a Chinese tech platform that expedites the booking and delivery of services such as food, hotel stays, and movie tickets—facilitated 27.7 billion transactions (worth $33.8 billion) for more than 350 million people in 2,800 cities. That’s 1,783 Meituan-enabled services every second of every day, with each customer using it an average of three times a week.Meanwhile, in Southeast Asia, Grab, the Singapore-based ride-hailing company, forced Uber out of the region in 2018 and acquired its local operations. A few months later, it expanded its app to offer its 130 million users not only food delivery and travel booking, but also financial and other services. These efforts helped Grab hit $1 billion in revenue in 2018 and attract more than $3 billion in fresh funding to expand. Later this year, it’ll add healthcare services from Ping An, the Chinese digital health giant.Both Meituan and Grab are what’s known as transactional super apps, amalgamations of lifestyle services that connect hundreds of millions of customers to local businesses. “We want to help millions move through the economy and up the social ladder,” says Grab cofounder Hooi Ling Tan. They may not be well known in the U.S., but Meituan and Grab are changing the lives of hundreds of millions of consumers and millions of merchants with highly complex operations disguised as simple transactions—elegant tech to enable real-world experiences.Meituan, which views food as its core offering, is skilled at leveraging its data regarding users’ consumption habits, including price sensitivity, to recommend other things they’ll like. “Our strategy in integrating different businesses,” says Xia Huaxia, Meituan’s chief scientist, “is to attract a large volume of users with high-frequency services, and then push forward some low- and medium-frequency ones like haircuts and marriage services.” Grab uses transportation data to figure out what services to roll out next. “We’ve been bringing users to these businesses,” Tan says. “Now they can come to you.”Success for a transactional super app requires what Xia calls “a culture of long-term patience.” Meituan is competing fiercely with Alibaba, and although its revenue in the first half of 2018 was $3.8 billion, the company has sustained significant losses as it pursues its vision. Grab is fighting with another startup, Go-Jek, in parts of Southeast Asia. In its effort to win, Grab has opted to partner with the likes of Toyota, Microsoft, and Mastercard rather than build everything itself. “We can be smarter and faster by making the platform more open,” says Tan.Efficiency also drives innovation. Meituan’s Smart Dispatch system, introduced in 2015, schedules which of its 600,000 motorbike riders will deliver the millions of food orders it fulfills daily. It now calculates 2.9 billion route plans every hour to optimize a rider’s ability to pick up and drop off up to 10 orders at once in the shortest time and distance. Since Smart Dispatch launched, it has reduced average delivery time by more than 30%, and riders complete 30 orders a day, up from 20, increasing their income.Uber was once poised to popularize the transactional super app. Instead, Meituan and Grab—and the companies emulating them globally, from Swiggy in India to Rappi, in Latin America—are leapfrogging ahead to build a new model for the service economy for billions of people.In their 2018 ranking, Meituan and Grab were not even in the top 50. What did Meituan and Grab do in the past year that was so innovative that led them to leap-frog to #1 and #2 on their ranking?Which is more likely: that they actually did a serious analysis of how innovative thousands/millions of tech companies around the world were? or that they're just hoping that their story is reproduced by people around the world and commands headlines?"
You are making accusations based on your own wild assumptions and conjectures.There is an application process in order to be considered (the fee is $400 if I'm not mistaken).

"Apple and Google must be kicking themselves because they forgot to apply. All journalism is in a bad state nowadays; can't blame Fast Company for trying to raise revenue in a not especially innovative way, I guess."

Thinking of applying to SUSS. any students here? Is fulltime or part time better?
"I'm doing part time and I'm on my first year, second semester! It's definitely not easy to juggle between school and work; I feel like it could also be my time management but I barely have time for hobbies."
"im considering full time right now, but i hear there's a lot of mandatory community service and other stuff. But from what you're saying is the workload a lot? what about the amount of time you have to spend in school?"
"Oh didn't know about the community service part.For part time students, we don't actually spend a lot of time in school because they're moving a lot of their modules to e-learning. But because each school term is short, the intervals between is assignment is relatively short.And again, you're in control of the pace because you can choose to not max our your modules each semester. You can choose to only take 1 or 2 mods which should be easier to manage, but that also mean you'll take longer to complete the degree."

"travelling for business is not as glamorous as it used to seem for me, I think (immigration can be a pain in the ass + homesick)free food and being the absolute boss of your working hours is nice though"
I think it's universally acknowledged that business travel sucks.Usually the company will try to squeeze ever productive hour out of you and often you have to burn some of the weekends and then deal with the two way jet lag on your own time.
"the thing is...I can fly there/back in the day instead of overnight (and I did/will), I chose to work over the weekend (with off-in-lieu), and hours here are super flexible and really quite good (the last time I was here I chose to do 8-3:30 without lunch).I just feel homesick or something.or maybe I’m a strawberry"

"Is the employment doing fine for Pharm Hons degree holders? Heard really bad stuff about it recently esp with regards to oversaturation of degree holders and a lower demand for them in retail and clinical sector, so was worried if it might affect R&D prospects as the latter is where my interests are."
You can always pull off a Breaking Bad.
You’re doing a degree in pharm?
"Yes, NUS."
"Isn't oversaturation of degree holders an issue for most sectors, not just pharm? So the oversaturation portion doesn't really matter.What I understand about NUS pharm is that the job prospects are available. In fact, among many of the courses in NUS, NUS pharm has one of the highest employment rates if you're looking at retail and clinical sectors.But in terms of R&D and clinical testing, probably you'll need a masters at the very least or a PhD to do well in it.Nevertheless, I'm from the Computing side so it might be best if you were to clarify these issues with seniors from NUS pharm at the open houses"
Thanks for the thorough response.
Oh nice. You’re looking for jobs towards the manufacturing side or..?
PharmD is top priority since clinical testing is my thing. But the plan B is manufacturing and all which are pretty convincing from ppl who told me about their work life there
"Why does the samsung galaxy s8 64gb still cost$998, s8 128gb $1100+ and s9 cost $1200+or $1300+when s10 is gonna be available soon and s10 cost only a bit more from the official samsung stores or official redirected stores from samsung sg webspage like gaincity?"
Are you looking at the RRP? Whymobile shows a new S9 as $900
"I think so? It is from their official store. I want to get from the official store since if i got from third party retailers, samsung service centre may reject having warranty for the phone. s8 and s9 is still expensive though, why no price drops when s10 is going come out."
Just gotta check the listing for the warranty. The companies won't reject you for buying from somewhere not from the official store as long as it has a valid warranty covered by the manufacturer themselves.
I got mine for $750 at redwhitemobile with 1 year samsung warranty
I got my Xiaomi from redwhite too. No issues so far
Can you get circumcised in NS is that a good idea
You can i once met some one who did
can religion reasons be ok?
"I would think so, i think you'd just need a doctor's recommendation but i would think those are relatively easy to get."
Eh ask him sunat can claim or not and how many days off
"someone i know got 2 weeks off, but apparently it can take longer if you don't clean properly and get infection"
What if you get an erection instead tho?
"When you're an NSF all medical procedure is free, you only get the MC days"

High level to keng mc
...Why?
To keng LMAO why not+ potential pros and cuz I have a nasty case of phimosis
There are better ways to Keng like Tonsillectomy or Appendectomy. Your Tonsil and Appendix doesn't have much function to begin with so you have the option to remove them to prevent complications later in life.Some women or men (idk your sexuality) will not like cut penis. Are you sure you'd want to undergo such permanent change to your sexual organ?
Mate my foreskin is tighter than an infants pussy I’d be happy to circumcise especially since the potential pros outweigh the cons
make a permanent modification to your body just to kengyou must hate NS a lot
"Orh, for the leave...Why not just get it done in a hospital before you book in? You really trust the MO to handle your foreskin ah?"
"the fuck, MO don't handle surgical procedures la they are your normal GP"
that's not how it works. you get a referral to do it outside. only for medical reasons tho.
Ok but say I have phimosis is that a valid reason
religion reasons can?
No no no

"Currently in HK for a short trip, and since I can't speak canto, and that HKers don't really like mainlanders, I find myself in a situation where I try to speak English over Chinese, but risk them not being able to understand me, or me understanding them. If I speak Chinese, they would automatically assume I'm a mainlanders instead, and their attitude is quite apparent... Is it just me? (and yes I try to learn canto but it's definitely not going to be enough for me to be conversant)"
"If I speak Chinese, they would automatically assume I'm a mainlanders instead, and their attitude is quite apparentThey definitely wont. They are smart enough to differentiate between China accent and Singaporean accent, just like we can tell between HK and China accent. Furthermore, just don't act like those stuck up, entitled Chinese tourists and I'm sure they'll treat you fine anyway.I tend to just go Canto or Chinese with the older folks, Canto or English with the younger folks, works out fine."
"Spent 4 months there. Yep speaking english is usually safer. Some people do tend to be quite rude if you use chinese (and HK service standards are already known to be not very good haha). Or you could just mix english and chinese and make it seem obvious that you are not a mainlander, if you wanna get your point across."

"Doesn't matter. We dont have the China accent when speaking Mandarin. When I went to Hong Kong last year, I spoke to majority of the stall owners at the various night markets in Manadarin and they didn't showed any prejudice or wtv. They knew we aren't mainlanders from our accent."
Advice from friends who went to HK -> Just speak English.
"Yeah, so far I'm just speaking English throughout, using Chinese as a last resort... Just frustrating sometimes"
"Hi redditors, so I can collect my passport from today onwards but bc I need it by Monday can I just head to ICA tmr and collect without appointment? (Bc the next available one is in 5 days) Willing to wait hours to collect but just need some reassurance so I don’t make a wasted trip"
"If it is ready for collection, should be able to. Just register and wait for your number."
"if they tell u passport is raedy to collect, u can go, that time i made an appointment but i was like 30 mins late, i cab and ran, still was late, the ticketing machine was closed at 5pm, so i just proceed to the counter. They actually jumped my queue, theres like a couple of people infront of me lol, and it took like 15mins only. To be sure, just give them a call la"
does anyone have experience about your parents disapproval of your relationship? Kindly share your story with me cuz I'm facing the same problem. My boyfriend Mom disapprove our relationship and force my boyfriend break up with me
Eh same. At the start my mum also don’t approve of my r/s with my gf. So we had to date in secret for 2 years before she finally came to terms w it. Was not easy but we were still happy together. Although ultimately we separated for different reasons later on
"I'm someone from the other side. My whole family, including myself, disapproves of my sibling's rs. Regardless of the reasons why, if you want to stick it out and achieve some positive result, be prepared to keep on suffering until then because really it is never just about you two.Sorry if I sound harsh. But it can be hard to change a parent's mindset especially when by default most will consider the end result i.e. potential marriage into the family. Doesn't matter whether you have been unfairly blamed or if the S/O is a real bitch (like my sibling's)."
"both my relationship my mom was disapproving because of the other party's race. Yeap, shes pretty fucking selfish, i voiced out my issues i faced daily with my mother's constant negative speech about our relationship, my ex didnt take it so well and then we started to fight which led to an end. My current relationship is under attack by my mom too, she has her reasons so to make things happy, to each of its own lo."
"It seen really harder than my situation, I know like different cultures and different race is damn hard to get approval from parents. Hope your mom will change her mind someday, Good luck!"
"Need some backstory, what was the reason for her disapproval?"
"she think I bring the “unlucky”to her family. Like when we on relationship about 2 month his mother injured and his Father got diabetes and recurrence since we on relationship about 4 month.And when I stay at their home, after my shower my boyfriend want to help me dry out my hair but she thought was I asking my boyfriend to dry out my hairBtw my boyfriend are the only son and child at his family.Without give me a chance to explain she just force my boyfriend break up with meAnd also got lot of misunderstand case like, I throw the tissue at bathroom never clean up the tissue, and she thought the tissue was my make up cleansing sheets, so I show her my cleaning sheet which I used was at the trash can. After that she told my boyfriend I am very stingy"
"Walao this kind of pantang parents... they are really a nightmare, and will only get much worse if you guys really end up married in the long run. In an ideal world I would say that if you love the guy then fk what others think, all that matters is you 2. But practically speaking, in Singapore when you marry the person you also marry the family. Just keep in mind the pantang will only pile up when you have wedding stuff, pregnancy, childbirth, and so on. Each one got a different drama one. So you know, just think about whether this is the right guy lo"
"IMO if the parents are so pantang, it usually means they're hard to reason with."
"Oh man that sucks.. She shouldn't blame it on you. Injuries are accidental or may be due to carelessness and negligence. Diabetes isn't some thing that you can develop in 4 months..She asked your boyfriend to break up in front of you? What's your boyfriend take on this?Tbh not to be a wet blanket but most relationships without the blessings of the parents tends to fail, unless, you elope with him. Otherwise it is just going to be a very tedious and tiring process.I don't know how else to help you but I think try to move her in other ways? For example, bring his parents out for dinners, help his mom to carry groceries when you can and let her bond with you to know you as a person?Don't go heads-on-heads with her, let your boyfriend do the convincing. All the best <3"
"I do helps her something which is not my responsibilities though, like at my boyfriend go Germany because the NS. But his parents need to done some formalities for their new house cuz they are going to move to new house.I help her to bring my boyfriend father to community center which is damn far from my home (I stay at yishun, and my boyfriend stay at boon lay) to do some formalities that I not really know, but I still helping because their parents can't even read English as well. After that I followed his mother to supermarket buy some food for cook, and all the thing is carry by me cuz I'm taller. I'm also help to wash the dish and folding clothes when my boyfriend is not around.My boyfriend don't even dare to say No to his mother which is make me disappointed the mostSo we keep our relationship under the ground, but still.. his mother found out.. And force AGAINShe didn't force my boyfriend break up with me in front on me, she didn't even knows I knew she force boyfriend breakup with me."
If your SO can't say no to his mum or defend you then if day you dodged a bullet. Congrats!
Wa superstitious much??? I think just finding excuses to blame somebody ba.
"I'm very sorry if I offended you I didn't mean any harm, Im also had friend who come from China, they were very friendly and kind. I been China before so I know it, but what I try to say it's just an individual case. sorry for my commandment English, and thanks for your guidance. Hope you had a nice weekend "

Going to register for driving. Not sure whether to join auto/manual.Which would you all recommend given that i might drive overseas also?
"Depends on your interest in driving as a whole. If you are keen on learning how the gears work, learn manual. If you just want the license so you can drive to get from one place to another, get auto. Auto cars are more expensive overseas (mainly in Europe) but tbh if you don’t drive a manual car in Singapore, it probably isn’t safe for you to drive a manual car overseas on unfamiliar roads."
"Auto is easier to pass/learn. Manual is if you are also interested to drive vans/buses or have any chance to do so. Last time I used to hear ""Take manual, overseas only have manual cars"", pfft. All of my friends said auto cars are just as ubiquitous."
Just do auto. Other countries confirm will have some auto cars avail for rental one what.
"There's not much difference except that one is slightlier easier to drive. I initially thought of learning manual, but forgo the idea of it as most of my friends who had manual license are driving Auto now."
Saw a Chinese woman came out from squatting by the bushes. Not even fully covered i.e. incoming cars could see her.
"When you gotta go, you gotta go."
Nature calls man
Nature called the woman
"i would be worried af sia, if keep beo girl but nv beo the road = both gg. kdrama aint real life lol, if i was a girl and the dude is a rubbish driver who cant even keep his steering straight and steal glances at me I would dump him straight instead of endangering my life.Personally witnessed this when I book GrabShare. Dude was a young chap that looks 25 driving his gf as well. Kept talking all the rubbish about what movie to see later etc. I was behind and was lik 'Dude wdf, can you drive properly or not? I know this is a Merc that cost $150k that your daddy bought for you but you almost just killed us earlier zzz'. I usually use phone and dont bother to wear seatbelt but for him I went the extra mile hahaBugger cant drive straight properly and yet keep wanting to overtaking other vehicles WHILE talking to his gf lol. Pls dont do this, gt other time to be romantic to gf but driving on the road aint one."
"It's like ""wow my life is in his hands wow look at him checking blindspots wow look at how he steer the steering wow"""
Like that put a couple in a small room also can have heart to heart talk ma
Small space enough tbh
people get blown while driving.....
"sometimes i find myself losing interest way too fast, i try to learn new stuff or read a book but never bother to follow through or continue. or am i finding excuses for myself?what do guys. i feel like a piece of shit lmao trying to pick up something in ns life but the laziness/procrastination is real fml"

Currently in ntu studying mechanical engineering and my final year project cant seem to get the correct result. Abit worried since i am pretty sure i wouldnt be able to get the correct result.Wondering if anybody experienced this and will i fail?
Hey I totally feel you. About to hand in my FYP project now and I'm unable to fulfill the requirements. Consult your supervisor will be the best bet. My supervisor just ghosted on us..
sadly it won't be like the old funan we remember :(
"the old funan only attracted a niche and nearby office diners, i cant imagine it being successful as a casual mall even with the new tunnel crossing the road. look at capital theatre, its practically a graveyard and its in a better location than funan"
"Because the food options weren’t that great before. Food court on the TOP floor, a subway, kfc, OCK, Ya Kun, and a couple Japanese spots.This is much bigger and most likely will have more food options. The stores inside will probably be better as well"
a nicheit was a niche that loves to spend and to spend a lot though. lots of tech geeks who love updating their gear to the latest and best just for the sake of it. i'm not so sure about this new 'lifestyle mall' direction funan is trying to take. i hope they at least retain some of their previous key tenants.
"Except those tech geeks would rather go to Sim Lim than Funan. Better selection, more specialised, and usually cheaper."
not for photo gear
old Funan had several excellent camera stores with much nicer service than at SLT where aggressive sellers ruin everything.
"Old Funan was home to my favourite brick and mortar game store: GameScore. Made a couple friends there (I still remember the online forum lmao) including the store owners, bought so many games and they helped to bring in collector editions on my request, and also won a Metal Gear Solid 4 ps3 from their annual lucky draw."
The reflection in the mirrored part makes Funan read like lousy instead.
Omg!!! Lol. It means it’s the opposite of lousy
"oh damn it does look like it, a sign of things to come?"
Nostalgia always tastes better...
Just like my ex
Challenger will still be there!😊
I miss queuing for midnight sale with like-minded geeks. Love the excitement and atmosphere.
"Eh... I get the atmosphere point but I'm thankful that we now all have the option to just buy the same game of Steam rather than queue up at midnight, often for lousy premiums (t-shirts you'd never wear) and bad ""performances"" (usually involving girls dressed in revealing outfits that have very little to do with the actual game that you are buying).Source: queued up for Warcraft 3 launch as a kid."
"i don't understand why it involves girls dressed in revealing outfits, imho not everything sex can sell. i came to buy the game not the ogle the woman, you think im some waifu otaku? -_-"""
"Beats me too, but publishers still think that their main demographic are teenage boys so booth babes are still a thing (although thankfully in recent years it's become a much smaller practice)."
It will not be an IT mall anymore tho
So we loose Sim Lim at the end of this month. Where else to got It ?
"huh, sim lim is going?"
https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/bye-bye-sim-lim-square-shop-owners-make-bid-en-bloc-sale
Owners agree to enbloc sale doesn't mean the developers will be willing to come in at the price that they want
The price they are seeking $1.1b is a little bit on the high side. I think it's just to get owners to agree to the sale.
Ah this is sad news. I hope Zeppelin & co. will relocate. Love that cafe.
I always don’t remember which of the four corners it is hidden at...
They one next to the lifts
"You see my friend, I also have trouble looking for the right exit out of building, from the four available. So I guess it is me. 😭"
Same. Whenever I try to head to MRT I always take the wrong exit. Then to get there I always have to walk pass the sex toy store.
The sex store.
Wait...are they still alive now? I still have yet to visit them. My ears are itching.
"Online, lazada shopee amazon newegg"
"Don't buy from Newegg, with the new Chinese owners their quality assurance and customer service has gone downhill"
"Didn’t know newegg was now owned by Chinese. I’ve been waiting on my mound for four months now, and only just got my refund from my bank last week.Newegg were hopeless, first claiming it was sent, then back ordered, and then sent but lost."
Lazada also now Chinese owners what
IIRC They have been for a few years.That's why Redmart merging with Lazada mah. Same mama company.
Yeah there are only two players in SG really. Alibaba and Amazon. Own most of the things
No no Lazada's quality assurance and customer service is very good so much be non-Chinese owners /s
Confirm closing down alr arh?
We'll really lose Sim Lim? Source?I always buy my stuff online anyway
"Damn, did the en-bloc sale go through? I'm out of the loop. xD"
Both sim lim square and tower or only one of em?
Woah! It's your 1st Cakeday HisPri! hug
So what mall is it going to be?a random run of the mill mall?
"""Lifestyle"" mallDon't ask what is it tho, I have no idea"
Synonym for 'generic'
Unfortunately there is much less demand for physical IT shops nowadays.
"I miss the old Funan, and I mainly came there because my father wanted to buy IT goods, and we always ate prata at the 5th floor foodcourt. In Level 6, there was a Challenger store that we came to frequently. Aah, such memories, but Funan would never be the same again."
"back when challenger was 24/7, heading there to buy a HDMI cable at 3am was quite the adventure"
It was always good to know there was a 24 shop in town for any last minute IT shopping / cable needs. I was kinda sad when they stopped the 24 hour service.
Well we still got Mustafa I guess.
What situation exists where you'll need to get IT stuff at 3am
Once I needed to get a hard disk / cables for a presentation first thing in the morning (or imagine for someone before flying off). It was nice knowing there'd be somewhere to go if ever you needed it!!
"OK yeah that's fair enough, was mostly picturing a drunk guy in neon paint stumbling around the store"
That mental image cracked me up way too much
"I've been in overnight IT work crunches where we suddenly needed an extra hard drive or a replacement GPU. The 24/7 Challenger was super nice compared to Mustafa's moldy basement where a ""CAT-6"" labeled cable might in fact not even be rated for 10mbps."
"I miss the taco bell, pizza hut, and kfc.Most ambitious crossover in history"
We had taco bell?!?!
Yeah back when I was a kid I used to eat Taco Bells at Funan. IIRC I got a Darth Maul toy from there (might be wrong tho)
Toy or not i'm more surprised we had Taco Bell at all. I was 7 when A&W closed down too so i wasn't able to try it out by myself haha.
I heard A&W's gonna open at airport right? Now's your chance!
Yep jewel at airport will be the location for their first restoran
There was one at Kovan Heartland Mall too
"So so long ago, when I was barely in pri school. Frequently visited the outlet in the Jurong Mall (which has been demolished and replaced by.. Jcube?)Got the full Taco Bell experience as well: ate Taco Bell, then had terrible stomachache."
"Well had no cash, no time. Parents wouldn't let me even go out back then. I hear A&Ws coming back so 1 blessing at a time."
"Yup. The KFC used to have three menus in a single store. KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut."
All owned by YumFoods which is why they crossover. It is hard to find a combination of all 3-in-1 but I’ve come across many 2-in-1 before in the US. Mostly KFC/Taco Bell though
"As far as i remember, prices were not that competitive. What made the place special was the knowledgeable guys that worked there which had some kind of cult towards technology. Were prices really that good?"
"some of the more reputable photo gear stores had relatively good prices compared to rrp. many practiced discriminatory pricing if a customer was new or seemed like a noob eg. looks young though. regulars ie. hobbyists who change gear for the fun of it, or professionals who have a relationship with the staff got the best prices."
"Exactly. And in terms of convenience and price, they can’t beat Qoo10, Lazada and Amazon. Wrong time to go all in on brick and mortar shops."
Don't you mean LnUgU
When is it opening omg
Full opening by June 2019.
Was thinking how did Funan became Lnugu hahah
"Not gonna be an IT place anymore, more like a mishmash of luxury brands and playpens just like any normal shopping mall. That's the way they've planned it from day one. Felt abit sick when I saw those plans"
Yeah i still miss that floor where all the game shops were and attending all those midnight launches for games like Gears of War 3 and Halo 3.
arent they recording biometrics of anyone who walks into the mall? ill give this place a pass
"From an earlier article:Some of the features at the new mall include an interactive directory that uses facial recognition to provide customised recommendations, video analytics to study shopper traffic and crowd density and those living at the residences will be able to use an app for social networking and room booking.So avoid if you seriously don't want a corporation to have info of your face"
"I don't think it's far fetched to say that they can get your id and particulars too, just by stepping into view. The ""customised recommendations"" also scary, clearly saying that they will give/sell our info away."
wear a mask :X
serious ah??! that's crazy
"damn i miss the old funan, i used to go there alot to buy my pc items and that was where i bought parts for my first pc, it wasnt always crowded too which was nice. I heard new funan wont be an it mall? Is it true?:("
I heard new funan wont be an it mall? Is it true?:(n o r m i e sbuying regular normie things
Maybe you'll have the standard package of Uniqlo in the mall
also the 4th floor maid cafe is not coming back sry
LMAOOO SINCE WHEN HAVE HAHA i never see before le
Hoping for the return of weeb merch
"It even looks like they kept the weird side entrance... We shall see if they really come through with having new and interesting concepts instead of more of the same Zara, Uniqlo, Department Store, McDonalds, KFC format... (Also bring back Taco Bell)"
"Funan was my childhood. I had Tution nearby every Sunday, so my family would always stop by there on Sundays to eat and sometime let my siblings and I go to the top floor challenger and game on the free display sets there. Good memories."
"I think if this is slated to be a lifestyle mall (as claimed) it'll see quite a bit of traffic - simply because it's nearer to office buildings, it's literally a stone's throw from City Hall and the shops in a ""lifestyle"" place tend to be a bit more affordable. That said, I'm going to miss the IT stuff - I remember the old Funan as a more honest version of Sim Lim with a slightly higher median quality.Some people mentioned Capitol Piazza - don't take that as a gauge. The reason why it's imploding is because it was branded as an upscale mall (think of ION, Paragon, Scotts Sq. etc.) but the target audiences for these tend to be at Orchard Road rather than City Hall. The very public spat between the hotel and the mall owners (before Kempinski took over) didn't really help matters either."
normie shoppimg centre now miss when it fueled my weeb tendencies.
nothing here move on...
"I’ve never been to the old Funan mall before, only heard about it whenever it made the news. Now that Wild Rice is having their theatre there, my first trip there might just be watching a production"
"Damn, you're making me feel really old now. xD"
Anyone know who will be inside?
Glad they kept the elevator design still to have some semblance of the old one.
I miss watching World Cup in the old atrium!
I miss going to Funan and checking out their niche hobby and comic book shops
the memories...
Memories buying physical videogames in an actual store...
does it still have that one anime shop upstairs
La Tendo? It’s at Suntec now.
Lnugu
I remember buying my NDS from old Funan back in 2007. Also remembered trying Ninja Gaiden on the original Xbox at Challenger back in 2004 and being in awe.Really great times.
the new Wildrice theatre will be there! excitingg.
Wow. Wonder if there will still be a pasta mania.Hope the management looks into making it a place for IT geeks to hang out.
"mah theyve already announced the flagship stores incoming, its a place for normies"
What kind of stores do they have that make it a normie place?
Old funan is a geek haven for gamers and IT for people who want somewhere more reputable and less scary than Sim Lim. Also a place for otakus apparently; heard lots of ppl go there for figurines.
"That I know, but what's in the new building that makes it normie?"
Basically it has nothing from before and everything that every other mall has.
Really? Where is this list?
Haha and tacobell. Lol
Heard there might be a rock climbing spot in there too? Haha looking forward to the Wild Rice theatre!!!
It's just going to be yet another place for normies. Yawn.
Hopefully the food court won't be too expensive.
"Not on a Minister's pay, reportedly."
Lnugu? (Funky reflection)
"Funan IT Mall is popular because it's well....IT mall if you want your IT stuff you go there although it's not as convenient as other malls nearby. remember i got my first tablet & laptop with my first full time job salary over there.For them to transform the mall as a ""creative hub"" which i don't exactly know what does it mean, I don't think it'll work out well."
Forgot this place existed! Gonna add new life to the City Hall area
Capitaland logo really throwback to the nineties. Can’t they redesign one of these days?
Why fix what ain't broken? What is it with Singaporeans and making changes to things just for the sake of it?
"If it’s any comfort to you, I oppose demolition of still functional buildings (or quasi functional, up to rehabilitation), like old funan or golden mile. But if you are going to do it anyways, why not update the ugly lettering topping half the towers of cbd? Maybe it’s a personal ocd... :)"
"Even better, don't put the logo there in the first place 🌚 I think I'd kinda enjoy the cleaner and more functional look"
I hear it has a indoor track inside
Hope theres an apple store

"Yes, but they’re removing it and changing it into a left side exit.Source: LTA and the attached map."
"Good riddance, it’s just not right. What are we, KL?"
But it is... right...
"KL: I see you’ve missed your exit, why not circle the whole entire city just to reach your desired location."
somehow the proposed change reminded me of mario kart 🏎
I actually have very fond memories of this exit.
Lol. Used to stay in upper bukit timah. The number of people that jam brake because they didn't realize the right most lane is the exit is too damn high.
Thats right. badum tsss
"Alright, The exit is to your.. Right."
"Yes, this the last right hand expressway exit. They are gonna remove it soon and they are building another exit too. The reason why is because all the buses and truck wants to use that exit have to filter from left side of the express way to the right. Which will cause safety hazard for the road users."
Remove spaced streams PP when
"Oh, is there only one? No wonder when I always wake up when the bus go through this road XD always felt it was special... good times"
Only part of the highway where the left lanes are usually faster
A move that makes sense but we gonna miss this exit
Yup. The only one in the entire country.
This is the exit that indicates I'm near home whenever I'm in a car. Feels.
"Damn I should've titled this ""last right side expressway exit left in SG?"""
"Ah this exit, i remember a lorry stopping at the exit divider as it was beginning to smoke heavily- pretty sure it caught fire"
They are going to remove it soon due to high accident rates.
The exit that caused much frustrations in a 50km/h speed limit vehicle
"The Substation's artistic director Alan Oei (above) is leaving the arts venue by the end of the year.The 42-year-old told The Straits Times he would be returning to his art practice after leaving The Substation.Before he took on the post, the artist-curator was known for creating the quirky OH! Open House tours, in which home owners opened their homes to host artworks for public tours. Open House is an ongoing concern, with a new programme lined up for next month.On his four-year tenure at the independent arts venue, Oei said: ""When I came in, it was with a plan to explore the city and 2019 is the concluding year.""Programmes such as 2016's Each Blade Of Grass Each Shrub Each Tree, inspired by the debate over the Cross Island Line, and 2017's Discipline The City, which explored the politics of space, were part of such explorations.For the rest of this year, he added, The Substation programme will investigate the new public space that has opened up in front of it. The stretch of Armenian Street has been closed to traffic and redeveloped as a new urban park by National Parks Board.Although he is staying on till the end of the year, The Substation has already announced its search for a new artistic director on its Facebook page. It posted a call for applicants last Friday.Oei said the early call was to avoid a leadership vacuum. ""Finding an artistic director takes a long time. If you can find an artistic director early, he or she can plan programmes early as well. The Substation has a policy of appointing artists to lead the space. And the incoming director will have a longer runway to learn how things work in The Substation.""Mr Chew Kheng Chuan, chairman of The Substation's board of directors, added: ""I appreciate his giving us the time to commence the critical process of identifying his successor as early as possible, to allow the organisation to manage the transition to the sixth artistic director without a disruptive lacuna.""Before Oei came on board in 2015, The Substation faced a nine-month gap in leadership after the previous artistic director, Noor Effendy Ibrahim, stepped down.Mr Chew acknowledged Oei's contribution to the space, which was founded in 1990 by the late drama doyen Kuo Pao Kun.He said: ""Under his tenure, which continues until the end of the year, programmes have been designed to extend beyond the arts and connect with Singapore at large. This effort to foster engagement and discussion on a broader level has helped to reposition The Substation as a relevant voice in our rapidly changing arts ecosystem.""Oei's early decision to phase out venue rental and review programming at The Substation upset some members of the arts community, who saw the changes as anathema to the institution's roots as a berth for experimental art-making.Some remain critical of Oei.Poet Cyril Wong, who was a programme manager at The Substation from 2002 to 2008, said: ""His tenure has turned The Substation into an overly inward organisation, closed off from much of the different performance art forms.""The Substation used to be a conscientiously inclusive arts organisation that encouraged collaboration between different kinds of artists, especially artists who weren't easily classified.""It was a space for difference and for artistic growth and development; for artists to try new things and talk meaningfully to one other, especially between genres and generations of artists.""But some are supportive of the changes Oei has introduced. Composer Song-Ming Ang said: ""There are plenty of expectations that can weigh down anyone directing the oldest independent arts space in Singapore, but Alan directed it with boldness and a strong sense of focus and adventure. The programmes he put out speak for themselves - at once thoughtful, creative, complex and inclusive.""The Substation was always meant to be an experimental, welcoming space to cater to the needs of young, local artists and various alternative communities. I think he's fulfilled this mandate extremely well."""
"Hello everyone, been mostly a lurker for a while but since I had some free time today inbetween shuttling around meeting clients I'd thought I'd do an AMA just to give everyone a better picture of what its like to be a regular.

Never imagined that there would be so many questions...hope I managed to at least help those enlisting soon/thinking of signing on, and helping to at least clarify some doubts about the SAF. It's getting a little tiring so I'll try to answer any more questions as soon as I can but thanks for the support everyone. Let me know if I should do another one soon! :-)O7"
are you going to join SMRT
Asking the right questions
Only former CDFs can join lah.
Er no why would I?
"Joke based on how many ex saf officers of high rank have been given top posts in government agencies ministries and government linked companies, SMRT being the most prominent. This is linked to unhappiness over the perceived lack of meritocracy over these appointments and concerns of cronyism which undermines public faith."
Haha I see...well no la I've a pretty comfortable job now.
What are some major issues that only regulars face but NSFs/NSmen often misunderstand?
"For me I think NSFs/NSmen don't understand that being a regular is almost like any other career in the civil service, where we contend with issues like promotion, CEP, scholars, etc. For me, I'm a farmer, so I knew that my CEP was only up till MAJ or maybe LTC if I had stayed a bit longer. NSFs and NSmen tend to equate regulars with the organisation but we're also human, we have our own gripes about the force"
"We know, but we also know regulars have nsf as minions to do saikang"
"Yes, but I think it boils down to how the regular communicates such requests to NSFs. For me, I would have stuck with them and then once the things are done I'll reward them, but I know of experiences of others who just delegate and then go off, which in my opinion is not ideal"
"Yea that is like 30% of the regulars, but 70% treat us like maid.Area cleaning etc, shouldnt regulars be part of the roster or at least clean their own area?At least regulars can be a mini “boss” of their own..."
"I cannot speak for your experience, but I just hope that all regulars don't treat NSFs like free labour or cattle. When I was in unit, I cleaned my own bunk though."
You will be surprised to know that it is the norm...
I'm sorry to hear that
major issuesI see what you did there
"I think one point that regulars can relate to is that REG today are teachers, coaches, facilitators, mentors, friends all rolled into one. It is crucial to learn and understand these roles so as to perform to the best of your abilities and lead by example.Using a company commander role to explain, one has to care for his men’s training and welfare needs, not to mention engagement with their parents and reassurance that their sons are under the charge and proper responsibility of a young CPT between 28-32 yrs old."
"Thats true. Actually, quite a few regulars leave to become teachers or coaches because of the passion they found when doing instruction tours."
Is there a way to find out what’s our CEP?
"From my experience, the best way is to have a good boss who knows and is willing to tell you. No one really knows the fullproof concrete way to calculate CEP, but I'm guessing its a range of factors like: scholar vs non scholar, performance ranking, tours you've done, etc."
Thank you for your service.
"Thank you, that means a lot"
"in the event of a war, do you think SAF is sufficiently prepared?"
"My honest hand to heart answer is yes, but not a prolonged war."
Thats why a swift and decisive victory is in our mission statement! :)
Reminds me a lot about Japan during WW2. We cannot afford to be indecisive. Japan and the US made misjugements during the war but it cost Japan so much more.
"Where got an army that is prepared for a war of attrition? History showed us that it doesn't exist, they can only make the best of what they have."
Hmmm...how about the Cold War Soviet Union?
"My boi, allow me to introduce you to Helmuth von Moltke the Elder."
"Do you have concerns over SAF manpower needs being met in the future, especially for army and infantry in particular? Am in a unit that was at red con 3 even before we move out because so many people down pes and mindef has no one people to give to us. Hear from my friends that their battalions have similar issues. With our birth rates falling, this problem will only get worse, not better.If it is a concern, what needs to happen to rectify? Do we go with all volunteer system (rsaf RSn seems to mainly regulars)? Or do we conscript women?"
"Wow what unit was that?Yes birth rates is falling and so NSF batches slowly dwindle every year, but that to me seems more of a top management kind of issue they need to tackle because realistically as a MAJ I can't do much to change the entire SAF. For what its worth though, I'm all for getting women to serve NS. If Israel can do it, so can we."
Does being ex-SAF exempt you from the Official Secrets Act?
"To be honest I'm really not too sure, although I guess it's better to er on the side of caution and maintain opsec"
"When I was in my s4 branch, the contractor that assist us with building maintenance told me he was ex saf and had done secret ops for saf before and that it involves a lot of resting, sleeping and playing as part of the perks. But when I asked him what was it. He say osa cannot say, even after 10 years."
No
"Thoughts on the ""White Horse"" system which is an open secret? Before enlisting I always thought that it was a myth, until I was in a white horse coy in BMTC as confirmed by my sergeants and could see the vast difference between my slack coy and neighbouring coy.If you were the Minister or Chief of Defence, how would you improve the SAF? I personally feel that the chaokeng culture is too prevalent (at least in the Army among NSFs) and there are not enough incentives to be a combatant. Would be happy to share my personal experiences if you want some elaboration."
"Personally, I think this whole white horse mentality came about because commanders had this fear that you pushed them too hard or scolded them, they would tell their parents who will feedback to the SAF and you'll get 'marked' in your career, which I think is largely false because I have not heard of any real-life tangible experiences of people being marked for doing so. When I was in unit, I had a mini white horse (father was an MP) but I treated them all the same, even confined them, etc. and nothing happened to me.Tough to answer your second question because I'm not CDF CEP, if not I wouldn't be a MAJ now hahaha....I can only say that from someone in middle management, what needs to be improved is more top management being involved with the ground work and increasing the presence on the ground, not so much for us but more for the NSFs and junior officers so that they can get some exposure to senior officers and the senior officers can also get a glimpse of what is happening on the ground. Not to say that this is not being done, but like you said I think more can be done. For the chaokeng culture, yes its prevalent but there's only so much we can do, because ultimately it's up to the individual to decide how he wants his NS to be like - contribute meaningfully and get a positive attitude, or just wasting his days chasing the next opportunity to get out of camp."
"li hong yi went through our batch, we didnt call him a white horse but he was instead a golden dragon"
"About the Tsunami relief efforts... More than clearing the debris, there were also floating bodies to be dealt with? How was the experience for you and your men? What effect has it left on you or them?"
"The most lasting impression we had was the smell. The moment I left the LST, the putrid smell of decomposition REALLY hits you. So people do slightly drastic things like drip a hankerchief with feng you to try and mask the smell...but it still gets you. Till this day, I can never forget the smell of mass decomposition.Prior to us sailing off, we had some training by defence psychologists to mentally prep us for what we could expect on the ground. I remember something along the lines of disassociation, where the guy taught us that it was important to not relate the dead bodies that we saw with a family member or friend (e.g. if you saw a dead girl floating, and if you had a young daughter, if you associated the two, you're fucked). This happened to one of the warrant officers (didn't know him personally though)"
Thanks for sharing! That must be tough... And to remember the smell. Part of me was interested because we (most of us) do not encounter these scenarios as a peace time army. I supposed being there gave a realistic but haunting picture of mass devastation...
"No problem at all :-) That was my first real 'ops' as a LTA...but its a memory that will always accompany me (and haunt me I guess?)One thing I don't get about those keyboard warriors online is this whole paper general comments thing. When he was still in the SAF as a colonel, Tan Chuan Jin led our contingent at Meulaboh where apart from the usual meetings with officials, etc, he also did the dirty work with us and was one of the first to help move debris. I think while the SAF has never been involved in a 'real war', we have had lots of people going overseas for peacekeeping missions in active warzones, and its a whole new ball game."
"Yup, those familiar with TCJ and OFE really respect him for it.Pai seh, I volunteered to go as an NSF but got rejected as I was already deployed overseas plus NSF.Really appreciate the work you guys did there!"
"Wow that's interesting, he was probably Comd 7 SIB back then. Very interesting to read that he was also part of the all hands on deck to get things done."
"I think its very easy for those who don't know to label all high flyers as paper generals, because in reality they really do a lot of ground work and make the effort to know their men, etc. and not just sit in the office all day. Even for operational experience, yes they may not have been involved in a war, but there are many real ops that takes place (e.g. SARS, peacekeeping) and other more secret ones that the public doesn't know about. If anything, I would gladly follow some of our top management to war because I know they have the experience to conduct ops"
"if you saw a dead girl floating, and if you had a young daughter, if you associated the two, you're fuckedThanks for sharing. Sorry if I’m being insensitive, but what do you mean by “you’re fucked”?"
"you break down and become mentally incapacitated to do things. For example, that warrant officer that I cited, he suddenly became very emotionless and later very quiet, even though he was very energetic and friendly before we left. He was out of action for a few days while undergoing counselling...I can't fully describe it but it's a kind of PTSD?"
Keen to know too. I could only imagine the smell of rotten flesh..
Smells like really bad cheese.i’ve been to a lot of cases and it just smells putrid and piss.the smell sticks to your clothes.I’m an ex-SCDF NSF
"When I got back from Indonesia, I threw away all my uniforms cause somehow they never smelled the same again. I'm sure as a SCDF NSF you've seen your fair share of dead bodies, some of them for weeks I would think, but to have that smell on a mass scale (over hundreds) is something very different."
Yeah and for that i appreciate your effort o7
"Same as to you, I think our SCDF really deserves a lot of recognition"
1 last question:Canteen or Cookhouse food :P
Have you tried Clementi Camp canteen food? ;-)I'm quite a stickler for food so cookhouse food for me is just to get nutrients in your body and that's it...haha
"Sweet jesus, was just posted there and I’m so glad I can eat chicken cutlet rice for the rest of my NS."
Is the commando cutlet still there?
"I’m pretty fresh, just 2 days at Clementi. Is that something I should try asking for?"
"Ask around for the commando cutlet, see if its still there :-)"
They change already now use popcorn chicken :/ same name but abit diff
Is it still as spicy??
"Depends on your definition of spicy I guess haha, should be, I can barely finish it alone cuz my stomach will hate me after that"
"I see, maybe I'll contact some of my buddies at Clementi to see if they can tabao some for me ;-) I've an iron stomach so spiciness is not a problem"
Lions den one is still spicy and will make you fat.
"How's work after leaving mindef? Did mindef being on your CV get you in to jobs that you wanted?Also, how much do you miss being a regular?"
"I'm working in management consultancy (lobang from a old friend). As for the MINDEF credential being on the CV, it didn't have much impact for me but I know other fellow ex-regulars whose 'second career' was helped by the MINDEF branding. For example, one of my company 2IC last time did a tour in some PR role in the army, and that helped him to get a job at a PR agency"
"Sorry, realised I miss this - Yes I miss it, but i'm also happy with where I am so no complaints"
Why did u sign on in the first place? What were your qualifications and what is ur plan from now on?
"To be honest I signed on because I came from a low income single parent family (father left when I was very young), so I needed the money to support my mother and siblings. But along the way in OCS, I found passion in the job (and to an extent, serving the country too), and so I decided to stick on.Qualifications wise, just a basic degree from NTU. My plan now...I guess just to continue putting food on the table and spending more time with my family. As I shared somewhere here, my last tour was with a very shitty boss and his unreasonable demands took a lot of time away from family."
Thank you for your insights! :) all the best in your future endeavour!!
"As a Junior occifer, I am always stucked between my OC and the Enciks. Sometimes I try to help my men to fight for welfare and rights but my Enciks will deny them infront of my men. My OC couldnt care much too.Do you think regulars have a power Complex? As a NSF occifer, all I wanted to do was to learn and help my men in every ways I could. I don't understand why some regulars like to use their power. I am not even fighting with their ranking.What is your take on this?"
"Well we're all human beings so there are those with a power complex - looking back, I think I did had some when I was a 2LT/LTA before finally maturing up. In any case, it all boils down to what you do with the cards dealt to you - make the best of a bad situation I say."
Like all other jobs there are people who just like to throw their rank/seniority/power around - Maybe the regimentation in the army makes this easierthere could be other reasons why your men are not getting the benefits you are trying to provide. It could be to maintain parity within the coy or Bn but either way imo the Encik should have explained to you instead of just revoking it in front of your men. It’s your OCs job to manage the dynamics within the coy team
"Imo, it's all team based and not rank based.Ranks generally show what you're good at, and officers are supposedly better at big picture planning and policy making, while enciks generally at execution.End of the day, if the encik is a better person at planning, the team is better off with the encik planning, and maybe the officer better at man management, it would be better for the team to delegate based off of their strengths rather than ranks"
"Was there a formal exit interveiw done by SAF, or how it was conducted?"
"Everyone who leaves service will have a formal exit interview (same for all jobs I believe) where the boss will ask you about why you are leaving, any comments about the organisation, etc."
So did you get honest about that shitty boss? :)
"I was honest about him to my exit interviewer (who was the overall boss in our office). I was quite open about what I struggled with under him, and some of the unreasonable things he wanted of us and how it really made no sense, and I may or may not have used 'asshole' and 'prick' more than once in that conversation"
You didn't request to post out during the AFR period?
"Many factors in play which I don't really want to disclose, but believe me when I said that back then, I really exhausted all possible options"
Why did you leave and not extend your contract since you were already at a moderately high rank?
"I was on SAVER, so its not really considered a contract. To be fair, MAJ is not a high rank...haha.As for why I left, there were many factors. Long story short, had a pretty bad boss who made life VERY difficult for me, to the point where I became disillusioned with the work I was doing (got posted to a staff tour). That sucked, because I really loved being part of the SAF and working in an environment where I could impact lives...guess when I was in that staff job, he was quite a dick about things to the point where it really got to me...sigh."
"had a pretty bad boss who made life VERY difficult for me, to the point where I became disillusioned with the work I was doingYeah there's a saying - people quit bosses, not jobs."
Was your boss a scholar ?
He was a high flyer but not those president scholar/SAFOS type.
"Also, what are the job opportunities for ex-SAF regulars? (Were you an SAF scholar?)"
"Nope not a scholar, just had a local study award.Job opportunities it really depends on the people you know + how willing you are to just carpet bomb job applications. But if you have some skill sets (e.g. communications or security or logistics), getting a job is not that difficult."
"What are the career options leaving the force as a MAJ? It seems to me like a ""not here nor there"" kind of rank to leave the force. Your pay is relatively high but private corporations might not see your experience as relevant to their desired skillset. Most of my friends either leave at LTA/CPT or stay all the way till retirement."
"Actually that's very true. Most leave after their short contract as a CPT, so that they have enough runway to excel in their second career. For me, I left at the 'no man's land' stage cause I'm probably considered a little old to restart his career in the private sector, but I guess I'm grateful for my friend who extended the offer to me.I can't really recommend career options after you leave as a MAJ cause it's really depending on your background, what experience you have and your degree, etc. but all I know is it is significantly more difficult as compared to leaving earlier"
"Out of curiosity, can you share with us your educational background and how that affected your military career progression, and how it is impacting your current career progression?"
"If you could turn back time, would you have joined the army or would you join the corporate world?"
"If I could turn back time, I would probably have still joined the SAF and done everything I did up to the point where I was offered my last staff tour and said no :-)"
What education route did you take before signing on? Any advice for people that are keen to do so?
"I only decided to sign on after enlisting. I applied for a local study award and not the scholarships like SAS, SMS, etc. cause I knew my A levels were not good enough for those scholarships. Managed to snag a place in NTU after rounds of interviews.In terms of advice, I would say to really decide if the SAF is a viable career for you ONLY after commissioning. This is because what you see as a NSF is very different from what you see as a regular, and given that you have to deal with things like ranking, appraisal, etc., it will paint a very different picture.If you do decide to sign on, your education is really up to you on what you want to study, but be aware of the potential clauses (e.g. iirc if you study law, you cannot be called to the bar while you're a regular)."
How did your lifestyle change after leaving the force? Do you spend or save more? What are some bad habits you pick up in the army that carried over to your civilian life?
"My lifestyle did not really change, still more or less the same old me but without the uniform and regimentation. I definitely save less, because I can always save money from lunch by eating at cookhouse, and even if I go to the canteen the food is very cheap.Here in the CBD, I'm still working out where I can get cheap and value for money food.I think one bad habit I have is that I keep using SAF lingo, which my colleagues have pointed out to me hahaha. ""No one uses 'postulate' la"""
Hahaha civil service / SAF staffspeak deserves its own thread
"There was this CNA article not too long ago about jargon in the civil service, can't remember the title now but the author mentioned abut some jargon terms we always use :P"
"If you're around Raffles Place, can try the caifan at Interim food market. Rice, one veg, one egg, one meat for $2.70. Thanks for your service!"
Were you involved with any exercises involving foreign units and what were your impressions of them?
"Yes I was, both with Thailand and US armies. For the Thais, they are really good at what they do, and they are very CRAZY (snake's blood anyone?)For the americans...nothing to say about them. Like that lor...haha"
Hi! During your time in the SAF do you have any president scholars/high flyers as your boss? If so how are they in terms of working attitude? I really want to know if those “paper” general generalizations is real:
"My last boss (who was the shitty one that I've been alluding to in this thread) is not a president scholar or those very high flyer, but he was on a scholarship. In terms of working attitude he wasn't much of a people person but he drove the whole department to really work hard to move things (can't say too much because of opsec). That being said, I've had brief interactions with other high flyers (e.g. I shared about my exp with TCJ when I was in the tsunami relief efforts) and some of them are very nice and willing to get down and dirty with the men. Before he was CDF, Neo Kian Hong was at my camp for a function and I distinctly remember seeing him helping to serve food from the buffet line to some of the NSFs who were there"
What’s your vocation?
Infantry...Queen of the Battlefield!
"Respect.Infantry officers are the most xiong vocation, maybe just under field officers in commandos"
"Okay la, our brothers in khaki quite xiong also"
ADF?
"Er nope, I considered joining them though."
How is SAF regular pay like compared to the corporate world?And does each major earn the same? Or does it depend on your qualifications?
"I'm not sure about corporate world pay, but I know that the SAF pays a lot more than other ministries (I suspect it's because of the hidden intent to retain you as long as possible). The pay is quite good though...iron rice bowl so comfortable enough to have a family, etc.Not all majors earn the same pay. Quite a few factors go into pay which I'm not entirely sure of apart from the usual stuff like rank (MAJ 1 vs MAJ 2) or if you're a scholar, etc. I'm was a farmer so I'm guessing I'm at the lower end of the spectrum haha"
"I’m gonna be rude and ask, what’s your last drawn?"
"I prefer not so say, but around 7-8k range"
Bonus on average how many months? Got AWS?Does the 'farmer' term just refer to non-scholars?
"Yes the farmer term would be for non-scholars. Bonus on average would be the following stages:Mar/Apr - Depends on performance bonus, minimum 1 for baselineJune - Usual civil service wide 0.5 monthsDec - Usual civil service wide bonus (range depends on GDP) + 13th month bonus."
Ok! That’s more than sufficient to know!!
"What does it mean by ""I'm was a farmer""?. Stay low profile?"
"Basically means that I'm not a scholar, and so I have a steady and unaccelerated career progression"
Is there an age limit (official or unofficial) to signing on?
"There is a cutoff, but I'm really not sure of when that is. Maybe late 20s? But from what I know there's a new military experts scheme that allows for mid career transition."
How did all the unfit officer pass their IPPT? some are plus size and cant run properly but yet they can pass. How did this miracle happen in SAF?
"One requirement for regulars (other than clearing IPPT) is that we have to maintain a certain BMI too (if you failed BMI, then a fat % test) and if you don't clear those you'll be put on a weight management scheme designed to help you lose weight, and if you don't clear that you'll face consequences in career progression.But yes...there are some who cheat (anyone remember one incident in the past when the commandos cheated on IPPT records or something?)"
"In view of the decreasing TFR, do you think we should start prepping the citizens for the idea of enlistmenting females?"
"Wah to be honest I'm really clued in to those national policy type of discussions. As far as I know for enlisting females, why not? Israel can do it, I'm guessing so can we."
"Hello, I'm a female, enlisting in March! Do you have any advice for me (I'm quite shy 😅😅) so I can enjoy my army life?"
"First of all, congratulations and thank you for signing on, and willing to already go out of your comfort zone. To me that already makes you capable to beat any shyness or insecurities you have. My advice will be largely the same as what I shared with a question earlier on enlistment tips, but on top of that:Know why you wanted to sign on in the first place, and let that drive you to be the best you can be. Even if the reason is not as noble as ""I want to serve my country"", whatever motivation you hold onto is important to get you through difficult times especially during your first ever outfield.Don't let the fear of losing keep you from playing the game. You may not be as physically fit as the rest of your male companions, but that has never stopped female officers from striving hard, and some of them even performing better than their male counterparts. Above all, don't let fear chart your path, but let courage do so."
I'm sure you could tell when your guys are trying to Chao Geng and siam something. How was it having to manage all of that on a Regular basis? Haha.
"Haha, well its all about communication with your men, and this was something I told all my PCs and sect comds when I was an OC. Realistically, there is no rocket science to see who is trying to chao geng and who really is injured/sick (other than very obvious telltale signs)...so then it's up to the individual to assess. For me, I always gave the benefit of doubt, but I always instilled a sense of accountability with my men so that they know I'm not some tyrant trying to make life difficult for them, but more like a mentor who was willing to teach them life lessons.But I had my fair share of chao geng soldiers...I remember I sent home one guy who was claimed he was sick (was running a fever), but later in the day one of my PCs who was on leave spotted him playing LAN. Its tough when you have such bad eggs in your unit, because then it really spoils those who are genuinely sick."
Haha you sound like a really nice commander. Sorry to hear about the boss..
I liked my command tour but for a change of scenery (plus career progression) I took up a staff tour which had really good people as colleagues. Midway this guy came in and things went south fast.
"Since you had been in Army for some time, can you rmb a time when ties btw Malaysia and Singapore were so shaky? And what does poorer ties mean for the actual troops on the ground? More duties, more training etc?"
"Wah what a loaded question. Hmm...during the 80s when things were shaky during Mahathir's first reign as PM, my take is that diplomacy was difficult for us because of how he approached things (from what I read online).Some of you may know about the Pukul Habis incident in NDP 1991 when Malaysia and Indonesia had this joint paradrop exercise ON NDP DAY very near Singapore, and the SAF was mobilised that day. To be honest and real, we cannot take our peace for granted, because then we will become complacent and that's when our defence and deterrence will be compromised. If there was one good thing coming out of all the recent disputes between us and our neighbour, it becomes a clear example to teach soldiers that what they are doing everyday is real and important, and necessary for Singapore."
Which vocation is the best and why is it infantry?
The obvious MINDEF PC answer is that every vocation is a good vocation ;-)
"But okay la to be honest it really depends on your interest. I like talking and interacting with people so infantry was the best for me. If you're more of the technical kind of guy, engineers or signals might be more suited for you.In terms of career sign-ons, you have to think through what vocation you want to be in because it will affect your career progression. On one hand, there are tons of infantry positions and people so competition is there, but on the other hand, a smaller family like artillery has fewer positions available but also less competition, so you have to weigh the odds."
Just wondering. Did they (your current job) consider SAF as a valid working experience? Or did you start of ‘fresh’?
"For my current job it is somewhat relevant because I was exposed to working in a corporate management/top mangement job, so that counted as valid working experience. I cited an example of someone I knew who worked in PR in the SAF and then after he left he managed to get a job in a PR agency, so I'm guessing that counted as valid working experience too.It largely depends on what you did while in service, and so for career planning between you and AOMC/OPC they'll chart out a varied career so that you can remain relevant even in the situation where you leave service."
Do you think there’s a tekan culture in SAF where people who speak out are actively targeted with higher punishments or sai Kang?
"Hm, it very much depends on the person in question - I've had my fair share of troublesome soldiers who are very clearly speaking out just for the sake of being a nuisance and always arguing or disputing things. Similarly, I've had NSFs who have pointed out legitimate safety lapses or other grievances that the instructors oversaw, and I made it a point to address it. This whole tekan culture thing was probably a real thing in the past (and I tend to agree), but since then I sincerely think the SAF is trying its best to move away from it and empower more soldiers to contribute to ensure safety and improvements and not let rank dissuade them from doing so."
"were u from jc or poly, heard that they often like to choose jc students for ocs, btw is it true? If I were from poly, can I still make it to ocs?"
"I was from JC, but the belief you mentioned is definitely not true. There are tons of officers from poly and even some from ITE so its definitely false"
What's the time frame for a typical officer to reach MAJ rank? Realistically if you had stayed on till retirement what rank would you have reached?
"I think with a bit of luck and hard work I would have been LTC and that's really about it. Typical time frame largely depends on performance appraisal and also time and space, because when you're moving from CPT to MAJ there has to be a MAJ estab available somewhere first. Usually for farmers we get MAJ mid to late 30s, and those who excel get theirs earlier. That being said though, scholars are not confirmed on their progression. If you fuck it up along the way, it'll be reflected in your performance. From the grapevine, I've heard of scholars who did badly during tours and they end up hentak-kaki"
What's the good and bad about SAF?
Wow that's very broad. Any specific areas?
"In terms of the culture, office politics and are there some things ppl to climb the ladder?"
"Ah okay, well I guess that's also one thing that NSFs/NSmen don't understand from regulars (had one question like that somewhere). There are office politics, especially when ranking season comes around and people are vying for a good performance appraisal. From my experience, people don't really do very outright scummy things like intentionally sabo you but for some places, you do feel a sense of them sizing you up and that kind of unnerves me."
"Honestly, having read nearly all your comments and replies I just had to log in and say that I am heartened by the fact that there are military officers out there, despite being non-scholars, being fully committed to their job of protecting the country and are not just in it because of the typical misconception that ""regulars only sign on because they want money"" or ""they cannot get jobs outside"". This may be true for many initially when signing on, but I could tell that you've developed pride and passion with your career and see the greater picture of it, which is evident from how you could comment on a variety of issues in the force. Also really appreciate your honest, non-biased perspectives of looking at things without being salty, a mindset that I honestly find rare nowadays.It's a shame that you ran out of alternative options other than to quit the service. This raises a problem to fix - if the civil service wants to do well and retain good people, it should do better to not just retain those who are groomed for the upper management (i.e. scholars) but also make sure that the mid-level management are filled with passionate and talented individuals who can handle their job and not be forced out of it by the higher-flyers.Thank you for your service, Sir!"
How is yout resevrist obligations like? Do you have to start from 0? Like you have to complete 10 cycles till you're 55?Do they straight up ask you to become CO of a nsman unit?
"As far as I know, when you leave, you start from 0 and have to clock 10 cycles all the way till 55. If you leave service before 42, you are liable for ICT until 55. If you leave service after 42, no NS obligations."
Did you have to deal with any guailan NSF and how did you handle him
"Had two different extremes:The JC kid who thought he knew it all and always ask those bo liao stupid questions like questioning infantry tactics while in BMT, etc...I didn't handle him directly but one of my PCs kept complaining during meetings haha.Had one guy (can't remember his background) who was rude, always talked back and just was a general dickweed. He AWOLed more than once and I sent him to DB."
"Just curious, how does db works? Is your terms being passed on even after you ord?"
"Er, I'm not sure what you mean, but if you are asking if your DB sentence is reflected as a criminal sentence then no, it'll just be on your service transcript."
"Oicc, take awol for instance, how long would it be in db and heard they treat people like shit in db? Is that true?"
"How long your sentence is depends on your crime, I can't remember the punishment framework sorry. Treatment wise, I think given a choice I'd rather go to Changi than DB :-)"
"Thanks for sharing, why going to changi than db tho hahaha"
"From my limited experience, I think I believe the anecdotes that the treatment in DB is way tougher than Changi"
"Heh I can answer this based on past xp although of course things might have changed.In general, 1st time AWOL will be sentenced to DB half the days you actually AWOL-ed. 2nd time, it's 1 to 1. Then it scales.Treating inmates like shit is not true. It's just very strict so some inmates may feel it's bad (that's actually the point of being so strict, so inmates do not want to come back again)."
What are you working as now? :)
"Doing management consultancy, which is elaborate corporate speak for just meeting people over food and drinks and telling them what to do in their companies hehe"
"If you hadn't signed on, do you think you'd have been able to earn a similar salary in the private sector or even in other parts of the government?"
I shared somewhere here that the reason why I signed on was because of the very attractive pay at the time to support my family. I guess I would have been able to do the same in the private sector but I'm not too sure about the pay over 10+ years ago so I can't say for certain.
What was the most surprising event you had experienced when interacting with NSFs?
"Thats an interesting question - had to think about it so pardon the late reply. I've had many wonderful NSFs throughout the years so I can't really pinpoint the most but here are some distinct memories:Had an NSF who was some military fanatic, when we were teaching them basic fire movement and tactical movement, etc. he was chipping in with examples of how the Allies did some maneuver during WW2, etc, and he kept talking about movement tactics, etc.Mentioned this somewhere here, but I had an NSF who was outstandingly rude, bad attitude, all of that and AWOLed regularly too, had to send him to DB eventually. Why he was like that I still can never fully understand.I think in general I have had memorable NSFs, but what was most surprising was just the level of dedication they put into doing things, ESPECIALLY in unit life when we were undergoing ATEC."
"Signing on after undergrad studies is a no-no?I know, loaded question, just a messed up thought experiment with a lot of flawed assumptions."
"I had an NSF who ORDed, went to study in uni, and then signed on after that. So I guess it is possible, just that they would miss out on the benefits of things like study awards lor."
"I know that you're not the Army Recruitment Centre, but is signing on after uni an option only for commander-level rank holders, or as long as they like your resume and pass the interview, it is a possible career path? I suppose that if one were to sign on after uni, instead of getting the LSA/MDES ME4 equivalent, there is a sign-on bonus instead, and that Command School is not part of the Minimum Term of Engagement?"
"I can't really say for sure because I was never involved in recruitment, sorry! I only know that signing on after uni is not just for commanders, but for men its possible too. You can always call up ARC and find out more, they should be more helpful than me"
% of regulars who can contribute very well to SAF vs % of regulars who are only in it for pride or money?
"Hmm, I can't give you a percentage that I think is right, but I would say that if they were in it for the money to become filthy rich they are in the wrong job. Pride...I can't say but I guess there are people like that? I've met my fair share of them, some of them still in service. But there are people who contribute very well in the SAF, and I hope that that's the impression I gave to the people who worked with me."
"Are there forms of discrimination between the different branches of the SAF? Like any friendly/unfriendly competition between the Army, Navy and Air Force?Lots of my older relatives were saying, if managed to enter Air Force as a pilot during NSF, go and sign on, sure no regret.Navy = can consider as a viable career optionArmy = gone case, dun bother unless you really like to Chiong suaI guess there is a prestige factor of being able to join the Air Force as compared to the other branches"
"Haha of course, who doesn't want to be a pilot? :PBut really, there will always be competition whenever people have to choose between them, so theres no point in fighting it. But even if its a prestigious job but you hate it, there's no point taking it up because you'll just feel very disillusioned everyday.I don't have much close navy friends but I do have some air force kakis I meet every now and then...in my opinion, the pilots are a bit more arrogant la...the rest more grounded (pun intended)"
"As for your relatives who say that the army is a gone case, maybe you should let them watch series like Band of Brothers, Hacksaw Ridge, etc. The pilots may be the prestigious ones, but the ones in the trenches are the ones who forge a brotherhood that no one can really understand unless you've experienced it the same"
"Do you think the regulars value the NSFs and how would you think the general civilian population view the SAF regulars? If it’s negative, how do you deal with it?"
"My honest answer is yes, but it really depends on what function your NSFs play in relation to you. For example, in my unit as a junior officer then I was arrowed to organise a cohesion + BBQ, and my team comprised largely of NSFs so I really valued their commitment and effort to get it going even though it wasn't their main job per se. They actually get quite fair amount of things done really quickly and have good suggestions, so I really value them for that. In terms of training and unit life, I'm the kind of person that really is serious of the lives that is entrusted to me. I could very well just be a bo chup guy and push them past physical breaking point to achieve all IPPT golds in the unit, but I take the lives entrusted to me very seriously. I think general population has a mixed sentiment of regulars - both good and bad. For the negative, it's really hard to deal with it because they will always be bad eggs who rightfully deserve such perception, but ultimately it's up to the individual officer to make whatever reputation he wants people to have of him."
"Personally having been involved in both command and instructional roles (only as a spec), I'd like to know - what's your favourite tour; instructor or command?"
"I personally liked command tours because there's the opportunity to be with the men down on the ground, and to grind with them outfield and during ATEC. Not that I hated instruction tours but I feel I can't click as much with new BMT recruits as I can with second year soldiers."
"Are you jealous of the Armoured Infantry, who gets doesn't have to walk (too much) and can bring so much food outfield?"
"Yes to an extent, but when we see them cleaning the tank and we only need to clean our boots, it works out in the end :P"
"LOL, the people cleaning the vehicle are the vehicle crew, who do not have to walk at all. My aim is to never ever dismount and always to get back to camp with boots that are merely dusty, not muddy. :)"
What are some admirable qualities that you've seen in NSFs who were not commanders?
"Probably the best side I've seen of my NSFs was when the unit was prepping for ATEC - not just commanders but down to the very last man - everyone was committed to doing their best for the unit. When we achieved Redcon 2A, the celebration was unimaginable...it was then I saw that NSFs can be very committed in doing their best in their 2 years, which is really an opposite end of the spectrum from the chao keng cases we also see from time to time."
"For regulars who left the force, do you still have to go for ICT/IPPT?"
"IPPT yes, for ICT depends on what age you left the service. But we're liable until 55 (for officers)."
Does your teeth hurts when you bite cold ice cream?
Sensodyne helps :-)
thanks for answering a sensitive teeth question
"What would you recommend to a regular that wants to leave, in terms of finding another job outside?"
"Looking back now, you have to decide why you want to leave, and weigh the pros and cons. If you already have a job offer lined up, chances are you already want to leave so by all means go ahead. If your plan is to just go out and go fishing, you have to seriously consider things like if you have the finances to be jobless for a while, which can be critical especially if you have a family to feed like me. Also, you have to be clear on WHY you want to leave - is it just because you don't want to work in a uniform anymore, or is it because of people, or is it because of the organisation's direction not aligned with yours?"
How is your average work day like? Is it something like a 9-5 or do you stay in camp a lot? Is there a lot of paperwork you need to do when you're not conducting trainings?
"For my last staff tour it was usually a 8-6 kind, but my boss made things difficult and I found myself regularly clocking OT till 11plus, and also sometimes working on weekends (going to his house and huddling and doing work, can you imagine). While in unit it largely depends on the programme, but if its outfield I make it a policy to be with the men all the way. If its normal unit life I usually end my day by walking around the bunks and talking to my guys and then heading home"
What sort of line did you transition to? You mentioned meeting clients?
Management consultancy :-)
what is your take on regulars job being like any other in the civil service? should they be treated differently given the nature of the job?
"Yes and no in my opinion. Yes in that we are essentially like any other civil servant, serving our ministry and the people that are directly impacted. No in a sense that our roles are quite different than, say, a teacher. In our roles we have to be with men 24/7 at a stretch (eg outfield), we have a hanging duty to be recalled anytime, and other roles and responsibilities that other civil servants in deskbound jobs may not have. Not as though they are inferior in any way, but it's just that the nature is very different, and i would think along with it comes differences in treatment too"
"given the differences though, do you think the manner in which promotions and scholarships are awarded should be different. That is to say the current standard which is used is quite irrelevant for military purposes?"
"I would think so, but I really have not given much thought into this and I'm not experienced in this regard. What you are saying seems to make sense though. Sorry I can't be of more help on this"
"No need to disclose your pay of course, but I’m sure you had a pay cut/reduction from what you’re earning as a MAJ am I right? How do you deal with that?From what I know most regulars end up staying since they are already paid quite highly and can’t afford to find a job that pays a lot less."
"No worries, I mentioned somewhere here that my last drawn as a MAJ was about 7-8k. I did have a pay cut but it was not too bad, manageable since my wife is working too. Of course not everyone is like that, so you'll have to carefully map out your obligations (e.g. car, kids, etc.) with your new salary. Most outside jobs will pay less than a uniformed officer (the SAF really 'spoils' us this way), but I guess the extra money over civilian jobs is because of all the inconveniences you have with an SAF job, like being under OSA, liable for DB, have to do IPPT every year etc. Doesn't help too that camps are really far...when I was an OC in BMT I stayed near Toa Payoh."
"Is the tour randomize? Or is there a fix sequence that officer/specs have to go through? For example, my OC got posted to BMTC after he graduate from uni. After 2 years, he got posted to OCS. Isnt that both instructor tour?P.S for lousy grammar"
"It really depends on your interest (you can always sound out something you are keen on doing), time and space (openings) and of course suitability (e.g. they try not to put vocations like engineers or signals officers to be OCs of BMT tekong companies). There is a central unit that manages such affairs, but of course they'll try to make sure that every officer has a taste of each type of tour"
what a grave mistake
"I walked past this exact tarp like 6 times during my most recent ICT. the dudes always seemed to freeze when they saw us walking by, before seeming to relax and carry on with their work. Guess now i know why."

"Singapore is participating heavily in the 100 000 Asian genomes project. Some of the results of the SG10K project (10 000 Singaporean genomes) have been written up into a pre-print manuscript (not peer-reviewed yet), with about half of the target genomes done.Personally, I would be very wary of how my genetic information is handled. In these scientific studies, all the data is supposed to be de-identified, so it should be ok. But I certainly don't want the govt knowing my genetic info."
"Quite standard practice, basically 4G capacity very limited so if they sell unlimited, they cannot afford to have people use 200GB or 300GB every month. The ""unlimited"" advertising quite misleading in some cases. Hope 5G will solve this, heard it would have 1000 times the capacity."
"If true unlimited, these people will cancel their home internet and hotspot their phone to download shit and watch youtube at home.that's why people cant have nice things."
5G might still need quite time. There have been test conducted at some country and it have been reported that it had killed birds that flew by the effective range of the 5G test site

It just wasn't the same."

"A lot of young people dont seem to realise that in the good old days, esp 60s to 70s, the world was officially more conservative (in the press, laws etc) but unofficially, the people are more tolerant of liberal behaviour (sex, drugs etc). Now the laws are more liberal, but a sizeable population worldwide became a lot less tolerant and ironically think society's values has decayed over time.For example, divorce used to be a very shameful thing, but affairs, everybody was having it and everybody looked the other way. Now, there's no shame to divorce, but you are going to get more hate with having an affair."
"“the good old days” didn’t have people more tolerant of liberal behavior. “the good old days” were only “good” if you were lucky enough to be part of the privileged class, ie straight, male, and white (or chinese in the case of singapore).you think women in the 60s were out having affairs? hell no. they were too busy taking care of their children as they were expected to do. there were severe social penalties in going against your expected role in society.but to be a man, to be straight, to be of the majority ethnicity, and most especially, to be well-to-do? the world was your oyster.the world didn’t expect you to take care of your kid, that was woman’s work.if you had an affair with your secretary, that’s fine because boys will be boys.if you were caught with marijuana/crashed a car while drunk, it’s okay, daddy will take care of it.divorce was frowned upon precisely because of the above. a wife being capable of divorcing you means that you were a failure as a man because you couldn’t discipline your wife.society now is better because oppressed people have more agency and power not to put up with the bullshit of the majority. that is why affairs are less accepted now and divorce is more celebrated, because women are more respected."
thanks for debunking the fallacy! i really got confused there
Just because the beatles were singing about drugs doesn't mean the entire generation was (relatively) liberal. And your example doesn't make any sense at all
"Oh, the good old days where men could have all the affairs and multiple wives doing their bidding! How liberal! Doesn't it suck that when people have affairs now the partner can divorce and separate because they aren't married for their livelihood?"
"I think its just that now the sensitive people are given louder voices.The few who are over sensitive about everything from meat eating, guns to nudity etc are given easier access to shout loudly at the system.I mean, even Apple caved in to the sjws who called for the removal of the gun emoji. These days anyone with a sensitive view can just demand change."
"Thanks for this insightful comment, and thanks u/cdf too! You've both given me something to think about."
Oh is this why whatsapp randomly removed the gun emoji? Pfft
Some activists in the US claimed that having a gun emoji was arming everyone with a gun. So they demanded we 'disarm' our phones.Its bollocks. We cant just remove everything because someone somewhere is offended.
"The ""remove insignificant thing to make a message about another thing"" seems to be turning into a fad. The kfc straws also.I don't get what the gun emoji has to do with gun control in the US, but I guess it's not my problem. Still it's pretty stupid that a bomb emoji still exists but we now only have a water gun lul"
"If you follow whats happening in the US apparently now some trans people are demanding that straight people must find them sexually attractive or be labelled as homophobes.Also, some are pushing that they should be able to identify as non binary genders and that they should be given free pass to go into any gender bathrooms or events. A trans mtf even won a lawsuit suing the school for not allowing him/her into a womans bathroom.Even on other topics activists are getting louder every day. Look at the antivax movement. Its getting even larger even though its based on bullshit foundation.I know the US is a very far away place, but the general effects still will send ripples. If more kids are programmed by their parents to be antivax, gender nonconforming, anti-gun, anti-vulgarity etc etc soon we will see a paradigm shift from tolerance to abstinence. Everything will be censored and anyone who gets offended by anything will be able to ban others from even mentioning.Its a scary future and doesnt sound very plausible, but still its something to think about."

"My greatest sympathies with the victim in question, because there's absolutely no way this situation is going to become better if she continues staying there.Personal experience with confronting intentionally inconsiderate people who get a rise out of making the lives of others miserable, is that they just skirt the lines better within the confines of the law/rules."

It's 3D mapping the buildings for Google Maps and Earth. It's the right plane too. Disregard
That would explain low altitude and the straight lines! Cool stuff.
Wow..good to know!
Well shit. Makes me question more why Apple isn’t doing this? Their 3D list is so limited
Nah man the aircraft in the video is a King Air. The one out flying is a Cessna. But I agree it’s probably out doing mapping work or some sort of navaid calibration.
How odd. Wonder what is up with that. And normally don't small aircraft like that land at Seletar or Paya Lebar?
"If took off from Seletar, maybe something is wrong, or had to come back and is flying in circles to burn off fuel for a landing?"
"If I was a pilot, I'd circle the hell over Seletar airport if I had an emergency that required me to burn fuel before landing.Landing overweight beats ditching over water (this guy was making turns way out over the water past Changi) or looking for an empty space in the heartlands.Plus I wouldn't spend the effort flying such neat spacings between each pass..hahahaha"
Well I imagine the pilot is directed by ATC on routes and altitude.
"Iirc fuel burn circuit is over the water, you can’t do circuits indefinitely, which I assume is what you mean by circling over seletar."
"Is it still flying? I don't really know how to find that info on Flightradar, sorry :)"
"Nah, landed some time back already."
"Ohhh, thanks!"
"I think I saw it... I was at a kopitiam having dinner but happened to look into the sky and saw a pair of blue and red lights.

Maybe to allay fears from people like us.
Why r/softwaregore? This was a legit aircraft flight path.

Agree. Its just breeds more ignorance.
Reading racist bullshit everyday does not make you less ignorant. It does the opposite.
What's a hidden dragon?Agree with you about reddit. A liberal circlejerk land.
"Hidden dragons are basically high flyers or elites who slum it down in EDMW and intentionallly type in poor man's language. it's like emperors touring their slums undercover.That's why a lot of EDMW people learn not to judge how ""satki"" a person is from just grammar. Unlike SG reddit, which still harps on the superficial."
Lol yea I can see that being true. EDMW users somehow intentionally type poorly in some consistent fashion
I hope so....

Thanks alot bro! Will enjoy reading this.
Does this thread about fdw belong there?https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/asn59x/Full of ignorant people scolding other people ignorant.
"Truly shockedWelcome to the real world where on the outside the majority work on promoting racial harmony and diversity but deep down, what most can only managed is just that semblance of tolerance, and under the illusion of internet anonymity, many reveal their natural preferences to side their own and ostracize those that they feel are different.Also pretty sure there are many similar forums all over the world, even the great US and A.Stormfront is a white nationalist,[3] white supremacist,[4] antisemitic, Holocaust denial,[5][6][7] neo-Nazi[8] Internet forum, and the Web's first major racial hate site.[9] In addition to its promotion of Holocaust denial, Stormfront has increasingly become active in the propagation of Islamophobia.But unlike those who value 'Free Speech' over unnecessary discords and tensions, mods on edmw do their jobs with a level of competence. SG Laws and the likes, I reckon."
well now ur eyes r opened
"The natural state of the Internet is a toxic one and has been so for over 20 years at least. People just didn’t get as easily offended, probably because real life used to be more exciting, but I digress.This place is great because the downvote system has been effective in weeding assholes. But it still has its flaw: god forbid your opinions are against the juvenile majority here, even if they are logical."
"Maybe beneath the surface of racial harmony, there are still differences. Internet allow them to post behind the veil of autonomy. Just like two people talking politely in the public, in their hearts, they might have murdered each other a thousand times.If you look from another angle, its just people voicing their unhappiness. They have to vent it somewhere and some place."
"HWZ, Yahoo SG and many other forums - same. Ignore and thanks that the majority are unlike those. Atleast outwards."
"EDMW is where people go to troll, mess around, and generally let out the skeletons in their closets. Don’t take the things there seriously. It’s like 4chan."
"That’s the perspective I’ve learnt to take. To be honest, once I started to check the forums out and take everything with a pinch of salt, it gets better.I tried out interesting food recommendations from the forum and learnt about news earlier than newspapers (it’s so meta). As for the rest, I think everything is satire, trolls and a joke."
U PC BRO? I'M PC TOO!
"People thought the ""PC"" in the PC Forum means ""politically correct."" :P"
hardwarezone is like the 4chan of singapore tbh.
It's EDMW man.
"nah its all the same people, facebook comments, youtube comments, hwz, edmw and even reddit. its all your fellow neighbours letting loose their inner voice. you shouldnt be shocked about the nature of people here"
"Let there be a platform for those people. Last thing i need is for them to come here, if and when HWZ gets shut down."
"I find it hilarious that you can't cuss over there, but all the racist, sexist and xenophobic stuff are totally OK!"
"To be fair it's only EDMW, but yeah, there are people who are like that there.Anyway, if you can and are willing to ignore the those stuff, there are gems especially about latest deals/offers etc"
Every city has an underbelly. C'est la vie.
"Me being a malay/muslim, we try to ignore or brush it off all the negative comments but then again we do need to educate these people. What doesn't kill us makes us stronger??"

"Can someone enlighten me? Huang Na is a hokkien term for Malay right? As a Chinese, I don't see an issue being called Cina.Agree with the rest tho"
Is it an actual phrase? Never head of it.THis is the only Huang Na I know of. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Huang_Na
"From my understanding, its a hokkien term. So it's not racist in my eyes."
That's mandarin/beijing dialect. The hokkien term for Malay is Huang Na.
What about Tekong?
OP thought it was the sun and cropped it out
Have what? You can see Tekong highway is quite lit ... probably from route marches.. hahah
Strava not allowed.
"Looks accurate, loads of people running around marina bay and across the barrage.Didn’t a whole bunch of “secret” US military bases get discovered because the soldiers were GPS logging their training runs with this kind of thing?"
Yessir
"Strava is a running/cycling app where you actively turn on and off tracking to capture your route and metrics, so it should only be representing running/cycling activity instead of just where Singaporeans are. Do you recognize any roads that you run/bike along? :)"
Running on water between Johor and Changi 🤔.More Jesus in action in Penang.
"On a serious note, those are probably caused by people not turning off tracking while on boats."
I doubt any if it is really that accurate... You can't run on highways....
So many of the army camps are lit af. Hahah. I can see the exact route I ran every day in PLC. And so may other camps are obviously lit up. RIP OP-SEC
You can clearly see the 2.4 route .. hahah
"But seriously, Singaporean don't care for opsec..."
MINDEF WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
Who the hell is running through Lim Chu Kang?
"""training to be soldiers! Running for our life! Black bag over our head!"""
With Strava on? Lol.
Isn't it mostly linked to people's smartwatches?
Cyclists. LCK is a popular road to cycle on.
In Bintan all the roads which I know don’t have a pedestrian walkway are also lit AF...cyclists?
The Gedong 3km route FeelsBadMan
"$3,200 fine or 16 days' jail.Even ignoring the particular circumstances here, wouldn't most Singaporeans (for whom a day is not worth $200) choose the 16 days' jail?"
"Must see whether fine will have record anot. If no, then not worth to jail since it affect future job career. If yes, then yes worth"
"It doesn't make a huge difference since most application forms ask if you have ever been convicted of any criminal offence before, rather than whether you have been sent to prison before, so you'll have to answer 'yes' either way."
"He might even argue that's a strength as it shows he's not afraid to speak up to issues. Especially when applying for global companies. They seek people who are not afraid to speak up to issues. All the more his offence is publicised in the news so if the employer knows about the type of offence is minor compared to a more criminal form of offence like rape, robbery or murder."
"Right because global MNCs want to hire people who are fearless about exposing wrongdoing, and reckless enough to do so in an illegal way. Care to share what you’re smoking?EDIT: Good Lord are people seriously agreeing with the above poster that hardcore anti-establishment activism is a trait that is sought after by global MNCs?"
Illegal only in Singapore. Not the rest of the world. Im just stating my opinion. No need to get all worked up over it.Don't forget Reuters did it too. https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/picture-reuters-journalists-protest-here-catch-attention-police
"I shouldn’t have been so harsh I agree. But most MNCs in any part of the world would be cautious about this type of people who fearlessly militate for what is right without discretion tbh. There’s a reason why so many MNCs are known to clamp down on whistleblowers, despite claiming in public to be committed to transparency.EDIT: What the Reuters reporters did was quite different, and probably with the tacit pre-approval of their superiors (since their APHQ backed the protesters up). Do you seriously think any major company will back an employee who did what Jolavam did?"
I disagree. Lately MNCs are changing their work cultures to include the rise of whistle-blowers in social media age. Most of these falls under Ethics and Compliance given the many cases of corruption. Companies are educating their workers on how to react and how to report these incidences through the proper channel. So it's like whistle blowing but only limited to the company instead of public disclosure.
"You're partially correct - MNCs do want employees who are outspoken enough to voice out misconduct or inefficient practices via the right internal channels. However, MNCs also want employees to have the discretion to know which channels are appropriate to report which issues (rather than broadcasting it to the whole world like what Jolovan is doing here), as well as which issues the company wants reported and which issues the company prefers to remain willfully blind to.There is also a principal-agent issue - the top executives of the MNC may encourage employees to whistleblow internally, but the mid-level management would want their subordinates to remain quiet to keep the department peaceful and avoid oversight from upstairs. Someone who whistleblows too much is likely to tread on the wrong toes above him, and is unlikely to last long in a corporate environment.Source: Spent too much time watching SAF regular office politics :/"
Sinkie are made for middle management.
"You're misunderstanding me; I'm not saying that whistleblowing is a bad thing, but I'm saying that even in MNCs that purportedly promote transparency, there are tangible and intangible consequences in doing so which a pragmatic person must consider. It's a rare company that rewards its employees for moral courage."
Lol you need to not take things at face value.
"Does it make a difference whether one chooses to pay the fine or go to jail? Either way, hasn't one already been convicted of crime X?It would be weird if it made a difference."
Iirc some questionnaires ask if “you have ever been incarcerated” instead of if you have ever been convicted so in those situations a fine instead of a jail term would make a huge difference
"No, is whether you are convicted, they don’t care whether you are incarcerated or not.Source: I have a friend who got fined for road rage. Lost his job and a few interviews didn’t go through because of the road rage."
Im not sure too haha
"There's a much greater social stigma attached to going to prison though. If you tell people you got fined people will think its probably something minor like speeding, but step into prison for a single day and judgmental people will treat you with revulsion.Singaporeans love their 'face', and for most of us $200 a day is a small price to pay for this. But Jolovan is trying to depict himself as a victim of political persecution IMO, so getting thrown into prison furthers his goals much better than simply getting fined."
""

"Quite sure the median salary in sg is above $4400 (22 weekdays*$200).Even for those who don't, one day in jail isnt the same as one day of work."
its symbolic
Jail isn't a fun place to be at all (surprising). It way more than just having your income cut for 16 days. I think anyone who can afford the money will do it even if their day isn't worth $200.
Signing only things he had a copy of seems like a great idea lol. Why can’t the police furnish him with a copy of his own statement? He would have gladly signed it then.Sounds like the mata didn’t want to be seen giving in to his request so they opted to make him sign through threats of an additional charge
It’s easier for collaborators to coordinate their fabricated evidence if you let them take a copy.Can’t imagine why not signing your statement is considered an offence though.
"But witness tampering is already a crime lol, so the accuracy of the collaboration is sort of an irrelevant point... maybe can compromise by letting the lawyers hold it instead?I think not signing is an obstruction of justice type of thing but ianal. Iirc in s’pore you don’t have the right to remain silent, and they often insist you give a statement before letting you see your lawyer"
I guess it’s may be because a statement can be used as an official court document on what your testimony on a case is.Refusing to sign it is like saying “I would like to give this testimony but I don’t want to officially indicate that I said these things”
There are policy reasons against giving a witness a copy of their statement.This is not unique to Singapore: https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/witness-statements-and-memory-refreshing

"My O-Level Grades are:English - A1Pure History - B4Combined Humans - C5Mathematics - E8Combined Science - E8L1R4: 23With that E8 on my math, I don't meet the JAE entry requirements for any poly courses.I've applied to ITE and got accepted into a course by now, but withdrawal is still an option.I've been thinking of going down to RP to appeal into their common business course, but both my parents advised against it (they think since I failed both math and science terribly there's no point in going down and I'd just embarrass myself by going down there to appeal, so I didn't when I could have went down myself weeks ago and now I'm really regretting not doing just that, and now? I don't even know if it's possible anymore. Is it too late?"
"Well, you miss all the shots you don't take. But then again, don't have high expectation of getting in.And r/sgexam"
"You remind me of my friend.Decent grades all around, but cannot do math at all.He went to ITE, then poly, then SIM. It's a roundabout path, but you'll get there."
"bro, A1 for english isn't decent, that's actually amazing but i get your point"
Damn i got a 8 for both math and sci as well. Did well for eng and humanities. Retake those 2 subjects as private candidate. That’s what i did.
Just try lor no harm done trying
u can try appealing for RP.. and say u will retake math the following year and they'll take u in for those 24-26pt courses.
My Friend gotten F9 for his o’lvl maths but still manage to get into rp sports course. Why not give it a shot go appeal for it
"Brah, just self study / go tuition for your maths and science and retake it as a private candidate. Then apply for poly again next year."
"You should definitely try appealing, but maybe also figure out what kind of courses you want to appeal for?It's not impossible to appeal into a course in an unconventional way: I did that when I graduated from secondary school (this was 10 years ago but still). There was only one course I wanted, so I didn't give up on it.Don't remember what my exact grades were... but it wasn't good. I emailed the course manager and called them and did anything and everything just for an interview to have a chance to get in.It took 6 weeks after I sent that initial email, a few rejections since I didn't do it by the book, but I got an interview. I brought my portfolio and showed what I can do, and what I want to do after Poly.I did it in the end. My course accepted me, and it was the best 3 years of my life so far. I made great friends and had supportive lecturers whom I can count on till this day."
"You remind me a bit of myself, I also failed E maths at O lvls and got distinction for English. What I did was apply to TP mass comm through JPSAE. It's been years, and I don't recall the deadlines for applications anymore, but with your English score, perhaps you can try appealing for courses that are more language focused.Of course, depends on what course you want in the end. I had a senior who also failed her emaths, and ended up retaking as a private candidate and ended up getting into NP mass comm instead of taking higher NITEC. I wasn't confident in my ability to get a better grade since maths has always been my weak point so JPSAE was a godsend.Tbh, just appeal as much as possible if you have a portfolio. Better to try and possibly fail than not try and definitely fail."
"I beg to differ, managed to get into NP smoothly with EAE"
Based on my class alone (im from nitec btw) around 1/3 of my class went to poly
Retake will be a better option. It's only an extra year compared to going to ITE. Much more variables and years.
"Good looks? I actually thought it was the other dude, then it was the manbun guy then Huh? Odd title"
"The fish soup from this store is amazing but can be pricey for some. I recommend trying their batang soup or more expensive but softer textured promfret fish soup.However, try not to come after 2, as they can run of fishes quite early and close every Monday."
Good job. Hope they are given a couple of days off.
half day at most LMAO

"was mentioning about this to my friends today. bummer that it's not in all theaters tho. would still catch it in the weekend, cheers!"
Yeah its quite unfortunate that this happens to local films which are not produced by certain groups.Hope that it changes soon =)
Going to watch it tomorrow! Will update my thoughts here again.
"Thank you in advance for your support in watching the film!It has won a number of awards, the most prestigious being the Locarno International Film Festival.Please do go check it out in the cinemas soon!"
Ooo I saw a crowd outside the Cathay on Tuesday night around 9pm for this show I believe. Was it like a meet the cast session?Good luck to your friend's film! Looked like it was popular amongst the 20+ years old peeps.
"That was actually the gala premiere! It was only for cast, crew, family, media and press."
"I had an unexpected wholesome experience at the KFC at the old Woodlands Centre (next to the Malaysian customs checkpoint). It was 15 years or so ago. My buddies were regulars at the place and were friendly with one of the aunties. I followed them there one time and the aunty was all smiles and making conversation. She disappeared and returned with some chicken and a LARGE cup of coke for me. I asked her why I'm the only one who got a drink and she replied with the biggest most heartwarming smile:""Big boys like you need MORE energy!""Thanks KFC aunty <3"
Was KFC selling Coke instead of Pepsi 15 years ago
"Boy ah, I tell you ah, old man like me, cok or pehsi all same ok."
"""Big boys like you need MORE energy!"" OH WHAO , i literally think of.... lol.."

He has been doing this for years I used to go there to study in 2016
He will also wish you good luck before exams! U will feel so warm inside when u receive his notes!
"Oh friendly Uncle Philip's still working there! I received it 2 years ago, kept it as my good luck charm throughout my stay in NTU haha."
Does he write this for everyone or is it selective ? So sweet of him
Man i miss uncle philip :(
"my friends surprised me for my birthday at KFC once, and I guess some of the kfc staff heard so they gave me a free froyo and a handwritten “happy birthday!” note on a pink post it note just like that. It was cute af and I still have that post it note today :)"
So heartwarming
Colonel Sanders approves.
I got one from a very nice lady cashier too! Gave it to my mom and it made both our days ☺️
Reinforces my believe that KFC>> McD
I got nice handwritten notes with nice quotes too from the KFC in Bukit Batok
You must be cute
"That's a pretty nice note!Anyways, what are your thoughts on the new burger? I feel like it was a weird version of a double down. But still good."

Ahh the mac and cheese bun nassssty
I like it.
ok leh reminds me of the mozzarella one but this one doesn’t really have a mac n cheese taste to it
Fried chicken and good health ?I think /S missing in that note

You’ll need good health wishes if you keep eating at KFC 😊
But ntu kfc quality sucks...
Wishes you good health meanwhile selling you stuff bad for you.

"I'll try to keep this short.Last time i went to asia (i'm from europe), i got really sick only two days into my trip. We quickly concluded that it was food hygiene that got me sick, since i was the only one who ordered from a specific food booth and all my mates were fine while i was laying back at the hotel sick. This time im going to Singapore, and even though i'm pretty sure it will be okay i'm still worried.So is there anything i should be worried about? Are there some repercussions i should take and most importantly is food court food safe to eat?"
no
"No, not a concern at all!:)"
no
"Singapore's food is mostly safe, but as with traveling overseas you should always bring along activated charcoal in case you do get food poisoning anyway."
"Activated carbonActivated carbon, also called activated charcoal, is a form of carbon processed to have small, low-volume pores that increase the surface area available for adsorption or chemical reactions. Activated is sometimes substituted with active.Due to its high degree of microporosity, one gram of activated carbon has a surface area in excess of 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) as determined by gas adsorption. An activation level sufficient for useful application may be obtained solely from high surface area.[ ^PM | Exclude ^me | Exclude from ^subreddit | FAQ / ^Information | ^Source ] Downvote to remove | v0.28"
"No. Singapore has decent food hygiene. But if you really want to be on the safe side, eat at restaurants with grade A or B (it will be displayed in the restaurant/food stall in hawker centres). You will be fine, no worries."
In general no
"Singapore is way cleaner than the rest of SE. Asia, and is the only country in the region where tap water meets WHO standards.. have no fear here. Each food stall will have a sign with its cleanliness rating. A and B ratings are fine."
No unless your body doesn't really agree with asian food I guess. Btw not trying to be pedantic but you meant precautions and not repercussions
You kidding? Europe has shittier food hygiene than over here.
You eat mcspicy confirm diarrhoea but that’s not cause of food poisoning
Not much for you to be worried about. If you want to play safe you can check the hygiene rating of the individual stalls (they r required by law to display it). Any stall with at least a B rating should be safe enough.
"No, we take food hygiene seriously here and we even have a government agency that monitor food hygiene here. Hawkers here have to publicly display their hygiene grade.So unless you have a sensitive tummy, you should eat to your heart's desire here. Here some food places you should check out."
just be prepared to fight off birds while eating at the hawker centres
You can drink directly from any of Singapore's hotel tap water too. Totally safe.
"yes you should be fine, singapore is not like other asian countries. if you're too worried make sure to look at the food certificate at restaurants and food courts, it should be pasted near the entrance / somewhere visible. If it's A or B it should be ok."
Nope
It’s rather rare for anybody to get food poisoning in Singapore. There have been recent cases of food poisoning but they’re offshoots.
Nah
wtf?
"Yeah - such innovation; see Uber, copy Uber."

"Hello r/Singapore . I know r/SGExams exists but I want to get some input from people who have already finish with their sg schooling.So I didn't get into the polytechnic course of my choice, and even after appealing I didn't get in. I got 15 points and some of the courses I applied and appealed for are 21 and 26 pointers so it doesn't make sense to me that I didn't get it. Anyways, now I have a few options of what to do.Work this year and apply for polytechnic through EAE or DAEEnlist for early NSGo ITEI'm really not sure as to what to do now. I have a job at challenger and I'm happy with the income that I'm making so there's that much but apart from that I'm lost. Thanks for the inputs and help in advanceEdit: Got a b3 for everything"
Wew 15 points still can't get in? My how much have the times changed. Just go for early NS in that case that after that either go do Poly again or Try ITE.
Read his previous posts. Most likely he has been trying his luck to apply courses where COP < his score. Tough luck 🤷
"Yeah, his post title piqued my interest, and the text-post sounded not quite right with L1B4 15 not being able to enter Poly.OP's posts on /r/SGExams made it clear that he is only interested in business courses and nothing else.He was also currently offered a course in RP for ""some fuck all course called sports management"" (his words).Dude also thinks that RP is ""wayyyy too far for [him] bc it's the other side of the island"" but SP is okay when he ""live in the south east"". The sense of entitlement really put me off, but if OP values commute time more than an education then that's his choice.Unless OP tells us what the 21/26 pointer courses that he applied for but was rejected, I don't know if anyone can give any solid advice. This is not a case of having nowhere to go, and more like wanting to go to medical or law school but having subpar results to me."
Wow I just read his other post and it does sound really entitled lolJust do the course op having a diploma is better than having nothing.
"I feel bad about basically dabbing on a naive 16-year old on the internet, but there obviously was a series of mistakes made as well as a weird mindset behind the choices made.OP's now considering ITE/Kaplan/NS?Maybe I'm old or the way of thinking has changed, but I don't get the fixation on 'Business or nuffin' mindset, especially since the skillset from business schools are more general (like, it's easier to teach yourself a marketing or finance module than etymology or cosmology), but I may be biased as someone who chose the STEM fields."
"In RP, there is a Business IT diploma course with the COP of 26! Looking at the course structure, it has so many businesses modules. OP should have made an informed decision.My o levels score was 26(Just barely made it). Went to study IT in RP, worked my ass off and was valedictorian. Did comp sci in NUS and now working as a software engineer.So OP, don't take the easy way out man."
"If you live in southeast, Woodlands is nearer than Dover..."
"I really think OP worded his post inaccurately, based on his previous comments. Firstly, he could not get into any course amongst his original 12 choices in the JAE.One who falls into this situation can apply for a JAE-Appeal, where one is given an additional six course choices to choose from. Obviously if you are under Appeal, your choices take less precedence than someone else still in the original JAE stage, even if your o-level score is better than his.His rant about being overqualified for yet not getting into ""21 and 26-pointers"" are probably courses he chose on Appeal"
Then he should've though about his original 12 choices a bit more thoroughly.
""
This is what happen when you bite off more than you can chew. You have 12 choices to fill in and you fill in courses that you dont even qualify. If u have filled in a 26points course in your 11th or 12th choice you would have already gotten yourself a space.
tbh i didnt know about this system also....does it apply for psle too?i better becareful too
"If you are referring to the application for secondary schools, yes it's the same way.Students with the highest PSLE score get slotted into his first choice, followed by students with the next highest PSLE score and so on. If the student's first choice school is full already, then he gets slotted into his second choice and so on."
thank you!
Back in the day when I was applying for polytechnic courses I only put in 4 choices. I knew that I would get into my fourth choice. the person accepting my application was so worried for me that he kept suggesting courses for me to include. I added one more course just to make him happy.The results came out and I got into my fourth course.
""
"First off OP, stop being so entitled. There are perfectly acceptable reasons to not want to go to RP, such as not being able to enter local universities but location and travel time IS NOT one of them.One lesson from this is that you've made your bed by selecting courses that you are not eligible for, so now you need to start considering what's going to happen if you aren't accepted into NP/SP.With all that said and done, you're young and stupid. We've all made bad decisions at that age so now you have the following options:Take the RP course, lan lan suck thumbPersonally go down to NP/SP and talk to the dean/principal of the school. (It is imperative that you go down personally and explain your situation and beg for a slot in a course that you qualify for. Don't be an idiot and beg to be accepted into a business course that you don't qualify for or ask your parents to write a letter to MP.)Write in to MP (Super unlikely to work)Wait 1 year and retake 'O' levels then apply againEnter NS early (This is a terrible idea don't do it)"
"As an RP student, it isnt even that hard to go local uni after u grad lol. My cousin was from RP and she's in SIM now i think"
Did you cousin enter SIM GE? Cos that isn't a local uni. Unless you're talking about SUSS but I'm not sure if they accept students from RP. I know for certain that NTU and NUS do not accept students from RP and it's super unlikely to get into SMU
It's not SIM GE lol but im also not v clear what exactly she got into
"With your score you should go poly instead of ite.If the waiting period is too long, u may consider ns first, then during that period apply for poly."
Smlj? 15 points is not bad Le wo. Write to MP and ask? Its quite ridiculous that your score cannot go into 21 or 26 point course
He's exaggerating. He means that the course includes EAE kids who scored 20+ points but alr secured their placing. However the JAE COP is still pretty low for the course and thats why he can't get in.
Ohh ic... thanks for providing clarification. Cause to me it seemed quite odd why his grades could not make it for a course which had such a high COP
Which course are you looking at where you can't even get in with a 15 points? it is due to the math/english requirement?
"Your points do not matter as long u meet the cut off points for the poly course, if the course is full they will not accept u in regardless of ur points, perhaps thats why your appeal was unsuccessful."
Course shouldn’t be full leh. 26 points course should prioritize his 15 points first what.
Probably filled up all 12 choices with lower cutoffs hoping to get in via appeal if/when all 12 failed. Can't fault the system.
Ohhhhhh. Maybe that’s it. I took a gamble and went Poly - JC - JC - JCIf I didn’t get into the poly I wouldn’t have gotten anywhere pbb
26 points course was prob full. They cant just kick out a 26 pointer to allow a 15 pter to enter as it wouldnt be fair. If there was a vacant space then he would be accepted
"Highly unlikely that 15 pts wont get into a 26 point course. Not exactly sure how you should approach this... But several ppl suggested taking O Lvls as a priv candidate in army. Srsly no. In the army, your free time is limited and you would probably use it to surf reddit etc. There simply is no motivation to study."
what courses are you aiming for? and what course are you given now?
You can try dae. But you'll be competing against a wider pool of applicants. Also need to see if there are any vacancies left for the course.
What the.... i thought 15 points is JC territory?
l1r4 and l1r5 got diff hor

"Depending on how much you're willing to put in work, I'd suggest enlisting early.You can retake your o-levels (or even a-levels) while in the army as a private candidate, or just apply a few more times with your current results.Whatever you do, do not apply for a course you're not interested in. You'll likely regret that decision for life.All the best dude."
Ur English grade? Go for poly..
"Enlist early ,apply againYour ns can be disrupted"
"It happened to me b4. I worked part time for a few months and retook some olevel subjects to improve my score. Manage to get in the following year. (21) But wasted a year lar. If you want to become spec/officer in ns, you will need to own at least a diploma. Else I would suggest you enlist while you are still young. You can spent the next 2 yrs making friends and think where you want to go next. Your officer and specs can give you some insights as they just graduated from school as well. Your score is pretty good btw."
good post. though I would NOT call that a waste year at all since you used it well and reached your goal.
"It's great you're thinking about this and seeking opinions. You should share the name of the course, maybe others can help.Is repeating not an option?#3 is 100% out of the question, it only makes it harder for you.Do you have a course you really want to get it? Or do you have a few in mind?If you know the field you want to make your career out of now, then don't sway. Do whatever it takes to get into that field of study.Do you plan to go uni? This affects how many courses in Poly you can consider. If poly is at this point the highest level you intend to complete then do anything required to get in.I think if you choose to work, you should work in the field you're interested in. Say you're interested in aerospace engineering, go work in engineering (engineering capacity) or an aerospace company (even if it's just admin). Then you'll be able to get contacts related to/ within the field you want. You're young and unless in dire need of money, you should aim for a job that helps you get nearer your future career.If you've always wanted to try some working in a certain field (e.g. barista) that isn't related to your future career, that's perfectly fine too, though possibly not optimal, at least it's something you've wanted to do (a goal).fyi poly was a long time ago for me. don't know what's EAE or DAE."
"I'm currently interested in business, and work as a salesman at challenger, so I guess they are somewhat related. I do intend to go to university but not in singapore, most likely in Australia. The course given to me was sports management, a 26 point course, but I got 15 points, and I applied for business in tp, np and sp, got the worst and least business-like course in the least convenient school for me, and apparently rp is the worst poly as well so I'm super bummed :("
"You current job is related to your field of interest, so well done there :)You do know Business is quite a general topic. You don't need to study business to be in the business field. In fact business you don't need any education past maths if you've got good business sense & good soft skills.At this juncture might be helpful to distinguish between wanting to be in (a) Business (start your own company) or be in (b) business development or sales (employee first route which is safer). Bear in mind neither route is cast in stone.For (a) you just need alot of hussle, drive and ability to motivate & convince people. Contacts, relationship building etc. And be relatively comfortable with uncertainly.For (b) a good education qualification in any field (sports management might not be the best but if you do very well (top 5-10%), it still can be useful. however if you hate the topic, unlikely you'd do well.) If some guy with top 5% diploma in Sports management came to an interview vs 5 other people who have Cs and Bs in business, he likely would win if he does well in the interview. People want to hire people they can work with, not just the most academic (unless you're talking civil service LOL)1 thing I have to state, I believe Singapore education system tries to stream people into areas they think they require manpower, but they don't consider your true well-being. I always like to point to all the bio-med grads and how that industry turned out. Think for yourself is the #1 rule, the govt doesn't think for you, it thinks for its own best interests. Our education system is not structured to build business people. Second chances are few & far between in sg edu system. Business is the complete opposite.Think of education as a way to build yourself up. The academic things you learn are but a small portion of the whole. The of learning how to learn/master a subject, pushing yourself to be better, making friends, being able to work well in a team in both leader & teammate roles, safe environment to do trial & error and also find out more about yourself and your goals / dreams.The job market now is open to the entire world. So if you want to do well in this global marketplace, you either need to have a passion for it or have a passion to do very well in whatever you do. Your education is not just for working in Singapore, being able to work overseas brings many benefits and more opportunities. I know many who graduate overseas, work there first and return to Singapore at a better pay grade & position than those who don't have overseas work experience.Alot of the time, having some technical background is very useful for business. I have a friend doing business development (sales & marketing) in semi-conductor field. Very good at his job, it requires engineering qualification. His has a great business mind. He always thinks of being his own boss, but he's probably got too much to lose now if he quits. Compare him with Elon Musk, engineering background, builds billion $ companies, but has high risk appetite and possibly not driven by money but achievement.If you wanna start a tech company for eg, it's very useful especially in the early days to have the technical know how yourself in order to cut costs (your pay = zero) and also so that you can evaluate those you hire to do certain jobs (avoid getting smoked). But this is not mandatory, especially if you have the charisma to attract investor $.There are many current business owners who worked for a big company then left to start their own business to compete or become a vendor/supplier to that said big company.Access your strengths and weaknesses (these change over time). Then see how they affect what course you should take. If you're introvert, sales & marketing likely isn't your thing.I'm a strong believer in repeating a year if you know the course you want, if you realise how much more work is required and you know you have potential to do much better.*edit* If you're likely headed to Australia, look into possibility of doing pre-university college course there. I remember Trinity college feeds into melbourne uni."
"would like to address the part about worse poly etc. Malcolm Gladwell often shares this interesting idea (youtube talks & interviews). He never got into an Ivy league college and felt that his time in a less competitive university actually helped him. He managed to excel at a lesser known uni and this boosted his confidence in himself. It has an amount of wisdom. It's like if I somehow got into RJC but know I'd be the worst student there. Better be top student in JJC than bottom in RJC, because JC is not the end of the academic line nor life.Take a longer timeline view. You're currently only looking 1 step ahead. You said Oz uni is affordable. RP being not the most prestigious? In reality, no-one cares which poly you graduated from. top 10% in RP is more impressive than being average in SP. Though do make sure whichever poly & course you take is recognised by oz Unis should you wish to be granted credits.I understand your being bummed out, its a product of being in the Singapore's system. Can't fail mentality. Don't fall down. This is only accurate if you wanna be a scholar and enter civil service.You've heard it before - Succeeding in life is not about how you avoid falling down but how you get up after each fall.So right now, getting into RP might seem as a failure/fall. This is your chance to learn how to get up."
I'm sorry but... have you looked at the modules in sports management? there are a lot of modules that are related to business
"just finished my 3yrs in NP MCM on tuesday goodluck with your appeal journey, just saying chances of a successful appeal after the jae appeal is even lower but not unheard ofif you do get into poly, pro tip, work on that attitude of yours. being entitled wont get u anywhere in the business course, thats where everyone is competitive af and willing to do dirty work for that extra edgenonetheless GL"
"I suggest you appeal directly to the school. But as I said, if you want to study business, sports management is not bad alr, study hard and get a good GPA so u can study business in uniyou can work and retake a few subjects to improve your scoreyou will start as a man and have to grind to wospecdon't do it"

enlist into Army.your sense of entitlement is outstanding ~ go use the 2 years to grow up.
What course are you aiming for? It doesn’t make sense for you to enlist now considering you could easily enter half of all the poly course with 15 for “O”. Could you be more specific?
"I got like 25 pts for O's and appealed into rp just fine, I even failed math which was a yikes. Though the courses they gave me were pretty meh"
"I have an experiences talking to MP.didn't quite help.Going early into NS is an option.Choose this if you already had a vision to do what after NS.Considering you want that course badly,you can retake the exam using private institute(i retake my N Level using private institute).You can also work 1st,in any field while earning & learning work skills.Sometimes these certificates are pretty non existent.So it ok if you don't get your ideal job."
"I got 15 points and some of the courses I applied and appealed for are 21 and 26 pointers so it doesn't make sense to me that I didn't get itThere is a big difference between courses you originally applied for in the JAE, and those you applied for on appeal because you couldnt get into any amongst your original 12 choices. You are naturally given lower priority for courses you appealed for"
"I didn't get into the course of my choice at first too. In fact, I also got rejected for all of my 12 choices with 15/16 points (I don't remember which it was... this is 10 years ago), and they put me in an engineering course in NYP. I would have not done well in engineering.But I was stubborn and I appealed directly to the course manager. I found out who was in charge, emailed and called them, and asked for an interview. (I read in the comments that some people say to appeal to your MP... I'm not too sure if that's the right route 'cause they don't have a direct stake in the course/school.)Why an Interview?An interview was ""low stakes"" for them 'cause they didn't have to immediately accept me, but it's perfect for showing what was good about me and why I would excel in my course. I showed why I was passionate in writing, and I did research on a course that didn't exist yet (at that point), and talked to them about the modules that sparked my interest. I brought my portfolio with me in a huge folder.My backup plan was a normal appeal to RP's... Info Comm? It was really a backup plan because I was not interested in the course at all. I was queuing to enrol when I got the call from my course manager. I got into my course at SP!Side note: I think RP really has a bad rep... but there's no such thing as ""worst poly"" 'cause what you make out of your education is really up to you. Of course, interest plays a huge role in what you decide to you.I say this because I think people can tell when you're passionate about something. And also to tell you that even if I didn't get into my course, I wouldn't have regretted asking for a chance.Ask yourself: Why do you want to take a business course? What will you do with a business diploma? What are your aspirations after getting your education? I think if you email them telling them about these things, people would give you a chance.Also if you need help with crafting appeal letters, just PM me!"
Try for ITE. It puts you in a spot where you're somewhat familiar with how poly works and gives you internship experience too. You also learn to work and meet all sorts of ppl!
That’s a huge waste of time.
How is it a waste of time exactly????
"If he wants get into uni in the future, he has to do poly after he finishes ITE. No point wasting time in ITE when his O level results make his eligible to go straight into poly."
"I disagree. If he applied already and the courses that he wants already rejected him, isn't it more prudent to go to ITE and from Higher Nitec transition into Poly and then Uni after NS?"
that’s gonna take a long time.
Doesn't mean its impossible.
the original point was that it would be a waste of time i.e. inefficientthe possibility was never in question
"just take something related lol or go rp , rp's cert is def btr than other poly bc its mainly project based which mimics the actual work. but if you're planning to go university then yea rp isnt the way to go."
That may be appropriate at Uni stage not now
"Write to your mp and keep trying. Appeal. NOW. 15 should be alright to get into polytechnic, I’m quite shocked. Maybe an admin error?Honestly one year difference is okay. But more than two people may feel it?"
"It is likely that he initially applied for courses with cut off points that are way lower than 15, and by the time he appeared for courses with higher cut off points those courses were fullin this case he would not be able to get into the course because they cannot kick someone out for him"
I’m pretty sure somewhere should have a single slot? I dont think every school will reject him with 15 if he’s not going anywhere for sure? I don’t know how common this is but surely not very? I don’t know. Difficult situation

"Which I think is total BS, anyone did it before?"
I can't imagine why MOH would need to be involved with something you are sending out of the country.Don't need to tell SingPost what it is exactly. It's not dangerous goods.
Yeah in the end I bought the stamps and just drop it in the bin. If tracking I need to declare the item.
Are you testing with those online websites?
yeah familytree dna
Let me know if it arrives at the lab successfully. I'm planning to test too.
"There is no critical mass amongst us, the results would be disappointing. Very good for Caucasians. Google and you read about success rates. Was keen myself until I read about coverage."
not really. you can use the sequenced DNA and upload it to other sites
"All the sites have similar coverages. Note no particular site was mentioned. Genealogy and family tree search was pretty advanced in the West. The only other race that has considerable coverage are Blacks in the US, UK and the Caribbean.Kiwis , OZ and white South Africans have comparatively greater penetration despite their distance from Europe.If you are mixed race Asian with a trace of Caucasian blood, it is certainly worth it.Lots of material in the Web on coverage and penetration."
"I used 23andMe. Fedex picked up from my residence, no questions asked"
Yeah but it cost a bombSingPost much cheaper
The delivery and pickup cost is built in with 23andMe kits
Not included in the USD99 right? How much is the shipping?
I paid 149 USD for the kit inclusive of shipping (both ways)
That’s overpriced bro for delivery
I sent it via SingPost. Labeled as cheek swab. Hopefully it arrives
goodluck to us!
Sorry to ask - what is the purpose of this genetic testing?
Huat ah! Good luck redditors!
It has always puzzled me why most people seem to only want to buy tickets on the day of draw. Is it some superstition thing? I bought mine on Monday. No queues. So maybe no luck for me?
"good luck, give me hong bao of 0.5% of you win. xD"
People like to do last min shit
"Heard an uncle explain to me once - They want to see whether they win from sg pools first for the previous draws (horse, 4d, toto) before buying the next one since it's using the 'govt's money' and not theirs.Probably just some weird sense of trying to one-up the govt since I don't really find the explanation logical at all. Lol"
lmao dumb ppl tax is accurate.
Isn't the draw tomorrow night?
"Oh yes it is. I am just used to Toto being on Thursday.. So I guess my observation is not valid, unless the queues are even longer tomorrow."
It is
"It takes time to think up of auspicious numbers mate.The closer it is to the draw date, the closer you get to feel the fengshui"
You must also know some are people who already bought.. Go again on last day to buy more
Because Singaporeans love a queue
Heng i buy in Singapore pools app while sitting on the toilet
Toto got a winner from app? What would it say the location then?
it just states from online.only ever saw that once.
I also want to do that but I not old enough.
Already bought on wednesday. 5 dollar quick pick :X
"With the karma you've earned as news bot, you deserve to win."
"I once dream that I won all the number on toto and my first thought it ""ah I can finally afford to go uni"".. not so sure what kind of education gonna cost me the entire Toto winning loland the worst thing?I rmb the scenario but not rmb the toto number T.T , $1 quick pick for me then"
Bought mine online. Why queue?
Huat Areas luck factor? :)
Aliyah. Must remember to buy later
I’ll throw in $5 or maybe even $10 if my A level results tmr are good. If not I’ll still throw in a $2 🤑
Friday is the best day to cosplay as CaiShen and throw empty angpows with random numbers from 1 to 45 infront of the crowd.
Dress up as CaiShen and Rip their tickets along the queue because you are actually saving them some money.
"Not worth it. Caishen costume too bloody hot in this weather... no returns either (no one give u angpao, instead people expect angpao from u)"
Why queue when you can buy it online? Or via the app???
"not many people know the app exists, or too lazy to do the facetime verification to setup account. even topup of the account is a pain in the ass, minimum topup via Nets is $100 (which I find is too high amount), or need submit application letter to link bank account to your sg pool app, or need to head down to sg pool outlet just to buy the physical $50 topup card."
"Yup, minimum $100 idekwhy. But yeah, it’s a hassle at first because you need to go the Singapore pools outlet to verify yourself, and most of the older generations people doesn’t know how to. So they just do it the old fashioned way of queuing."
"Why do people only buy Hong Bao toto draw? High chance you’re gonna share the money with 3 or more people based on the last few Hong Bao draw if you win. Best time to buy Toto is when the prize amount snowballs to $4million. Anyways, Huat ah! Wish everyone good luck!"
"13/4 is still around 3 million what, and furthermore your 4 million draw might have a chance to split into 2 millions as well? Don’t quite get your argument"
You know something went wrong here when the whole profession was up in arms about it
"Reminds me of Churchill's remark:""They stick together, like doctors in a case that has gone wrong."""
"MOH asks for review of $100,000 fine on doctor who didn't tell patient about side effects of common jabSINGAPORE - The doctor who was fined $100,000 for not telling his patient about the possible complications that could be caused by a commonly used injection might see the penalty reviewed.The Ministry of Health (MOH) has asked the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) to get the case reviewed in court and the SMC has already filed an application, seeking the court’s permission for this.The fine was imposed on Dr Lim Lian Arn by the SMC’s disciplinary tribunal, which had found him guilty. This is the first time that the MOH has asked for the disciplinary tribunal’s decision to be reviewed.The tribunal’s decision caused an uproar within the medical profession.This is because most doctors who give that steroid jab usually do not tell patients of the side effects, which are both rare and transient.Doctors feared that the tribunal’s judgment would set a precedent over the amount of information that they will need to share with their patients and lead to the practice of defensive medicine.The Straits Times Forum pages carried several letters from doctors asking if they now need to alert patients to every possible side effect of every medication they give. One doctor pointed out that even the widely used painkiller, paracetamol, has side effects.More than 5,000 people had signed an appeal, started by another doctor, to share their concerns with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.The subject was also raised in Parliament.Dr Lim Wee Kiak, an MP for Sembawang GRC, said that while the profession is self-regulated, the MOH should nevertheless have oversight of key issues. In this case, the $100,000 fine “is excessive”, he said, asking if the ministry would consider re-opening this case.Related Story Doctors ask MOH if they must spell out all possible side effects after doc fined $100k for not doing soRelated Story SMC tribunal unfair to fine doctor $100,000Senior Minister of State for Health Lam Pin Min had replied that, as both parties had accepted the judgment, there was no need to do so.But on Wednesday (Feb 20), the MOH sent out a statement to say that it has requested the SMC to apply to the Court to review that decision.The statement said the ministry “has noted and understands the concerns in relation to both the decision of the Disciplinary Tribunal (DT) in Dr Lim Lian Arn’s case, and the imposition of a $100,000 fine against Dr Lim.“Sentences have to be commensurate with the circumstances of each case.“Whilst both Dr Lim and the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) may have accepted the sentence, the decision in this case carries with it much wider professional practice implications and also has an impact on future cases.“MOH is of the view that this decision should be reviewed.”The ministry added that it was concerned that the case could “lead to the practice of defensive medicine which would have an adverse impact on patient and clinical safety”.It felt that it would be good for the case to be thoroughly reviewed in court.The SMC agreed. It has asked for appropriate revisions to be made, even though the time for such an appeal has passed.The statement added: “MOH will continue to engage with healthcare professionals to have greater clarity and balance in the practice and processes in the medical community, so as to enhance patient safety and, at the same time, also keep overall healthcare costs affordable.”0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"
"Maybe a little suaku, but can it be inferred that MOH does not think that is a fair verdict?"
"Whether MOH thinks it's unfair, we dunno. But most doctors certainly thinks so. MOH prolly asks for a review now because too many doctors are complaining."
"Maybe a little suaku, but can it be inferred that MOH does not think that is a fair verdict?Fair or not, it sets a dangerous precedent.Because of the verdict, every doctor will have second guesses on every decision they make with regards to their patients.This goes both ways:Patients aren't getting the care they need and deserve because doctors don't dare to give them options. Much safer to tell them to stay home and rest instead of prescribing a pill with about a million and one side effects to give an extreme example.On the other hand, doctors who want to offer treatment (namely most, if not all of them) now must go through the ridiculous process of listing the side effects to each and every patient in case some asshole decides to sue you a few months later because you didn't explicitly tell him/her you might get some scars."
"Defensive medicine, also called defensive medical decision making, refers to the practice of recommending a diagnostic test or medical treatment that is not necessarily the best option for the patient, but an option that mainly serves the function to protect the physician against the patient as potential plaintiff<Looks bad for healthcare in sg if doctors care more about being sued than taking care of patients"
"It is detrimental to patients too if nothing is done about this. Doctors will need to tell grandfather stories with each drug they prescribed, even if the odds of side effects are less than being bitten by otters, leading to even longer waiting times.More blood/urine/etc... tests will be done just to make sure that the patient doesn't have that one-in-a-million allergy to the treatment being prescribed.Defensive medicine is part of the reason why medical costs in the USA can be so high, because of their highly litigious society (not the main contributor, but part of it).There has to be trust between doctors and patients, and a balance on needing 100% certainty."
"There has to be trust between doctors and patients, and a balance on needing 100% certaintyI'm curious - do you think doctors should be allowed to administer treatment without obtaining informed consent (i.e. not warning of any risks)?"
"It depends on the likelihood of such risks, hence the need for balance and not extremes on either side."
"Sure, but the doctor in this case didn't warn of any risks, and one of those experienced by his patient (cortisone flare) is considered relatively common. Would it really take that much time to inform the patient of at least that?I do think the $100k fine is extremely excessive, but the reality is that the doctor did fail to obtain informed consent."
"I'm not a doctor, but given the statements by the other doctors, as well a brief google search, Cortisone Flare is considered a rare occurrence. I was not able to find out the exact percentage, but throughout all the articles I went through, the common theme was, it rarely happens (and in most cases that it does, solvable by Panadol).I'm going to trust the medical doctors on this and accept that it was an unlikely occurrence, and the patient just happened to be ""damned suay""."
"This guy's fine was decided by senior doctors though, not in a court of law or by judges. Seems like there is internal conflict within the medical industry, the senior ones that want to regulate, and the ones that don't want to be regulated."
"the tribunal is made up of 2 senior drs and a lawyer.There are multiple layers to this case though. Firstly who let a seemingly frivolous case get so far? Secondly, who decided to ask for a 5 month suspension? Is it the Disciplinary Tribunal's fault with all these factors in mind? I think they're left with Hobson's Choice when they had to decide between a 100k fine recommended by the defense lawyer vs a 5 month suspension recommended by SMC."
What's the norm for such mistakes? A warning?
"Not sure about precedent cases, but keep in mind that this is a relatively uncommon, mild and transient side effect.For comparison, Singpost was fined 100k too for not discharging their duties, and SMRT was fined 400k for safety lapses that resulted in the death of 2 of their staff."
"From Google:“cortisone flare” reaction has been reported to occur in approximately two percent of patients. This occurs when the injected cortisone crystallizes and causes pain worse than before the shot. Fortunately, these “flares” usually do not last long and resolve with icing after 12 to 48 hours."
"Here's a meta study:pain after injection with a frequency ranging from 3.4-81%mild discoloration of the skin over the site of injection in three studies in 3.2%, 6% and 11.2%, respectivelyskin depigmentation reported in 3 studies with a frequency ranging from 1.3-4%atrophy was mentioned in 5 studies with a frequency ranging from 1.5-40%Also, this doctor submitted anonymous patient files to prove that he usually does warn patients of those side effects, which implies that he generally does think informed consent is necessary for the procedure. This is also common in other countries like the UK - with 85% and 59% of the surgeons discussing local and systemic risks of steroid injections.I'm going to trust the medical doctors on this and accept that it was an unlikely occurrenceI've seen the arguments by medical doctors here, but it does raise the question of whether their current practice of not obtaining informed consent for this procedure is evidence-based."
"Informed consent is a sacred cow in medicine; only to be superseded in emergencies - hence it is definitely wrong to not have obtained it prior to performing a procedure.As current law stands, the case is pretty straightforward in the there was negligence since such consent was not taken.Having said that, I think the issue has been conflated with what you need to discuss when taking an informed consent (in other words, what counts as a material risk).There's a few arguments within the medical community.Some have used this episode to argue that because it is impractical to list any and all risks of a treatment, one can be excused from doing so for commonly done office procedures in the interest of time. The problem with this line of argument is that as we have first established, informed consent is a sacred cow, so the discussion is moot.Others have used this to push their agenda that the Modified Montgomery Test should be re-looked as a standard for offering medical advice (which includes obtaining informed consent). Yet the failure of the doctor in question to even obtain informed consent renders the discussion of which risks should be deemed important and material useless since, again, informed consent was not taken.Yet others have stated that notwithstanding the fact that informed consent was not taken, minimal harm was done to the patient and the patient's decision to receive the treatment would not have changed even if the risks were explained. This is probably the issue most relevant to the case - which whether the punishment was commensurate with the transgression. Like many other doctors, I don't believe so, mostly because the patient would not have opted for a different treatment, the treatment was appropriate, and the harm done was temporary.The problem is that we have too many stakeholders with their own agenda who are trying to latch onto this case to push their own perspectives.I hope that the courts will be able to separate and address these issues for clarityDoes Informed Consent remain a standard of practice?If it does, is the Modified Montgomery Test (which was recently introduced) still valid when it comes to risk counselling?If it is, to what extent are certain procedures exempt or otherwise in view of the fact that medical practice also has logistical (time and manpower) considerations which can make explaining a comprehensive list of material risks difficult?Do providers have any protection from patients who retrospectively regret having a procedure done because an adverse side effect occurred where they would not have complained if nothing untoward happened?What is an appropriate punishment in Dr Lim's case where the ideological informed consent was breached by treatment that was appropriate and harm temporary?Fundamentally, therapeutic relationships are all about trust. Lose that and we lose everything.Hence it is also a good time to ask: to what extent does medical ideology of respecting patient autonomy apply to the lay patient - in other words, doctors practice based on a set of ideals; but do patients care about those ideals at all?Would a patient have complained about his doctor if no consent was taken but everything went well. If the answer is no, perhaps we need to re-look the standard with which we hold doctors or educate patients better.Ideals are great for any endeavour, but they should not hinder practical concerns in daily routine. Balance is required when it comes to doctor and patient interests - and the stakes are far too high for any particular individual to be made an example of and then used as precedent in case law."
"Informed consent is a sacred cow in medicine; only to be superseded in emergencies - hence it is definitely wrong to not have obtained it prior to performing a procedure.Yet you have people here and even some doctors who think that's unimportant. It's what I'm primarily arguing against.This is probably the issue most relevant to the case - which whether the punishment was commensurate with the transgression. Like many other doctors, I don't believe so, mostly because the patient would not have opted for a different treatment, the treatment was appropriate, and the harm done was temporary.I agree, the fine is extremely excessive and a simple warning should have more than sufficed considering that this was apparently a rare lapse for him.Does Informed Consent remain a standard of practice?Do providers have any protection from patients who retrospectively regret having a procedure done because an adverse side effect occurred where they would not have complained if nothing untoward happened?The SMC's clarification does address this. Obtaining informed consent should be standard practice, but doing so verbally and documenting it is sufficient.to what extent are certain procedures exempt or otherwise in view of the fact that medical practice also has logistical (time and manpower) considerations which can make explaining a comprehensive list of material risks difficult?For this particular case, the doctor himself said that it was standard practice to warn of the side effects. The SMC also elaborated:'The experts approached indicated that they would have explained to a patient the possible complications of a H&L Injection, and recorded the explanation and the patient’s consent in the case notes.'Given that there are some doctors who are arguing that informed consent isn't necessary for this procedure, I wholly agree that some degree of standardization is required.What is an appropriate punishment in Dr Lim's case where the ideological informed consent was breached by treatment that was appropriate and harm temporary?I really hope this will be clarified. Even if the doctor requested for the maximum fine, I honestly don't think the disciplinary tribunal should have gone with it.Anyway, thanks for your well thought out. Great read."
"Yet you have people here and even some doctors who think that's unimportant. It's what I'm primarily arguing against.To be fair, Informed Consent as a consequence of respect for patient autonomy was not always the standard of care. Years ago, paternalism (doctor decides) was modus operandi.The problem is how you balance personal agency with (more) efficient healthcare delivery. In which situations can a doctor say that we assumed implied consent in the interest of time and practicality. This needs to be standardised and agreed upon by both patients and doctors - perhaps best formalised through court guidance.I think the important question here is this:As a patient, do you care about medical ethics and the ideals of practice beyond the occurrence of adverse outcomes?Put another way, if a doctor did something wrong but nothing bad happened to you, would you still pursue a complaint with SMC because ideologically he violated some ethical principle (such as autonomy or non-maleficence)?If the answer is no, then why are doctors held to a far higher standard than what is practical to the patient - particularly because the patient is allowed ""retrospective regret"" in situations where the outcome is poor."
Fucking stupid verdict. Imagine doctors being liable to explain the 30 possible side effects of ASPIRIN. I already waste enough time at the doctor because the last guy can't seem to hear his name being called.

"If I fail my first chinese exam in June, is it compulsory for me to take the second chinese exam? I do know that you can choose to take another one if you pass, but not sure if you failed. Thanks to everyone in advance"
"If you're gonna go poly you don't even need Chinese. All you need is:English2 best subjects2 relevant subjects based on course.So if you know your Chinese is bad and definitely not going into your combination, then you don't have to retake."
"if u plan to go uni, u would need to have at least a D7 in Chinese tho, iirc"
so E8 = no uni? damn I’m screwed
Drop to CLB also can. Then qualified.
Also will take the poly route
"Yes, compulsory if you failed your first one."
"It depends on your school and your choice, if you can deal with a fail, and you’re not considering JC, then it doesn’t matter. My experience with it was if I got a D7, I can write in to the school with parental approval, to sit out the next exam. This was nearly 10 years ago tho, so ymmv"
"I took Chinese twice in O level, got F9 both times.If you think you're going to flunk it, just grab Chinese B. Save yourself the trouble, honestly."
"just retake. its free anyways , you'll get 2-3 grades up if u did the mid terms, bc all the As and Bs students left and bellcurve will be severely lowered. even though chinese isnt that important but having a fail grade on your CV is very bad for ur future job or interviews."
"Wait it's free? I spent $40 on it, maybe because I was PR at the time."

"SINGAPORE - For nearly 10 years, the vice-president of a company dealing with transportation used an array of devices to capture sexually compromising images of 11 women including family members and subordinates.The 58-year-old man, who was sacked when police started their investigations, used mobile phones as well as digital and spy cameras to commit his offences from 2007 to October 2016.His victims included three of his wife's younger sisters, her brother's wife and four subordinates. Another three of his victims were unknown.The man, who cannot be named due to a gag order to protect his victims' identities, was jailed for a year on Thursday (Feb 21) after pleading guilty to 28 counts of insulting a woman's modesty.He also admitted to one count of disposing of two recording devices which could be produced as evidence of his offences. Seventy-nine other charges were considered during sentencing.Deputy Public Prosecutor Eunice Lau said that the man also had a ""fetish"" for using editing software Photoshop to tweak the images - replacing the heads of pornography models with those of his victims.The court heard that viewing these modified images sexually excited him.DPP Lau added that for the cases involving his family members, the man ""capitalised"" on his role as the family photographer to ""facilitate his offending innocuously"" during gatherings.She told District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim: ""As the accused had a ready excuse for always having his digital camera on hand, he shrewdly made use of this to take compromising shots of his female relatives under the guise of his role as photographer.""And as for his subordinates, the man made use of his interactions with them during work meetings to obtain compromising images of them when they were seated.DPP Lau added: ""Given the frequency of the work meetings, the accused was able to obtain multiple such shots of the victims in this manner. These shots also included photographs and video recordings of the victims on overseas work trips.""The man's offences came to light in September 2016 when three of his colleagues - all men - spotted him holding his mobile phone in a suspicious manner near one of the victims on separate occasions.The trio alerted their company's head of human resources and lodged a police report on Oct 4, 2016After providing his first statement to the police, the man went back to his office the next day to obtain two recording devices, which he threw away.The court heard that one of the devices was shaped like a USB thumb drive while the other looked like a pen.Defence lawyer Roger Yek told the court in his mitigation plea that his client had cooperated with the police.For each count of insulting a woman's modesty, he could have been jailed for up to a year and fined."
"Can some lawyer explain to me the part about how ""For each count of insulting a woman's modesty, he could have been jailed for up to a year and fined"", and with 28 count he somehow only ended up with 1 year of jail???"
Concurrently.

"Hi,I would like to clarify whether is Airbnb illegal in Singapore.The latest information I can find is this:https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/nz-familys-airbnb-woes-highlight-lack-of-clarity-on-listingsPrivate homes here are subject to a minimum rental period of three consecutive months, and six months for public housing.Is this still accurate?I also found this; https://www.reach.gov.sg/participate/public-consultation/urban-redevelopment-authority/development-control-group/public-consultation-on-short-term-accommodationbut the link to the paper is 404'ed"
"It is not that Airbnb is illegal. It is legal, but the minimum rental periods are as you wrote.

"Eh I do remember a time where anecdotally speaking, the choice mp3 player of my peers in jc and then NS was pretty much split down the middle between the iPod and the creative mp3 player, whatever it was called.

I still have mine. Haven't powered it on in ages but I have it!
"For you kids, no, but for us older folk there was a time when Creative really did had a much larger share in the MP3 player market. While Apple eroded it pretty quickly Creative was a rival in that space for a while and managed to trade blows for a bit. Apple's marketing was always stronger and the moment the iPod was compatible for Windows machine that was pretty much it."
Were they that big outside of Asia too?
Bought the following items from Creative in the pastSoundblaster 16Soundblaster Live!Soundblaster Audigy 2ZSSoundblaster X-FiNomadNomad II MGMost of them were pretty good. Shame that their marketing campaign ain’t as good as Apple
"Bought a Soundblaster Live Arena headset in 2008 and I used it last year when my current headset broke. SB Live worked perfectly fine, creative make good shit."
sooo the newest thing you got from them is more than 10 years old?
Wow! Not that you mentioned it. Has it been 10 years? Can’t seem to remember buying Creative products in recent times.
"The headline has to say ""Steve Jobs Rival"" because nobody (outside Singapore and the tech industry) has heard of Sim Wong Hoo."
Sim Wong Hoo is a name made up of surnames.
I thought because he got rich off other people's ideas too.
"Had the fortune of owning an X-Fi 2 mp3 player while everyone else got hyped over the iPod and struggled with iTiu iTunes. Used it with a UE Super-Fi 5 iems and that was how I got poisoned into entry-level audiophile...Also own a pair of T40 S2 speakers, probably 6 or 7 years old by now. Paid for itself several times over by being so durable."
Had the zen stone. loved it. creative aurvana live also have a pretty good following currently for best bang for buck (though the tech is fostex's i think). hope he makes it!
My creative zenpod still works great.
"One company hire and give salary based on paper, and the other based on role / skill.Lol creative hiring like other SG companies are a joke and only to fill up quotas. Most department just end up using underpaid contract agency workers for cost and kpi. Their technical questions interview all like they are looking for best of the best and make people go through 7 circle of hellish interviews. Nobody seem to question why would the best even consider going to a mere SG companies.Not surprised that they view Apple as rival and think they were on par. Typical delusion SG companies.*is AirPods business alone bigger than creative? That would truly be indictment of SG culture"
Should I feel bad that I only know creative as the company that makes Chinese e-dictionaries and speakers

Just pick up the call and shout out your credit card number + the 3 digits at the back. And they won't call again.

Why is RP being viewed as a lousier poly? I know their entry requirements are easier but in the end its still a diploma right? Just like Yishun/Innova JC is the easiest to enter among all JC but in the end still take the same ALevels exams right?
"Elitist mentality, the same people that will bash private uni grads."
Curious who actually makes fun of RP because I don't remember anyone from JC or Uni talking shit about them. Wouldn't it mostly be kids from other polys?
"Yea true, people from other poly."
"Cause people from JCs generally have no idea about the social politics of polytechnics, lol."
It’s all the same to us lol. Going to a poly in general is considered adventurous and dangerous to people from jcs
"RP is the newest poly, so they don't have the brand recognition to attract better students as much as SP or NP do. They also use the PBL system. PBL is hard as shit especially if you're a subpar student used to being spoonfed. Unfortunately, a chunk of their student population are exactly this, refusing to adapt to PBL, get frustrated and complain about the system to parents and friends. Words spread like wildfire and you get the stereotype that RP has today."
"Shit I think this is exactly it, brother always bitched about how much he hated RP and told me not to go there, used to blame my mom for encouraging him to go RP, said RP was filled with useless people because of the COP. Graduated with a 2.8 GPA."
ELI5 what is PBL system? The pros and cons?
https://mothership.sg/2018/05/rp-student-pbl-changed-life/
Thanks. Now I see why some cursed it. Those who excel in spelling tests and textbook learners will likely face uphill challenges to transit to PBL.
RP alumni here and I'm a software engineer. PBL does help.
There should be a uni - degree with PBL. Tutorial style learning is ancient and unproductive
there are quite a few universities overseas that adopt the pbl pedagogy
Like? They should offer it here as offshore learning too (sim / Kaplan).Or local uni should have courses / modules that implement such style (nus already has Design-Your-Own-Module (DYOM) initiative). Now there should be a change on how classes are being conducted outside of tutorial style.
"off the top of my head, university of bradford. I also saw one US Uni using it for their DPT programme.nah it would be too difficult to conduct PBL for distance learning I think because class size is usually small and it would take up too much resources, which would lead to high tuition fees"
"For cost and presence, maybe a collaboration with RP? 2.5 diploma +1.5 years degree + (maybe optional, 1 year internship / fyp), available for top 10-15% of cohort for selected courses. Like SIT, but more integrated with RP PBL style."
That would make RP COP plummet like crazy. I wouldn't mind it though cos I wanna go RP HAHA
Cop?

"Correct me if I'm wrong but this comparison is faulty as in the case for Y/IJC it is still centrally assessed. But for RP the assessment is in house,i.e. an A in poly A is not equivalent to A in poly B. This is also true for across faculty and universities???"
"Yea it is in house. Even within the faculty, all diplomas have differences in their modules. So no 2 diploma programme are the same. But what I can say is MOE do review their course content for all 5 local polytechnic and 6 local university. So if one applies for a government job, all are equally recognised. But private companies might hold a different measuring scale.Edit: sorry, forget to add in NAFA, Laselle and NUS high school as local diploma too."
Does MOE review merely the content or the assessment process as well?
"From what I've heard, To get a pass on a module, just turn up every single lesson (on time, of course), do the Reflection Journal (RJ) every day and don't be an asshole during group projects.Exams are open book. Yeah, you read that right. You can access all the information you want during the exam, but it's all offline.Probably why RP is been seen as the 'easier' poly to graduate from. That reputation might have an effect on immediate future job prospects."
RP is easier to pass compared to other polys but harder to do very well in imo. Daily grading where you have to put in your best every day for the lecturer to award you that holy A is necessary for an overall A grade for the module. A for exams are simply not enough. Going to RP honestly gurantees you a minimum 2.0 GPA unless you legitimately never come for lessons BUT it is a huge pain to maintain a >3.4.
"Exactly, thats what many people dont understand and think its easy to get high gpa in rp. In fact i feel that a gpa 3.5 in rp is equals to 3.9 in SP."
"Exams are open book but that doesn't make things any easier.To clarify, all the questions are application questions. There are no ""Define x"" type of questions. So what you need to do is remember the concepts and apply them in the questions. If you forget the appropriate concept to apply, that's what your notes are for. That still doesn't mean that the notes will tell you how to apply them.Also, it's not true that you just have to turn up for lesson to pass."
"I found open book exams to be harder. Essentially it’s like them saying, “bring whatever you want lol idc”.Plus I noticed many people bring too many things during one, and end up spending too much time frantically flipping through stuff. It resulted in insufficient time to finish or review their paper so it isn’t always a good thing to have open book tests."

"Cut off point is lower than the rest of the local polytechnics, quite new polytechnic compared to the rest. Thus, doesn't have a ""good reputation"" according to them."
There are much fewer RP grads in local uni than the older 4.
"I heard from a friend that ended up in RP before transferring to TP, apparently in RP it's everyday research something, make PPT and present, and it's not effective or something."
"I'll try to go into it.P.S I'm typing this on phone and I frequently save draft to do other things or check on sources so my grammar and spelling might be a lil rough.I'd like to preface this that I THINK this is really people just taking the piss rather than some super serious issue of elitism. When people on here ask questions about RP, questions are always helpful. didn't really see any mean comments I guess while people in RP could be offended by it, I feel it's more memeing than some malicious attempt to make RP students feel like shit.Republic Poly is newer and started in 2002, insitutions of higher learning build up credibility the longer they have been around I guess some of the reasons could include having an established alumni network, being more established,reputable and having more research being published.MIT - Founded in 1861Harvard - Established in 1636National University Of Singapore - Founded in 19053) Republic Polytechnic has non competitive cut-off points(COP). I think it would be safe to say that competitive courses would have a higher percentage of competitive and driven people.COP is also represenative of popularity, now what could be the cause of a low popularity? Bad facilities? Poor lecturers? Lack of funding? Useless modules? Now this is why a low COP will make people see it as an inferior poly.That's all the reasons I can think of. Anyways i'd like to say that prejudice, elitism and stereotypes are a funny thing,Imagine this scenario, someone points a gun to your head and asks, ""There was a recent crime case of a gang fight involving students. Where were the majority of students from? If you answer correctly i'll let you go with a million dollars but if you answer wrongly i'll pull the trigger.A)ITEB)PolyC)JC”If you chose A you'd probably win.Now imagine the same scenario but instead he asks you ""A student was caught abusing adderall(drugs to help you concentrate on studying helping you gain better scores) to do better on his exam now tell me where was he from?A)ITEB)PolyC)JC""If you chose C you would most likely be correct."
I do argee with u that in general its just a memeing and not a malicious attack. But the examples you gave is comparing at a much bigger scale. Ite vs poly vs jc. What I felt is that RP should hold equal standing with the other 4 local government poly. The reason is because it is still a poly that trains you for a diploma. I have not brought GPA into the picture but my point is that a RP diploma cert shall be as equally presitigious as a SP diploma cert.
"Not sure for local university applications but off the top of my head I recall one foreign university application where they specifically required RP students to have higher GPA to enter (e.g. 3.0 GPA for other Polys but 3.2 GPA for RP). I might be misremembering though!Perhaps because it is relatively new, it is not recognized at the same level. At the end of the day it is still a diploma certificate but some employers may still discern and differentiate diplomas from different polys. This is not exclusive to RP (e.g. certain employers prefer diplomas from certain polys for their specific field).Though RP seems to draw the shorter end of the stick for such comparisons from what I've heard. It is also perceived that it is easier to have a higher GPA from RP than other Polys because after all, exams are bell curved and the COP for RP is much higher."
"Not true that GPA is bell curved. I have friends from all 5 polys and I hear the same for all polys. There will be some modules that there will be bell curve when there is a high failure rate or high amount of A students. But in general, most modules do not have a bell curve. So bell curve only play a very small part in GPA, regardless which poly you are from."
I graduated from a business related course in one of the Polys and my course modules are bell curved. I only learnt about that from my lecturers in my third year of study. Not sure about the other courses.
"Social standing just takes time to build. The lower COP doesn’t help with perceptions either since it makes them look cheap.So while “officially” their standing might be the same, there’s no way people view them the same way."
Edited 54 minutes ago. RIP.
Not completely gone. It is still mentioned.
Lol I caught it.
yea... someone else made the edits to put RP back. it was obvious though.

I'm an RP student and there are RP students who are in NUS and NTU so yeah...
"such an old thing, its not even funny anymore.also wasn't from rp but a diploma is a diploma /smhmost important from poly especially if you intend to go to uni is to farm GPA. doesn't matter which poly you come from, or how low the cutoff point is for the course (for O levels)."
Exhibit A: why you should not cite wikipedia even on online arguments to bluff you are right
"Other poly students still stuck at outdated / unproductive tutorial style. PBL is a much better way to learn, SG should have uni that use PBL instead of tutorial too. (Obviously only effective on certain modules, but school teaching method shouldn’t be binary)"
fun fact : sprejects.com links to np website

"alright, here goes: due to personal reasons i'm transferring to another secondary school for my secondary four year. as a pure lit kid, im Primarily concerned about the shift in the literature syllabus given that the examined literature varies across schools and that i've studied two pieces in particular for a year or so. online resources on the matter have proved less than helpful, so uhh. is there a way to take literature lessons externally, or am i simply impelled to somehow mug the two books prescribed by the school?any advice would be appreciated!also it'd be very helpful if you can drop some lit essay pointers because i tend to meander and wax abstract without particular focus in mine but the above takes precedent for obvious reasons"
"Write concisely. Use PEEL method for lit essays. Cannot go wrong especially for unseen. Relying on online sources/spark notes only get you so far. The online sources are good for highlighting to you the key points & important scenes/text.Go read your assigned text and map out themes with concrete examples/plot points/characterisation. You have to know the important scenes and certain key quotes well. When you are all done, then you start on past-year papers (go beg from your new classmates & start practising. Then beg your new lit cher to mark)Lastly, make sure you are sure of the various literary terms (metaphors, personifications, tone, setting, plot) and apply them aptly in your essays.Instead of writing long winded stories when you want to discuss the use of plot in contributing to certain themes, write concisely, better still memorise and drop pertinent quotes. (Flag your assigned text appropriately esp. if open book exam)example for lord of the flies:(16/25 marks writing) the theme of death was important because the children danced around a pig that was burning on fire.(Better grade writing): the theme of death was illustrated during the scene in which the boys danced around the burning pig in the dark. The pig was depicted as “rotting with flies, with eyes gleaming in the dark” (i forgot the exact quote but u get the idea). This created an imagery of darkness and debauchery and elicited feelings of fear and horror within the readers. (Like that you show that you know what is imagery, how is it used in the plot and the effects of it and you use a “good” quote)When you want to connect one idea to the next, move onto the next point smoothly by grouping similar ideas. (This can be achieved by spending at least 5-10mins to plan how to write your essay before you start writing)E.g This theme of death is repeated during scenes of XX when character x did something to character y.Most important tip, stick to simple and clear writing. Avoid using bombastic words and long sentence structures if you are not sure what you want to express.Every good lit student has well-worn hardcopies with multiple small notes & highlights and possibly re-written mindmaps. O level lit is definitely muggable compared to A level lit, at least when I was a student."
"The content may change but the skills are transferable, are they not?"
"Yeah this. Regardless of what lit text you study, you ought to apply the same skills of analysis to it. Don't treat texts differently based on how you perceive them."
"If you can self study, and you've already been studying the prescribed texts for o level lit in your sec 3 year, why not ask the school if you could continue with those texts? The exam paper is the same after all, you just answer a different set of questions from your peers."
do ignore my punctuation and/or lack thereof lmfao
"Would just like to bring up a black horse topic that might dramatically raise the cost of living in Singapore simply due to the amount of applications this item has in every industry.Some might say ""Eh walao eh, i also don't drive diesel car, knn who cares if the diesel tax rise sia!"" tsk tsk tsk! Read on and see how this might affect you.Before talking about the Diesel Tax, I would first like to talk about GST, Goods and Services Tax.GST - GOODS AND SERVICES TAXThe GST Tax system is actually a really fair tax system for which when a company joins the GST system, there is no double charge for the consumer. Let me explain:For Example:I'm Subway (The sandwich guy) and i need some flour and other ingredients to make my bread dough.I am GST Registered.I buy my flour, 1000 KG of it from Prima, which is also GST Registered and it costs SGD $1,000.00 /- + GST SGD $70.00/-.That SGD $70.00 actually gets deducted from the GST which i collect on behalf of the government which is levied on my Sales.So... if i sold SGD $1,400.00/- of Sandwiches for which the GST collected is SGD $98.00, I pay the Government SGD $98.00-SGD $70.00 = SGD $28.00 /-Therefore, it is actually possible for the Government to write me a cheque to ""refund"" me the GST if i actually collect less GST then my consumed GST.This makes it impossible for the companies to double charge the consumer for GST as the GST paid can be deducted from the GST collected.DIESEL TAX, PREVIOUSLY @ SGD $0.10 / LITRE NOW DOUBLED TO SGD $0.20 / LITREDiesel is used everywhere in the industry and no one can escape using it.Have a kid? Takes a School Bus? it uses Diesel.Late for a date? Wana take a Hyundai Taxi? Diesel.The Lorry which sends the rice, bread and other goods to the Mama Shop below your house? Diesel.The Singpost / DHL / Fedex van that delivers a box/es of joy which contains your Amazon / Lazada Purchases? Diesel.The Pokka Van that reloads the vending machine of every single 500 ml Bottle of that sweet sweet dopamine juice at your Army Camp? Diesel.The Air-con Repair man who you wouldn't want your GF or Wife to be too close to? Diesel.You get the point...Any and every van, lorry or bus uses Diesel as its propellant. Other than that, the food industry uses Diesel fueled industrial boilers to cook their food and those traffic jam causing 20KM/H cranes and bulldozers too uses Diesel as its propellant.So How the F*** does that Affect me?If you can't already see how this affect you, let me throw you an example.Example 1: Bread MakerThe current Price of Industrial Raw Diesel stands at $0.90 / Litre (With $0.10 Diesel Tax) As of 21st Feb 2019.After the NEW Tax, it is now $1.00 / Litre, about a 10% Rise in Price.In our example, we will look at how the end consumer of Bread gets affected by a 10% rise in the total cost of Diesel.Our consumer will be buying bread together with other items and asking for a delivery service to his/her home.Tier 01 - Flour ProducerThe Flour Producer pays an extra 10% in fuel costs to bring the flour from the warehouse to the factory for processing.Tier 02 - Flour TransportThe Flour Producer pays an extra 10% in fuel costs to bring the processed flour from plant to Bread Producer.Tier 03 - Bread ProducerThe Bread Producer pays an extra 10% in fuel costs for the industrial boiler which it needs to produce bread.Tier 04 - Bread TransportThe Bread Producer pays an extra 10% in fuel costs to bring the bread to the supermarket.Tier 05 - Supermarket TransportThe Supermarket pays an extra 10% to bring the bread to the consumer.This is a typical industrial flow for an F&B application. As you can see, unlike the GST System the Diesel Tax appears at every level.Assuming that all the companies involved keeps their Profit Margins, where does the cost go to?? THE CONSUMER.Good luck paying for all the additional Diesel Tax!There are many other ways the Diesel Tax can turn around to bite your ass. But basically, I would expect the Public Bus Fares to rise soon, as listed companies often do whatever it takes to protect their Profit Margins.And lets not forget about the 9% GST Looming around the corner..."

"Who say no one wins, Singapore POOLS bank is filling fast."
"To help businesses adjust, the Government will also provide a 100 per cent road tax rebate for one year and partial road tax rebate for another two years for commercial diesel vehicles.Besides these, there will be an extra cash rebate of up to S$3,200 over three years for buses using diesel, such as school buses and eligible private-hire or excursion buses used to ferry school children.SourceTbh so long as the gov is also putting in place measures to help businesses transition (and it appears that they are), I am all for reducing diesel consumption. Global warming and all that jazz."
No mention for construction vehicles and industrial equipment ;) I'm just here to say that it will affect the end consumers btw. Thanks!
as if you can get a trailer/prime mover truck or even the portable cranes to run on petrol/hybridit's absolutely needed in heavy duty vehicles that haul shit around for us. the tax doesn't just impact those commuter vehicles like taxis/mini-buses which have alternatives
"Eh to be fair taxi companies are now switching to petrol/hybrid vehicles.I expect LTA to replace the buses with petrol/hybrid in the next 10 years.Anyway, the writing on the wall for Diesel vehicles was already there at least 5 years ago when the government was mulling removing diesel vehicles because of its pollutants."
there are no alternative methods of transport for the industry (Industrial Application) as of yet. This means everyone has to eat the diesel tax until it happens.
Which is why they didn't just jack up the tax like crazy. It will be a slow increment to nudge people to replace their diesel vehicles with something else.Anyway I recall in 2017 the 10cents a litre tax came in so yeah once the COE is up time to change
"What about Buses, Bullozers, Vans and Lorries? What do you replace them with...? Dead end with no replacement isn't sustainable."
"No worries, the people who have zero knowledge about heavy industry will keep insisting that everyone should change to petrol/hybrid without reading your earlier explanation that for heavy workload diesel is only the way."
"Inflation has been low for a long time now (thanks to falling COEs and stable housing prices), the timing of the government is actually pretty good to pass price-raising taxes."
"First of all, not all of the tax burden will be passed on to consumers. Next, all the diesel consuming machines need to be replaced one day due to wear and tear. By then, producers might switch to non diesel production methods if it is more efficient due to the highest costs of production caused by the tax."
"That might be the case, but the consumers still get taxed more, which is my point."
10% additional spending on fuel doesn’t necessarily mean 10% additional cost on stuff we buy. Depending on what you’re looking at maybe the 10% is so negligible that it doesn’t necessitate a price hike.
"True. I'm only here to highlight the fact that prices might increase, didn't say it's surely 10% nor can anyone truly calculate how much it will increase right now. Some products and services will surely have their prices increased, you can't point a finger and say which one, but it's a general trend."
I doubt it will make a significant difference. It's 10c per litre after all; other raw materials for the provision of goods/services are going to exceed that.
"It depends on the industry, but based on the raw cost of diesel that $0.10 is almost a 10% rise. That means if the company spends $1000 on diesel a month, it now has to pay $1100. That is a significant increase."
"Understand. But what proportion of a product's or service's price is fuel costs?Let's do some math. Diesel prices are around $1.90 per litre now. The new tax means it will cost $2.00 per litre. Assuming we use the worst case scenario, a school bus driver using a diesel powered bus; we can additionally make a few more assumptions of fuel consumption @ 8 km/L and 90000km travelled per year. That will require 11250 litres of diesel which equates to a cost difference of $1125 per year.That's not really an ""insignificant"" sum but it will be spread over a year amongst multiple school students. The marginal increase in price is likely going to be limited; and this is in an industry where fuel costs form the bulk of the expenses."
"For a school bus, the consumption is more like 4 KM/L and about 240 KM a day. 60L a day. 60$0.10 = $6.00. $622 Weekdays = $132.00 extra per month, $1,584.00 a year.From the way I can pull info out from thin air, i guess it's pretty obvious I'm in the industry.For Vans (Delivery) I. E. Toyota Hiace, Toyota Dyna the KM/L is 8.0 KM/L about 300 KM a day 12 hour vehicle duty cycle. 37.5L a day. 37.5*$0.10 = $3.75. $3.75 *30 (Monthly) = $112.50, $1,350 a year.It significantly eats into margins."
"4km/L is really terrible. Maybe this also makes a case for petrol-hybrid buses which will likely be more fuel efficient?In any case, what percentage of your total operating expenses is $1500 per year? What's your current profit margin? And combining the two, how much would you need to raise the unit price of your service/product in order to make the difference?Assuming all you do is ferry 30 schoolkids to and from the school daily. It averages out to an additional $53 per student per year. Using MOE's average annual school bus costs of $1080 works out to a ~5% increase, which may not be difficult to stomach by parents."
"Hey, that's still an increase! Which is what I'm trying to point out."
"With regards to Petrol Hybrids, that's not possible. A school bus has an unladen weight of about 10 tonnes, petrol costs more than Diesel and does not have the energy density Diesel has. Given the mileage the buses rack up in such a short time, the hybrid systems will go kaput fast and at the end of the day, the cost of repair will still have to be part of the margins. Batteries are expensive, some $30,000 per bus possibly (with labour).That being said, no company produces such a product anyway. You can only buy a vehicle that was produced somewhere by someone.KM/L Proof - School Bus"

One of the main problems they should address is the fake reviews made by the sellers.
"Carousell launching new review system and tech to tackle fraudstersTo counter the rise in e-commerce scams, Carousell plans to use new technology to identify and block fraudsters from creating new accounts.The online selling platform will also launch a feedback system allowing buyers to review sellers, so customers can have a better idea of vendors' behaviour, the company said on Tuesday.E-commerce scams jumped to 2,125 cases last year, up by 11.4 per cent from 1,907 cases in 2017. About 70 per cent of them took place on Carousell, police said in their annual crime briefing yesterday.However, according to Carousell's calculations, its fraud rate has fallen by 44 per cent from the first quarter of last year.In the fourth quarter of last year, only about three in 10,000 transactions were fraudulent, said Carousell's vice-president of operations, Ms Tan Su Lin.Ms Tan added that the company had taken measures to prevent fraud over the past year.In June last year, it introduced Caroupay, a payment system which holds a buyer's payment and releases it to the seller only when both parties are satisfied with the transaction.The firm also introduced fraud detection technology last year that can automatically detect and take down malicious online content.Its team of content moderators - which reviews user reports and takes down bad accounts or listings - has been doubled in size to cover more content faster.AIMING FOR 'CLOSE TO ZERO' SCAMS As with crimes all over the world, I think no city can boast zero scams, so our target is to drive it (the number of scams) as close to zero as we can. MS TAN SU LIN, Carousell's vice-president of operations, saying the firm will continue to have zero tolerance towards scams.""Taking heart from the fact that our efforts have produced really good results, we're pushing at it and we're doing more,"" said Ms Tan.Carousell will soon roll out new digital fingerprinting technology to prevent repeat fraudsters from creating new accounts to cheat users.It identifies a fraudster's ""digital persona"", picking out a set of digital signals that fraudsters leave behind on the Internet which would single them out when they try to create new accounts.Related Story Carousell cuts fraud rate by 44% over past yearRelated Story New appointments at Carousell to drive regional growthRelated Story Over 800 fall victim to scams on Carousell""You close one door, and they (fraudsters ) open another window somewhere else, so we do prioritise doing things that stop them from coming back,"" said Ms Tan.Carousell will also launch a new user feedback and star rating system on its app, where buyers can rate sellers on specific details of the transactions, such as the quality of goods.Potential buyers would thus have a better idea of which sellers to trust, said Ms Tan.She acknowledged that scams could still happen on the platform, but added that the company will continue to have zero tolerance towards scams.""As with crimes all over the world, I think no city can boast zero scams, so our target is to drive it (the number of scams) as close to zero as we can.""0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

HAHAHAH win
"After a decade at Mediacorp, Peter Yu walked away in 2000.The Channel 8 actor wanted to see what the wider world had to offer.He busied himself selling cars, property and stocks. He drove a taxi.He was also a full-time gambler. ""Gambling was my career for three years,"" he says with a laugh.He bet on football and created a home office, where its walls were covered in maps and fixtures from around the world. He analysed scores and consulted experts.But that line of work tanked, following heavy losses in the third year of his attempt to become a professional punter. Then, starting in 2015, acting offers trickled in for parts in commercials, short films and television shows.Now a fervent Christian, he attributes the sudden influx of offers to the will of God.In church testimonials that can be found online, he speaks about how his life spun out of control following the divorce from his first wife, actress and host Quan Yifeng, with whom he has a daughter.These days, the mellow 51-year-old says he enjoys acting more than he used to in the 1990s.A role in a short film led to his discovery by film-maker Yeo Siew Hua, who cast Yu as investigator Lok in his award-winning drama, A Land Imagined.Last year, the missing-persons mystery won the Golden Leopard prize at the Locarno Film Festival and the Best Film prize in the Asian Feature Film Competition section of the Singapore International Film Festival.A Land Imagined is showing in cinemas.Related StoryMovie review: Dreamlike detective story A Land Imagined seeks to unsettleThe years that Yu spent doing various jobs has made him a better actor, he reckons.For example, in the scenes shot in the industrial zone in Tuas, the sight of massive earth-moving machinery, noise, fumes and intense lights might seem other-worldly to most Singaporeans.But not to him. He felt comfortable there.""As a taxi driver, you drive all over, so you see everything,"" he says.But filming took the actor to places he had never been, such as the all-hours cybercafes in which migrant workers from China might spend hours chatting with friends back home or playing games.Shooting scenes also took him to the dormitories where workers lived, places which few Singaporeans have seen.""Who will want to go to the dormitories? Yeo Siew Hua put it on the screen. He is showing you the real Singapore,"" he says.Overseas, festival audiences have been fascinated by a side of a crazy rich country they had not seen or heard about, he adds.Now that his acting career is gathering momentum, he is not looking back.He has a supporting part in the television series based on Dick Lee's stage musical, Fried Rice Paradise, set to launch on Channel 5 and Toggle in July.Yu, who is married to sales merchandiser Brenda Leow, can also be seen in the monster movie, Circle Line, expected in cinemas later this year.Yu and Leow have two sons, aged two and six. He is now busy enough as an actor that he can give up his other job.""I returned the taxi I was renting to ComfortDelGro. It was costing too much to let it sit idle,"" he says."
How are the hawker stalls gonna manage/prioritise orders though? Cook for those in the queue or pick ups? Restaurants don't really have this problem afaik cause they have many cooks but usually hawker stalls are smaller operations?

"What's that burning smell?Oh, just investor money."
"the pusheen burger,omgI'm not a cute things person but AAAAAA"
"Some context for those not in the know. Our good friend across the border, Dr Mahathir, likes to disturb Singapore by saying it is paying too little for the water we get from Johore. But he conveniently forgets to mention a few things.1st is that Johore buys back treated water from Singapore at a discounted rate, and I think Johore has been buying back more water than what was originally in the contract. So who pays for the treatment? Singapore does, and it sells back to Johore at a discount meaning it absorbs most of the treatment cost.2nd thing Dr M, doesn't talk about is the facilities Singapore built at the river in Johore, the damming facilities, the treatment plant. And it is still maintained by Singapore so they are still annual costs to maintain it.And 3rd thing is that Dr M could have renegotiated the price of water, once in 1982, and once more in the early 2000s. First time he didnt negotiate, and 2nd time he sort of pulled the deal when it was about to be completed. I rmb vaguely that Singapore was ready to offer up to 60sen per 1000 gallons, a price increase of 20 times from the original negotiated price.So Dr. M crying that Singapore is unfair is not a completely accurate statement, and Dr M is taking a leaf from Trump's playbook. Repeat a lie enough times, and it becomes a truth."
"Country in shit, need to distract people away from internal problems. So use this issue to fuel anger. Too bad his logic a lot of holes and social media so prevalent. Everyone can see thru his bullshit.1970-1990 still got chance to bluff since no social media and all news through state controlled media. Nowadays hard la. Use this tactic = LPPL only."
"singapore is da bogeyman mah. always has been, always will be as long as che det is in power."
"Yeah. Sadly. But the silver lining is that with social media, people from both sides of the straits can judge for themselves and share opinions on what M'hathir says"
ya the truth is always somewhere in between.... even for our side too...waiting for triggered nationalists in 3- 2- 1
"Yup. Nothing unites a country more than a common enemy, so he's trying to make Singapore into that adversary.One of the last times he raised a fuss conveniently was the same time there was a huge anti ICERD rally in KL against the UN anti discrimination bill. The Malays were afraid that it would hurt their position in Malaysia."
Dr M seems to be a common enemy for Singaporeans to rally against too - seems he’s doing a good job both sides of the causeway...
Still wonder how he got his PhD.
U mean his doctorate degree or Permanent head Damage?
Both.
I thought he was a Medical Doctor no?
"Yes, he is a medical doctor. Wish it was a PhD in economics though..."
Is he a Private Hire Driver too?
🤔
"You are right. In the early 2000 negotiations, higher prices were agreed to but changed.Aug 2000: Singapore was ready to pay a higher price in return for a long term supply of water15 Aug 2000: Leaders agreed that in return for Malaysia selling water to Singapore beyond the expiry of the current agreements, Singapore will pay 45 sen per 1000 gallons now and to foot the bill for building water works that will increase the yield of Johor River estimated to cost 835 million ringgitsFeb 2001: Dr Mahathir said that Johor believed that 60 sen was fair. Singapore counter offered 45 seen now and 60 sen after 2011.March 2002: Malaysia wanted 60 sen for water now and the price to be backdated to 1986 and 1987. it also wanted 3 ringgit for water between 2007 and 2011 and then from 2011 the price would be adjusted yearly for inflation.September 2002: Malaysia presented another pricing formula and the water price arrive was 6.25 ringgits.All units of water is in 1000 gallons"
Just a small thing. It’s Johor; no E at the end. Let’s go for full accuracy!

"Your country is not a mess, neither is Mahathir hopeless. After all, there have been good times under Tun’s leadership and it’s unfair to belittle the work he has done. Tidak #maluapabosskuAlbeit I think there is much work to be done due to the diverse interests of different factions in the government. ‘The enemy is down south’ narrative is probably not working as well as it did donkey years ago due to tech advances and globalisation.Rather there can be constructive diplomacy and foreign relations to make sure the country can progress and not be taking the short end of the stick. Leverage on instruments like ASEAN and SLD!"

"that's a tiam tattoo on the forehead, not a bindi for Indian women"
What’s a tiam tattoo?
A special tattoo that denotes the person wearing it is of certain rank in a secret society
"Given the manpower/respect commanded, what's the closest rank equivalent of such people in military context?"
"Nice try, SSB.But in all honestly i dont really know. Maybe a Captain or smth.Edit: I believe they are Red Poles"
"last time i heard tiam means fighter siao, not rank but skills/achievement badge lol, but the only guys i know all is green color."
"So, commando encik with ranger tab for the tiams?"
Got office paper pusher scholar role not? /s
"Tiam is like a combat skill batch given to gangster to denote that they are fighter level and should be “feared” also got tear drops etcMember identification Members of this secret society often tattoo lines of dots called 'tiam' in Hokkien on their foreheads or even five dots on each knuckle on their fingers to identify themselves as 'fighters'. Teardrops on the cheeks are also quite common to signify they have recently lost a 'brother' due to a gang attack or have no more tears to cry, or blood drop below their lips to signify that they won't bleed during a fight."

"As an ang mo exchange student who doesn't know Singlish, I have no idea what this picture says"
"Pardon me, you've only stated the fact that we purchase water from you at 3 sen / 1k Gallons. What you failed to mention, however, is that we treat and purify the water at 240 sen / 1k Gallon, and we sell the treated water back to you at 50 sen / 1k Gallon. We're therefore absorbing the difference of 190 sen. Mother Fucker.By the way, the Chinese words come from a gang chant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlhEAdPxIX4&feature=youtu.be&t=53 , which is the gangster way of an invitation to discuss an issue."
sen = cent
"Translation : This situation is crazy. You declare that Singapore buys water at such a cheap price of 3 cents per 1 kilogallon, but you did not mention that we treated the water for 240 cents per 1 kilogallon. We sold the treated water back to you for only 50 cents per gallon despite the high cost of treating it at our loss of 190 cents per kilogallon.The post just wants to highlight the hypocrisy of the complaint by Malaysia that untreated water is bought cheaply despite the fact that Malaysia also buys our treated water at a low price."
Much appreciated

"Would like to know how much is resold to Malaysia and how much is used for domestic use to know if Singapore is really treating water for Malaysia at a loss.If SG only resells a small portion back to Malaysia, then SG really isn't getting a bad deal at all.Anyone has statistics?"
"The idea is that SG is providing a subsidized service to MSIA in exchange for cheap price of water. If MSIA wants to renegotiate the price of water, SG will have to renegotiate the subsidy for the service SG provide too.It has nothing to do with how much water we use."
"But you need to quantify the subsidised service to determine the fairness of the deal.Definitely not a simple subtraction like the cartoon right? I think the cartoon is just picking raw simple numbers without looking at the bigger picture, to stir feelings.The value of the subsidised treatment service scales with the volume of water that goes back to Malaysia vs volume of untreated water that goes to SG.Let's just say for the sake of argument, Malaysia sells 100 litres to SG. SG sells 10 litres of the treated water back to Malaysia, 10% of what is sold to SG in the first place. So based on this, the treatment service subsidy only apply to 10% of water being sold in the first place.We win by buying 90% of the water at a cheap price, at a massive discount. They win by buying 10% of the water, treated, at a subsidised priced.If they sell us at a more expensive price, we have to resell them at a more expensive price of course. I'm not trying to deny that at all.Not trying to push a favourable agenda for either MY/SG, just want to see if there are more numbers to show the full story."
"We can draw a maximum of 250m gallons of untreated water and sell back 2% of what we draw. Assuming we max out everyday, the math is (if my calculations are not off):SG pays MY RM7,500 for 250m gallons of untreated waterSG incurs RM12,000 to produce 5m gallons of treated waterMY pays SG RM2,500 for 5m gallons of treated waterSG incurs a loss of RM9,500 for producing 5m gallons of treated water for MY"
"Also to note that in Mahathir's POV, the loss of revenue comes from the Federal Budget. The savings goes back to Johor (money otherwise spent on water is now spent on other stuff). Since the Sultan of Johor and Mahathir have a bone to pick, he's not happy to see the state profit at the expense of the federation."
"Thanks for the numbers. This is definitely a more rational analysis compared to the cartoon lol.It seems like we're providing extremely subsidised rates to treat 2% of the water we draw. This can be considered a big loss on our side, and a big win on their side.We also as a result of this agreement, get to buy water (arguably really cheaply) and use 98% of it. This can be considered a win for our side as we can't live without water and we struck a decent deal, considered a loss on their side because this is really cheap.Win-win imo.If they change the price of water sold to us, we jack up the price of water resold to them. Seems like no matter what we do by reacting to their price hikes appropriately, we should still be in a win-win situation tbh."
"PUB is entitled to draw 250 million gallons of raw water daily from the Johor River under the 1962 Water Agreement with Malaysia, which expires in 2061.In exchange, Singapore is obliged to sell five million gallons of treated water to Johor each day. However, PUB has been regularly providing Johor with up to 16 million gallons of water on a daily basis. The new addition of six million gallons of water daily comes on top of this.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-supplying-more-treated-water-to-malaysia"
"Interesting, it seems like we're actually going above and beyond our original deal by selling back more treated water than we're supposed to. Why would mad hatter want to rock the boat zzzzz"
"Simply put, he has much more to gain if the prices go up across the board.If he can get the prices of water to go up by even one sen, he can easily forgo whatever treated water we are selling him and still make out like a bandit. It's simple math."
"Doesn't that mean that the infrastructure for water treatment in JB has to be good enough already to reduce/completely cut off the reliance of rebuying water from SG?Honestly, it's time for SG to try to diversify its water source too. Never too late to have a back up plan."
"SG has been proactive on this for more than a decade already. Aside from distillation and rain water catchment areas, Newater was introduced in 2002/3 as another ""national tap"" to meet the water needs of citizens. They're already getting water from the air, sea and well, your toilets. There's no water source underground that Singapore can use extensively, unlike Malaysia. Maintaining good bilateral ties between these countries goes towards ensuring harmony and favourable resource sharing. Neither can survive without the other, but that stupid madey is making this personal and rocking the boat because his balls are too big for his grandfather pants."
Singapore has been working on a back up plan for a long long time now
There are water treatment plants all over Malaysia. You are pushing too hard if you assume that Malaysia is somehow so improverished to treat water. Just ask any KL or Penang citizen where their water comes from.
"Not implying that Malaysia is so impoverished that they can't treat water lol.But water shortages still happen from time to time in Malaysia. I know best as I grew up in Malaysia lol. Queued to collect pails of water a few times to bring home to use.There are still times in Johor where water shortage in reserves happen and water bought back from Singapore is used. Obviously, shortages are not a daily thing, but it can still happen."
"It's not about the cost. It's about whether Malaysia has the additional capacity in its existing infrastructure to go without the water treated by Singapore. Last I read at least, it didn't."
They do though. Have you heard any news of any other Malaysia states struggling with clean water?
"used to live in sg ~5 years ago. iirc, based on my monthly bills, i was paying close to sgd2+ per cu m of water.at rm2.40 (sgd0.90) per 1000 gal, the sg gov is indeed selling the same treated water to malaysia at a much much lower price!or did i just make a calculation mistake somewhere? 1000 gal ~ 3.8 cu m."

"Genuinely curious, if msia kp so much about our selling price of water, why can't we just stop selling it to them? They've even made claims that they don't need our water /that the amount they buy from us is negligeble."
There is contract between us.We are to sell them those water

"I got an email reminding me to accept my EAE, yet I still don't have the package? I'm worried I might have thrown it away by accident. Could someone post a screenshot of an example of what one looks like? And what should I do if I did in fact throw it like a buffoon?"
It will look like a giant brown envelope hard to miss. Don’t worry about it. It will come soon. Even when it does come late you’ll still probably have time to complete whatever forms are inside. (Source eae from 2017)
It’s a big brown package/ envelope with your school’s stamp on it. If you actually threw it away contact the school or go there immediate but i’d advice waiting. I received mine really late and ended up rushing for check ups and stuff.
SingPost threw it away?
Just go down to collect. Safe all the hassle of wondering if you threw it away.
Some cars will just keep going so much that it's practically a waste to junk them after 10 years. Those who own a Toyota generally know what I'm talking about - don't know about the hybrids but the gas ones can go pretty long on a single repair.
Read many stories of Priuses lasting for more than 10 years on the original hybrid battery with only the 12V axillary battery needing to be replaced so yup they're quite reliable
"2005 toyota still purring on. Smooth, fuel efficient, and fucking reliable."
My experience with inheriting the driving responsibilities tells me that everything else breaks/needs replacing excepts the parts that make the vehicle go. :3
"SINGAPORE - A record 37,114 certificates of entitlement (COEs) were extended beyond their 10-year lifespan last year - about 20 per cent more than in 2017, the previous record year.The trend was fuelled largely by relatively low certificate of entitlement premiums, which had hovered at their lowest in five to eight years during the year.About 57 per cent of extensions were for cars up to 1,600cc. The rest were for cars above 1,600cc, for which most owners chose a 10-year extension, unlike the other group.Freelance writer Lionel Seah, 62, said extending the COE of his BMW 525i was a ""no-brainer"". He paid close to $38,000 for a 10-year extension, forgoing at the same time the car's scrap rebate of around $28,000.""So it works out to be just over $6,000 per year of depreciation over the next 10 years,"" Mr Seah said. ""If I bought a new 5-series, it would have cost me $250,000 - or an annual depreciation of over $20,000.""That's three times more. It's mind-boggling.""Furthermore, he said his car is still ""running sweet... and creamy"".Besides minor wear-and-tear parts, he said he did not replace anything. ""Surprisingly, there are no cracks or tears on the leather upholstery even,"" he added.Lawyer Sarjeet Singh, 53, topped up the COE on his Mini Cooper S by 10 years last year too, describing it as ""the best decision"" he has made.""This is the last of the supercharged engines,"" he said, adding that its reliability has been ""bullet proof"".Like Mr Seah, he only had to replace wear-and-tear parts like suspension bushings and engine mounts. ""The upholstery is in mint condition,"" he noted.Workshops also saw an uptick in business from motorists who had decided to keep their old rides.Mr Joey Lim, managing director of independent workshop Harmony Motor, said the number of such customers ""more than doubled"" last year.""These cars are usually those with good engines and transmissions,"" Mr Lim said. ""Mostly, the owners will just change all the fluids, shock absorbers and some other undercarriage parts.""The COE renewal trend has contributed to this year's reduction in COE supply, which is determined largely by number of cars scrapped. Observers said if all those who extended COEs had scrapped their cars instead, COE supply would grow, not shrink.Motor traders reckon the number of COE renewals will dip this year if COE prices continue to rise. They also pointed out there are fewer cars reaching 10 years of age than last year - 60,000 this year compared to 80,000 in 2018."

Ah so this is where I heard of it before. Personally I love puzzles so if I'm tackling a complex problem I'd go at it for hours.
"Pomodoro TechniqueThe Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions. Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts.[ ^PM | Exclude ^me | Exclude from ^subreddit | FAQ / ^Information | ^Source ] Downvote to remove | v0.28"
"Find tutorial qn and try to do it. Best is if you have two set, one x manageable and one x difficult (make sure you have solution for both set). Use manageable set to guide you through your reading materials and the difficult set to practise. Try and see if it works."
"I turn my easily distracted tendencies to my advantage. So for example, at the start of the day I tell myself I will finish studying subjects A and B. So I start off with subject A. Then when I don't feel like studying subject A anymore (which could be about 1 page or even half a page later, my attention span sucks balls) I just put it aside and open up subject B. Then when I can't focus on subject B anymore, I go back to subject A. Then when I really really can't think about A or B anymore, I do C, which is extra bc I didn't allocate that for the day. So most of the time I manage to study 2 subjects concurrently, while doing extra at the same time. Short attention span sucks, but if you turn it to your advantage, it can help you go a long way."
unless the deadline for three projects comes at the same time and you have no clue which one to do first and you spend time to plan which to do first and you think oh no Im wasting too much time and you start to do one of the projects and you think oh no what about project 2 and you start project 2 and you think oh no I should do 3 or maybe I should plan yes I should plan that way ill stop thinking and you start to plan but you cannot decide which to do first and you rack your mind for a couple minutes and oh no an hour has passed and you didnt do jack and you freeze up and think oh no oh no and you open reddit to escape from the stress.And you feel at ease...

Which deadline comes first? i know u said same day but which one has the earliest timing? Work on that first. Then do the others later. Or, u can prioritise the one with ur weaknesses first, cos u know u will need more time to do it so u must start earlier. Do the easier ones later. I know it is tempting to do the easier ones first but sometimes u will get too caught up in them and forget all about the harder ones and then u run out of time.Jiayou, u can do dis :D"

"Recently, there was a post made by a user ""hastagelf"" about the treatment of maids in Singapore. I do not believe that his intentions are purely to raise awareness of this topic. Rather, from his comment history, he seems to be trying to tarnish Singapore's image on reddit. Here are screenshots of his past comments about Singapore on another sub-reddit:https://imgur.com/a/d2ZyoafTo quote him: ""...(Singaporeans) feel that they are so inferior to white people that they will spread their assholes and wait for whites to get dicks inside them. Singaporean people's modern culture is to hate themselves and their native culture. They really put white people on a pedestal at the expense of other Asians.""I wonder why he chose to go to NUS if he hates Singapore so much and thinks we're all white-worshippers? His disrespect towards our country makes me angry that people are still debating in good faith with him. He’s no different from those arrogant white people who visited Singapore and 呱呱叫 about simi dictatorship simi human rights."
Not Really.I do wish i have lungs as good as whites since they can talk so loud.But i think Chinese wins hands down on thatHold on. I'm chinese...I guess it's just personality.

"Wah, pass me some popcorn"
lol actually I don't care. Just here for the entertainment. Either he rage or people rage at what he says.
What does him going to NUS have to do with anything? No matter his opinions he is free to study wherever the hell he wants
"No la of course he’s free to study what he wants but he moved to Singapore to study from Malaysia or Bangladesh, enjoys our education and safety and high standard of living, and yet posts such disgusting and slanderous remarks about Singapore. Really ironic. When I said he chose to go to NUS, I didn’t mean out of other schools in Singapore, but the fact that he chose to even come to Singapore when he thinks so little of us."

They take up no space too so that's nice.Decathlon has them right beside each other, so go try out both and see which you feel would see more use."

"Depends how popular the artists are tbh, and what kind of queue system.But if you die die want front row, 2-3 hours should be sufficient"
"they had a sold-out concert when they first came to sg so they are relatively well-knownand,thank you :-)"
"Hm, if they have a large teenage/ young adult fan base, you might want to arrive even earlier, as younger people are more willing to queue, to be absolutely safeHave fun!!"
i guess i shall go early hahathank you. i hope you'll have a great day ahead!

"Lucky I look young enough to say I am still studying inorder to avoid charity. Bro, sorry for lying..."
Actually even if you didn't I think they wouldn't come out and say you're lying. Same difference.
"Seriously peeved. Was collecting stuff from MDS and the counter staff wanted to hold my phone to look at the email. Ok fine, I gave. THEN SHE FREAKING SWIPED TO VIEW MY OTHER EMAILS WTF. Told her to stop and she got upset w me. What even."
Did you complain to her superior? I would.
Dumb bitch lol
I hate it when people do that these days. Their hands are full of germs.
Hate it when F&B staff do that and handle food. Considering so many people pangsai and use their phones....
What? She purposely or what? Maybe she thought there were multiple emails needed for viewing?
"Hi all, as most of you know, I've been collating Singapore's events for r/sg.I'm pretty biased to events that I favour. So I'd like to know if there's certain types of events that you'll like to see more of. Workshops? Finance? Business? Food?All comments and feedback are greatly appreciated!"
social media influencers
I’m sorry I don’t quite understand. Can you elaborate?
There are sometimes events or group meet ups by some local social media influencers
"Ahh I see. That’s interesting. I don’t know many social media influencers, but I’ll keep a look out. If there’s any one in particular you like to follow, feel free to share so I can put it in the thread whenever something pops up. :)"
I will be more interested about the events for the younger crowd and performances from popular comedians/artist coming to singapore
"Thanks for the input, I will keep a look out for those! FYI Jim Gaffigan is coming on March 23rd if you’re interested."
Thanks for the hard work.
That's really nice of you!
"I think any event at all is really helpful, thank you for your contribution!"
anybody planning on getting division 2 on ps4?
Anyone knows how to help a sibling that has become a NEET? My brother has quit his job six months ago and just plays computer games the whole day.
"If he has the financial capability to support himself for the next few months, I think you can let him be. But if he starts mooching and not looking for job at all.. I think you should understand why he quit work and whether he has any motivation to work soon. If he's actually positive on finding work, he'd appreciate your help. Try to find suitable job vacancies and tell him ""hey i think you might be interested"".If not, he'll look at you as a nuisance for reminding him to get job. It's really from himself, dont't think he can pass interviews if he's not motivated at all.Or like the other redditor said just kick him out and give no money lol."
An acquaintance I know hasn't worked a job since he finished uni 10 years back. Parents have been giving him pocket money all this while.
whao i dunno thats a blessing or a curse sia
does he happen to have an elder brother and younger sister? LOL
"Literally force him to be independent. No free money and foods, or even kick him out of the house (with notice) as a last resort. Six months is more than enough time to turn it into a habit, so better start fast."
"If someone hands him money, he will continue."
Did something happen to cause him to quit his job though?
He just said he doesn't like the job due to the toxic enviroment. But I don't think thats a good enough reason to not look for a new job.
Had a friend's brother do that a few years ago and still today no job. The parents complain but he talked back to them saying that he pays for their bills. Overheard that he uses and talks to his computer alot and somehow he makes money from that? Maybe he be a YouTuber or something but that isn't a real job though.
Hi does anyone have an auto private driving instructor to recommend for SSDC? I’ve been checking out online reviews but I find it very strange that those with good reviews are not always those with the highest passing rates....
I love my job but recently dealing with (even more) thoughts of not being good enough and doubting my self and it's affecting me. I want to do do do and there's so much I have / want to do but am so tired of it all. 😢😢
Any other folks can do a AMA? The ex-regular one is prob the most interesting post in this sub for 2019 so far
what are your concrete plans to reduce income inequality
Redditporean here AMA
"Human here, AMA."
hi chinese singaporean here ama
You do lo. We ask you questions.
"today my boss saw that I almost fucked up (in advance) at work and just left me there :”) Idt it’s all my fault but who am I lol. two hours before that another boss randomly talked to me told me “you’ll be okay” and said “this is to encourage you” at the end of itI don’t even need her to tell me I’m good, I just hoped she knows I’ve been trying to do my best all this while"
You're back o.o
kind of. how have you been?
You can do this and you have been doing this 💪💪
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
Hi its me your boss. I know you been trying your best. Don't give up You have came so far with much improvement since day 0 Jiayou ❤️
anyone booked airbnb in singapore before? Can you cook inside the apartment?
Ask the host before booking if cooking is allowed and also ask if there are cooking utensils/equipment in the apartment already.
"My colleague books airbnbs in Singapore solely for that reason. (Because they don't have an oven at home and love to bake). You'll have to look for those who allow cooking, some do, some don't."
"wow, that must be one expensive baking session"
coe increasing.. wonder if gojek has to do with it.
Fresh A level graduate (did As in 2018) and started giving 1 to 1 tuition at JC level for $50/hr - is this cheaper/more expensive than market rate?
I think it's slightly high if you didn't produce results before (having previous tutee who have big jump in grades)
Think it's market rate ah but usually tutors have results to back them up for that rate.
oh haha i just use school results as credentials :’) asking this cos i had like 10+ people who were interested but i only ended up with 2 tutees haha
What subjects do you teach? Can I teach the others that you didn't pick upppp
"Hi guys, so I'm going to be staying in Nanjing in March for over a month and I'm not sure what clothes to get for the weather there (5-15C). My friends say 3 layers should be enough - thinking of getting the uniqlo heattech (normal/extra warm? 3-4 pcs?) as a base layer, then wearing a sweatshirt/shirt and a hoodie over it.Also if any of y'all have been there before, please share the must see/dos/eats! Also the don'ts in China haha."
"Prepare a face mask and a scarf. If there is a strong wind, it might get so cold that your nose and ears will hurt really badly. And I mean, really badly. It's like your ears are falling off or something."
"Download the Baidu Maps app and the Dianping app if you can read Chinese! They’re super useful for navigating places.Put your powerbanks in your hand carry luggage rather than your check-in, and if possible try to use a 10,000mAh one. Anything higher than 20,000 would likely get confiscated by the immigration officer - China is very strict about powerbanks."
Thanks! I don't know Chinese sadly lol.
"Don't take online recommendations for winterwear word-for-word - Singaporeans need to overcompensate because we are acclimatized to 30 degrees. Pack gloves, face wraps, scarfs, etc, and make two layers for your base clothing (i.e without a coat).If possible, research (with Google Maps) on where you will be staying so you won't be completely blur when you reach."
DONT call waitresses/waiters Xiao Jie/ Xian Sheng haha
"from my personal experience(korea, around that temp too) for the first few days i wore uniqlo heattech(extra warm, top amd bottom), cotton shirt, jeans, overshirt, winter jacket and i was still shivering outdoors. but by the 3rd 4th day i acclimatised and could go without overshirt and sub the winter jacket for a normal hoodieone important thing was moisturiser/chapstick. during the first few days the skin on my face literally peeled off when i showered, and everything that went into my mouth burnt my lips loli also had slightly sensitive nose and a handwarmer was helpful especially when i can just cover my nose with my warm fist"
"This plus the thinnest heattech and a normal shirt / tee shirt you would normally wear out is enough for me during 5 degree.For heat tech I suggest you get whatever is on sale, if really too cold then just layer with a hoodie below the down jacket. Remember to get heat tech for your legs also. For socks, go for wool socks. For shoes make sure is those that wind cant penetrate e.g. leather / rubber if you're the type that cant take cold.Most of the time the killer is the wind, if no wind, 5-15c is pretty okay. Also its almost always the finger, toes and ears / face that are cold. Your body should be ok."
Thanks! Do you know if I can get a cheaper down jacket elsewhere?
"Hey,I was just offered a position in a company in singapore for over the summer, and I was wondering what I should know about living there over the summer. I'm an Iranian citizen and study at an ivy in the US. I wanted to know how people would treat me, what experiences should I try to have while there, etc. Also, how would the dating scene be for one of my kind? How do the locals perceive young intern expats?Since what I'm being payed most likely affects my experience, here we go: pre-negotiation, they're paying for my accommodation, tickets and 3k per month on top. (Is it possible to negotiate in Singapore?)"
"It is quite difficult to negotiate for internship positions but 3k is very generous considering they are paying you for accommodation and tickets. The average fresh graduate from local universities receive 3k/month as a permanent employee.(My company pays $2000/month for expat interns, and this is without accommodation or tickets.)"
"Weather is going to be very hot and humid. I don’t think locals would treat you very different / negatively. Maybe the older generation might. Recreationally speaking, there’s nothing really exciting to do here that you can’t do else where. Definitely try the different foods while you’re here, there’s many different cuisines to try. Can’t comment much on dating scene though."
"Be prepped for the weather.it's hot.it's humidyou will never know when it will rain. (never trust the cloud cover)As for negotiations. To be honest, for an intern job you're already getting way above average what local interns even get. Like I belive what the other posters here have mentioned, 3k is kind of the starting pay for quite a few perm job holders here.Recreation wise there is nothing extremely unique to look for here. We have pubs if you're a drinker. We have plenty of food spots for if you're a foodie. (if you're a foodie this place would be heaven for you XD) we have nice parks and plenty of cycling trails all around if you're into nature too.All the best. I hope you have a fun time here on our little red dot here in Asia."

"Went to read some e-articles just now,Saw this shocking news that from May onwards, Okto will no longer be around and will be merged with Channel 5, the channel that seems to be dying over the past few years.This move will also help to improve Channel 5 a lot cause i hate watching some repeated Dr Oz show during midday or some useless shows in the afternoon. I also want sports content like Champions League or some EPL, Bundesliga and etc on Ch 5 in the near future.As the first national channel in SG, they should provide the best content to viewers.I hope to see a new channel replacing that slot, maybe another Malay/Indian channel or a sports channel and etc in the future."
Just seems like yesterday when Kids Central turned into Okto
And vasantham gained independence from then.
Just seems like yesterday Prime 12 turned into Kids Central
"Dammit, went through all that phases"
It's premier 12 turned into kids central.
"I feel old. I still remember watching Neon Genesis Evangelion on Premier 12 when I was a kid, on primetime.Yes. ._."
Were there any animes during arts central ? I remember watching inuyasha and Hellsing around 11pm....
I recalled the times where anime movies like Wolf's Rain and Spriggan used to air on Arts Central at nightGood times
Indeed. Desert punk was awesome too
Prime 12 became Suria.Premiere 12 became Central.
"Yeah sia, 10 -15 years plus watch childhood programmes now felt like it is all gone."
And still no one remembers SportsCentre. RIP.
you just jolted a memory that i thought would never remember.
Was bound to happen at some point in time due to falling viewership.Don’t think they’ll replace it with another channel though. Feel this is purely a cost-cutting measure.I still have fond memories of Arts Central and their 10pm anime slots!
I discovered GetBackers thanks to that slot
D.Gray-Man was dope when I watched it on artscentral
Zero no tsukaima was the shit that dragged me into the rabbit hole and maybe also made me enjoy tsundere...
Shaman king
Inuyasha 💪
Inuyasha!
Mind your language was hilarious
"Geez, I wonder what caused okto’s downfall...I dunno, I don’t like this merge. I grew up watching kids programme as a kid and seeing this dying out saddens me. Seems like kids are more interested in watching cartoons on YouTube or Netflix these days.Same here with Arts Central. It introduces me to more than just anime (even though that’s where I got my start watching mature anime hehe); high art films and independent (local) films that is worth the shot. I guess the internet can make up for it now that it’s ubiquitous at this day and age."
Those Odex unlicensed pirated subbed anime
"Why're they still around, again? ._."
Referring to how they did shady shit back then when Arts Central was still a thing. And still had the gall to sue anime pirates in Sg.
"Did you even read the whole article?I hope to see a new channel replacing that slot, maybe another Malay/Indian channel or a sports channel and etc in the future.Mediacorp was reported as saying that they would return the spectrum used by Okto to IMDA. If they are currently reducing the number of channels, then I am doubtful that another Malay/Indian channel or a sports channel and etc will happen in the near future.I also want sports content like Champions League or some EPL, Bundesliga and etc on Ch 5 in the near future.Delayed, or live? Unless Mediacorp can secure the rights for live matches at a reasonable cost, I am not too confident about that. And since you are on this, I would like to ask that Mediacorp secure rights to the live telecast of some motorsports series like F1, Formula E, World Endurance series, among others. But I seriously do not think that it will happen.Sorry if I seem like I am bursting your bubble, but I do not remember OktoSports being that hardcore. Bundesliga delayed matches, maybe. Live? I don't think so.People still watch Mediacorp in 2019?I do, only for News 5, which is how I knew about this."
There was a SportsCity channel many years ago which became City TV which later closed down
I remember Channel I? Showing our local S leagues games & delayed games.Anyone remember those channels?I still remember channel 5 back then had Martin Yan cooking show at 6am.that was before Channel 5 decided to start airing CNA news.
Yan can cook and so can you?When i was little I thought “Yan Ken Cook is a weird name” 😂
"Yeap.i was still immense at his knife skills especially if you remember him talking about 'how to relax a chicken'.He is a one of a kind chef where he give an explanation of history and most of all,i like his passion about food."
"OK so at its peak, we have the following channelsMediaCorp Channel 5 Channel 8 Channel NewsAsia CityTV (FKA Sportscity) Central SuriaMediaWorks Channel U Channel I (FKA TV Works)"
Makes me wonder what are the cultural and economic differences which makes HK entertainment much better than ours despite both of us are small cities.
"Most cantonese shows are produces in HK, and HKers tend to prefer cantonese.Whereas here, Singaporeans identify most with Singlish, but IMDA wants to promote Good English so the Singlish market is not exploited well enough. And so we turn to foreign media instead of the watered down, PC, “official” version of local culture Mediacorp likes to push at us."
Just stating from my perspective only bro
miss the times when I watched random tamil shows because shared channel
Kids Central > Vasantham > Art CentralI used to watch cartoons and stayed on after too. I actually picked up a bit of Tamil lol. I now also work in the art/creative industry. COINCIDENCE?
"Yeah sia, especially from tea break time till at night got indian shows"
"This move will also help to improve Channel 5 a lot cause i hate watching some repeated Dr Oz show during midday or some useless shows in the afternoon.Instead, you get to watch kids shows now."
People still watch Mediacorp in 2019?
"狮城六点半 lor, after that switch to other movie channels"
Just to watch my Qin Kai
People still watch Mediacorp TV in 2019?
I see kids these days watch shows on their iPad. 90s kids like me cannot relate. Watch TV shows with my family on Saturday morning was great times.
I remember being quite amazed that on-demand TV became a thing a while back.Now I just Netflix.
"Today's generation of kids damn gifted sia. Got phone can watch a ton of shows already, just press and it will play."
Ah memories of waking up on time just to catch digimon at 9am on chl8. Now it's really just a few taps on screens to watch everything
And dont think there will be a new channel anytime soon. Suria/vasantham are not broadcasting on weekday morning.
omg people still watch free to air mediacorp channels
I remember when they first announced kids central would become okto... got that lenny with the big ears while watching galactic football or some shit
"wow, where would i be able to watch my OKTO ORIGINALS /s"
OKTO RIGINALS(softer) okto riginals
"Only Toggle, bo pian unless they remove the whole okto category from toggle lah but i don't think they will do that though."
"As the first national channel in SG, they should provide the best content to viewersoh honey...."
Okto is a channel that i accidentally watch it for few sec when trying to switch channel of the TV. I think for the past few years I might have contribute a total of 5 mins viewing time to Okto.
At least better than nothing😂
"I just want Arts Central back. OK, just the 11pm-12am timeslot, really, but still..."
"When I was still watching TV I kind of like the 'artsy', independent, sometimes non-English films that they would broadcast late at night."
"Even kids are realizing our local tv series are horrible, especially when internet is so freely available."
Yeah. Most of the local shows from other Mediacorp channels doesn't attract much viewers except Chinese dramas on Ch 8.
What's a TV?
"I heard it's like a monitor which automatically broadcasts shows, but doesn't allow you to pick and choose its content."
A tool to watch your favourite programmes
You sound like a Mediacorp advertisement😏
haha not really😂
Uh hoping for football would be wishful thinking... Theres no way Mediacorp would show football regularly considering the price Singtel pays to telecast matches....
"Well it is expected, their airing shows on okto are not on par with old shows in the past. In the past, there are actually anime aired that is suitable for teens and youth? There are actually real teens and youths watching okto/kids central in the past, then came the local kids shows on okto during my teens, i just turn towards smartphones and ipad.But these days only aired local kids programme and a handful of overseas kids content. I think in the past, channel U also aired Tsubasa chronicles in the afternoon? These days channel U just aired the same family korean drama from the previous broadcast?Even channel 5 shows are mostly local content? Can't we get overseas shows like Game of thrones, sherlock holmes 2010 bbc version, supernatural etc?"
I hear that you can now watch HBO shows like games of thrones on toggle due to the partnership of mediacorp and HBO go.
Okto is fking useless pls. Bring back Kids Central :(
"KC content last time was much better than current okto, repeat a programme 3 times per day wth"
"Images of early Singapore come alive in ST bicentennial videoThe scene that greeted Stamford Raffles and William Farquhar when they arrived, preserved in the earliest surviving drawing of Singapore.One of the first photos of the view from the historical Fort Canning Hill, where Raffles had a house.These are some of the rare images from as far back as 1819 that come to life in a special video by The Straits Times to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Singapore's founding.Launched this month, it is the first of six in a video series on Singapore's bicentennial year with the theme ""200 years in 200 seconds"".Other highlights in the video include the founding of the Botanic Gardens in 1859; the opening of the Suez Canal, establishing Singapore as a key trading post, in 1869; and Singapore's first National Day Parade in 1966.Also captured are more solemn episodes, such as the fall of Singapore to Japan in 1942, and the race riots of the 1960s.The series is a collaboration between ST's video team, picture desk, and heritage and community correspondent Faith Melody Zaccheus.Old images come alive in the video through the use of cinemagraphs, but the process was no easy feat.""The animation work for each photograph took time, as painstaking detail was needed to bring a static image to life,"" said acting video editor Yeung E-Von.PAINSTAKING WORK The collections are vast, so it took time to comb through the various categories of photos. And it was also challenging to find historical photos that dated to specific milestones. STRAITS TIMES CHIEF PHOTOGRAPHER JOYCE FANG""Motion animation work included etching out visuals like people and objects in the foreground, separating the image into several layers, and creating motion effects like camera movement,"" she added.Visual effects, such as a billowing column of smoke coming out of a moving train, or trees swaying in the wind, helped to add movement and realism to the photographs, said Ms Yeung.The motion graphics work was done by designer Alexis Gabrielle.The video took about three months to complete, as producer Olivia Chang worked with Ms Zaccheus to highlight the milestones across 200 years of Singapore's history.Related Story 200 years in 200 seconds: Images of early Singapore come alive in ST bicentennial video seriesThey worked with ST's chief photographer Joyce Fang to search for the corresponding photos to tell the story visually, and some of these photos took a month or two to be sourced and approved for use, said Ms Yeung.Ms Fang, who was in charge of sourcing the photos, went through the online photo collections at the National Archives of Singapore and the National Heritage Board (roots.sg), as well as the archives of Singapore Press Holdings.""The collections are vast, so it took time to comb through the various categories of photos.""And it was also challenging to find historical photos that dated to specific milestones - for example, a Malay kampung in the 1800s,"" she added.For events that were impossible to pair with photos, the team turned to paintings and postcards, said Ms Fang.The video team, which has more than 20 people, has been ramping up video production and experimenting with different formats, from platform-specific video content such as Facebook live shows to documentaries to short news packages.In the coming weeks and months, five more videos will be launched in this bicentennial series, covering iconic buildings, heritage foods and fashion.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"
"For the record, I can't be certain this is a Singapore issue, but I've seen it happening amongst some Singaporean friends.So, the reason I say this is because I've had friends who hadn't found a job for months, and they just seem to die die want the perfect well paid job, and then in between they kept complaining how they have very little money when they are perfectly able to find odd jobs in between their interviews to sustain instead of just doing nothing at home. I get it, job hunting is stressful and time-consuming, but it doesn't take so much time in a day. Like hell, you said you got no or very little money, so why not just do whatever part time jobs you can find meanwhile? At the end of the day you have extra money you can use meanwhile.Is this a pride issue?"
"I finished 3.5 years in uni in December 2016. Spent the bulk of 2017 looking for a job and doing internships. I did 2 in companies I really wanted to join, but couldn't convert. Fine. Spent 3 weeks doing nothing and the anxiety got to me so I signed to work in an industry I didn't particularly care about but thought I could handle. Some experience is better than none, right?Well I quit that company 3 months later without having secured a new job. I found out that sometimes employers are just bad, don't want to admit it, and blame workers for being picky.If you are tight on finances, and I mean tight (in debt because of student loan, need to pay rent, savings running out rapidly, no family to borrow from) then yes it is super important to land a job first and keep yourself stable. However, if you keep your expenses low to less than few hundred a month, and you're willing to wait, I say just wait for a good one. Not a perfect one because there's no such thing, but one that you might some sort of relief for having joined. I managed to get by a year with internship allowance and found a job I really liked, where the employer valued me and gave me opportunity. I'm still here and am not thinking of quitting anytime soon.Of course, if you stay unemployed for more than 1.5 years you're definitely thinking or doing something wrong lah."
Care to share what industry are you in?
Commodity trading. But I perform a corporate function so my industry doesn't really matter.
"When I was fresh grad, I was jobless for quite some time. So I took on the first job (a contract job) that offered. Big mistake. The place is a shithole. And to escape the shithole, I started looking for other jobs but I was limited in many ways e.g. I cannot take leave as when I like to go for interviews (even unpaid ones). Fortunately, my second job was not much a shithole as the first one with Better pay and benefits AND a perm role.Advice to all fresh grads: Take your time if you can afford to."
"Same here yoAnd the shit hole still has the cheeks to say my job is hotly wanted by ppl out there. She's right, and ppl literally quit even faster than the duration I stayed."
"I'd like to add on that taking your time also means you should be doing meaningful work on the side to explain resume gaps. Too long a gap and it becomes a massive red flag.Acceptable side work includes attending courses, freelance projects, voluntary work related to field, and more. (May I note that these are also networking opportunities that can help in the job search.) Not taking your time to surf reddit while waiting for companies to respond to you and a hundred others."
lolI would say employers are spoiled. Most job seekers I know send out literally hundreds of applications DAILY.
"Yeah I agree. Employers want a unicorn worker, (cheap, does an exceptional job, totally committed to work, etc).It's an exploitative country and people we have."
"What’s worse - jumping into another shit hole for fear of remaining jobless for too long, searching for your ideal job and having an ever-widening gap in your resume that you will find it hard to explain later or accepting a smaller role/pay compared to your last and have recruiters judge you later on for that?"
Need to set a time frame.
"Yes. And the higher up you are in the chain, the waiting time gets longer. I’ve seen candidates above $10k taking cuts of up to $3k after waiting for 6 months. It’s not that they are picky, but that the process is much longer at that level."
"Finding a job has become just as much about career-building as earning a living. People hear stories about illustrious careers of all shapes and sizes, be it a strong climb up a corporate or government ladder, comfortable stability in a stable niche, cross-industry experience that led to a coveted executive role, or leadership in a new business. It’s come to a point where people feel the need for each job they take to play a role in the story they want to tell about their life; career defines us. Consequently people are more picky about what they want have to end up defining their identity. What we don’t see is that there’s plenty of unglamorous parts of these high profile careers that aren’t told, just like in social media."
There are people that believe that taking a lower offer affects your asking pay for next job.
"It's absolutely the case because employers are very chao kuan here. Standard practice is to offer maximum 15-20% over your last drawn pay.Also, low pay also limits how much you can get after promotions, etc."
"So it's a matter of who can hold out for the position longer. Spoilers: it's the company.While you said makes sense, if the jobless period is very long, your potential gains would have been lost by the time you get a job. If that makes sense"
So it's a matter of who can hold out for the position longer. Spoilers: it's the company.Depends on how hot your industry is. My ex boss recounted a recent tale where an exec from a large MNC employer was very upset because their HR didn't move fast enough and offer enough and she went somewhere else.
Not to mention there are new graduates entering the workforce every year. The company just have so many choices when it comes to new hires.
"What would you think would be the breakeven point, though? I hear people have a v low opinion of people staying only 1-2 years at their prev job, and if you're angling to get at least two pay increments over your initial offer, wouldn't you say giving yourself 3 months or so for a job search be a good bet?"
"Depends.If every 1-2 years your new job shows you have taken on bigger roles and handled them successfully then I think it shows you are very talented. That's how the top people get poached and move around.OTOH if you are just moving around different companies while performing similar job scope then it doesn't look so good.I think for millenials, 1-3 years is ideal unless your company is already paying top dollar and you are still learning stuff. In fact if you are really good moving from company A-B-back to A in a senior role can score you a huge bump over colleagues who stayed."
"Ok there are many factors to consider. Such as your financial status. Fresh grad vs someone who has worked for a few years. Financial obligations etc. I think with the current job market, 3 months might be too short.As for staying for only 1-2 years, my senior at my first job used to change jobs every 3 years. Due to the nature of the industry, that was the best way to get a decent increment."
"I know people who have never gotten their ""potential gains"" in the years that they've worked for the company as there is no annual increment. This is actually more common than you think it is, although yes, if your salary is high enough it won't matter.And unfortunately, people who look at annual increments... typically do so because what they're working for isn't market rate.Edit: in any case, there is no bigger loss than the dead end of trying to solo maintain a system nobody uses and your company is decidedly trying to get rid of for years. The loss isn't monetary, it's getting your career deadlocked and your skills becoming irrelevant. It's up to you to choose to do this in a job, or sitting at home jobless."
"Also what you said about potential gains is debatable.Assuming a constant annual wage growth, your lifetime loss of a 10% pay cut is 10% of your end of career salary. Assuming you start at 2k a month and end your career at 16k a month, you will lose 12k upfront by waiting 6 months for a 2.2k job but more than make up for it by getting roughly 18.7k more in your last career year so net profit of 6.7k over your lifetime. Figures are much more if the pay differs by 20% or more.Edit: the math is definitely very wonky but if you formalize it you can come up with scenarios where you come up on top"
"In what cases do people realistically start at 2.2k and end at 16k, though? LOL"
"Auditors of my generation seem to be following that trajectory, although obviously there would be divergence in income depending on career paths, with the higher end ending much greater than 16k."

"with audit, EY used to start at 2.4k years ago but if you make partner even at a smaller firm you will clear 300k easily by your 40s.And if you are a DD in civil service you will definitely draw 200k total comp especially near retiremenOnly in certain industry can U make that jump. Vast majority of pple starting at 2.2K can only dream to see 10K at the end of their career"
That's assuming that increments from both companies are the same. Which may not necessarily be the case. Promotion prospects could also be different
"Ya it's just a random model la. But it's not just simply pay, also growth opportunities. Taking 6 months to a year off to prep for FAANG interviews will pay off handsomely if you know you are of the caliber to score a job there. They probably pay 40-60% more than most competitors and you will be in a whole new league after.If you have chance to do high visibility/high growth projects, brand name, it's also worth waiting or taking lower pay.My friend jumped from audit big 4 to investment banking by getting himself into M+A projects. Went from 3+k to 11k overnight when he moved."
But I do get what you mean. It is possible to come out with a net gain by waiting.
Flawless logic. While having no job and no money increases their bargaining power through the power of reverse psychology?
I dunno. I know that I took a pay cut from my first to second job after being jobless for a while but I got much better work life balance. Also my pay caught up soon after
"Or having your first job in a small, unsexy SME like “Lee Huat Aluminium Trading Pte Ltd.” I think it does affect your next job prospects in some way."
Rubbish. Having some work experience is more impressive than none. Having x amount of months/years in x company will be more eye catching on a resume than a big fat nothing.
If you’re fresh outta uni I say be a bit choosy la. But if it has been a year and you still cant find anything then you should probably settle for lower.
"Employers are actually spoilt for choice today, not job seekers. See my post history. Even if I were to exclude frequent fears of landing in a role that I certainly am not suited for, expect good companies to have a 4-step interview process and show preferences right on the day they read your application. In other words, expect to be ghosted - life's like this.Also, IME, there's a potential opportunity cost of blindly taking the first offer you get. I'm ok with not being choosy only to a certain extent, but in this day and age when you can be let go for any reason, and you can be rejected out the gate for any reason, and hell - you can even accept a job only to find yourself doing something else entirely - you may as well go for broke."
"Haha it used to be the other way round in the 90s. I remember job hopping was a big issue and the newspaper used to talk about it. But I guess with more options for labour, it has become an employers' market"
"Heh, I was around back then! All the complaints stopped as soon as the Asian Financial Crisis hit. After that it was no longer fashionable to expect an iron rice bowl, so complaining about job hopping became one of the signs you haven't moved with the times yet. :3"
Think a lot of the redditors here are too young to know how things were back then.
The job market is not exactly in favor of employees now. Employers are spoilt for choice and are able to lowball employees. Haizzzz
I can't even recall the last time it was an employee's market.
i actually think people need to be more picky and selective. every time i kind of 'settled' for a job because i just wanted to get a job it's turned out badly - i knew i made the wrong move within a month of starting the job. ignoring gut feeling and red flags because of the social pressure to be employed never ends well.
"Personally, I also think companies need to adapt with the times. I feel a lot of the practices (demanding your last drawn salary, expected salary and photo) are very outdated. Salary should be something discussed and negotiated upon completion of job interview and during offer of employment. Having it on the resume just gives the employer too much power and leeway and undercuts job seekers too much (to me this is also a red flag - an employer looking to hire the cheapest possible person for the role, not necessarily the best fit or best candidate). Most of the big companies have an idea of what they are paying people for that role.Searching through a lot of the ads on jobstreet, I find a lot of them are reluctant to be upfront about their information and some companies are sketchy in that their official website has little to no information and Google does not even return results. This also further deters me and be more selective with application process as they use a lot of misleading titles (Wealth Relationship Manager/Financial Advisor - when in reality if you look deeper it is Insurance and not a Wealth Management role).Granted, I am speaking from the place of a jobseeker (and maybe I am biased) but these are certain red flags for me that make the process longer."
"Salary should be something discussed and negotiated upon completion of job interview and during offer of employment.I agree you shouldn't have last drawn and expected salary on the resume. But I don't agree with disclosing your salary and discussing salary expectations only until after the interview has concluded i.e. contract negotiation stage.I'd be upfront about giving them a range for my last drawn salary and salary expectations, but I will never express these figures in absolute terms. I don't want to reach the end of the interview only to know that they cannot afford to pay me at that rate asked."
Good point! I hadn't thought about that but definitely will keep that in mind
"If the interview went well, i will suggest to talk about pay package.It is actually the best time to nego.The HR / admin calling you to offer won't be the one to approve your package.You have to convince the interviewer that you are worth it."
"Except for small companies, salary is almost always not determined by hiring manager even if the person interviewing.On the contrary, it’s HR that does that. For every role, there is a salary range which is determined by market research into similar roles in region. If the requested salary goes above that, HR will have to clear with division VP and finance. For very senior roles, the board of directors make the call.Furthermore, for more professional orgs, you’ll need to go for 3 or more rounds of interviews depending on seniority. I went thru 5 rounds for my current role and my most recent hire went thru 7 rounds. Compensation is never discussed until all interviews are concluded.Discussing compensation during my interview is an immediate red flag and definitely not a good idea. Except maybe for sales and related roles. Those guys are coin operated."
"Actually i find that it's the big ones that's harder to nego more than their budget.Because big ones will always have more HR policies and less flexible.It is also a experience that with backing of the interviewer, it is easier to nego. Which is why I will choose myself to bring up the topic."
"Some of these ""part-time"" are not really part-time at all. Worked at a f&b chain for 6 days a week while waiting for my NS. And you dont get to choose your rest day obviously. I was planning to quit after 3 months, but the conditions are not that good and i decided the meager salary is a poor utilization of my time. So i handed in a resignation letter to my manager 2 weeks early as an advance notice as per company protocol.Two weeks later when i am leaving, the other manager asked told me i have to pay the company for 2 weeks in damages if i dont come tomorrow because i did not give the company advance notice.I told him what transpired and he told me not to worry, he would handle it. So believed him i did and it was dumb of me. The month ended and not only was i not paid a single cent that month, they demanded i pay them in damages instead for the two weeks i worked.Long story short, a lot of priviledges we enjoy, like the cheap food and services come at hidden social costs. Underpaid labour and bullying of employees sound so far until you experience it. It was a company with a good reputation that i would not name.I say, you can do part time, you can spend your time more productively. JUST DONT GO INTO A FORMAL WORK CONTRACT. There are devious people hidden in plain sight here in singapore, hidding their ugly faces behind false smiles and business suits"
"Dude, you should report them to MOM. How come the 2 managers never communicate with each other? They dont see eye to eye or the second manager doesnt ""like"" you? You did nothing wrong, and by law you should be paid for the hours worked, no matter how little."
That's why whistleblowers exists.
"Wow, that sucks. So did you end up paying?"
Chances are they probably deducted from the pay he accrued from hours worked
"Did you read your contract? If things occurred according to the terms of the contract, then so be it, you should have known. But if as you said they did not pay you despite you adhering the the contract terms, you are letting yourself get trampled upon by not enforcing your rights."
Yeah the second half of the story is i called the manager back and had him on recording on my phone. Then talked to the company.It was a hectic and tiring experience i do not wish for anyone else. Stay away from f&b people
"I might be a little biased here, but I believe so.I know this one person who's nearing thirty. Got money to smoke, drive, makan good food and jiak hong overseas.Never finish his private diploma (which he borrowed money for), never give parents money. Never save money, apparently doesn't care about electricity/water usage at home. Always like to invest in some weird small business ventures because ""tiagong from friends can earn a lot of money"".Changed jobs four times in less than six months. Stopped doing PHV cos ""don't like people to slam my door"". Stopped working at various places because everyone ""target/針對 me"".Every day kpkb about what got no money lah, share anti-government posts on FB, complain about falling out with whoever suay suay that day quarrel with him.There are literally a shit ton of jobs that he can do, he resigned (because of his pride) from various jobs that's actually offering him significantly higher salaries than what's being offered for his qualifications (N levels).He could be earning so much more but he wants ""face""."
"Seen far too many ppl jumping at the first job opportunity due to inexperience or fear that they might not land a job. But ended up getting underpaid in a company with poor finances, culture and little to no prospects. It's easier said that done to switch to another job after u spent months learning the ropes in the company and building relationships. Some have guilt so they drag it out but the longer they drag the longer it snowballs. And they ended being more stressed than they need to be. So it's not wrong to be careful even for a first job. I've seen ppl who have found the right first job and did it for many years.P.s. tldr it's possible to find that good first job even though it might take some time. But if u have the mentality to take any job that comes ur way or that u could change another job if u don't like it. U will end up wasting more time jumping here and there and it will be more like odd jobs than a career. I'm shld we have seen friends that change their jobs every few years with little to no increment in pay or position. And the worse is to switch industries frequently. It's better to be good at one job then to be half-fked for many."
"Time is an opportunity cost. Are you spending time to do something that will be beneficial to your career, or something that is congruent to your future career goals?Let's say you get into a job that doesn't make good use of your skills. 3 years down the road when you go for interviews, the hiring manager says, ""you haven't done this for 3 years. Are you sure you remember how to do/we prefer someone who has been in the industry all along.""For young grads, I would advise to take whatever because your first job may not be what you wanna do for the rest of your life. But for second career people, it is important to consider the bigger picture."
"personally, it depends on what offer they rejected"
"From an employer's perspective: If someone is being picky while holding on to a stable fulltime job, that's an understandable career move. If someone is jobless and nitpicking, then that person had better be the damned best at his/her role.From a personal perspective: Every month you go without an income is a whole lot of thousands that could have been yours. I can't imagine any job being so bad that I'll throw away a few thousand a month over it. Find a new job if the current one turns out to suck, but keep at it until you land the new job. It gives you more leverage anyway."
Good point.Next time someone ask if they should quit without a job ready just use this.Do you want to throw away few thousands every month?
"my peer group and i have been working around the 1 - 3 year experience mark. most of us have no liabilities - i.e. parents still healthy, no big wedding plans, no kids, no debt/student loans paid off.from what i see, my peers who are trying to find jobs now are mainly people who want to leave their industry/jump into a different field altogether. a lot of them continue to stay (unhappily) employed wherever they are because the social pressure of staying employed outweighs idk taking a chance (either getting additional education/training to help w the transition, taking a pay cut, etc).until then, they bitch all day about hating their jobs but when asked what they're (actively) doing about it, the best they can think of is ""i dunno"".also idk if it's just me but almost everyone i know who signed onto MOE? is like that lol which is kinda sad."
"Every new employer will ask how much you were paid in the last job and price you based on that. Taking a pay cut will hurt you, possibly for life.Although prolonged unemployment is bad, if you accumulate multiple short tenures of 3-4 months, that's a massive red flag and nobody will ever bother interviewing you againThe lowest paid jobs often are also the most demanding. I work in IT. Most interviews are technical tests that I wont pass if I dont prepare. Being unemployed is fine if you can fruitfully do self training... esp for many jobs that require the latest tech that nobody actually use in real work yet.There was a period of time my father kept demanding huge amount of money. Being unemployed shut him up. Dont be so eager to judge. Everybody has their stories you know nothing about."
Yes it's a pride issue. Many look at the 'fresh grad' wages and try to exceed it because everyone thinks they're better than average.Personally know many 'aspiring investment bankers' who were jobless for months before taking up a banking position
"I personally do not see this being an issue. Reason being, it is a perfectly fair Demand and Supply system.If the organisation you are applying for does not think you are a good fit, it is seen as normal for them to be able to reject your application. Why therefore would it be wrong for the applicant to make his/her own choice on which jobs to opt for?It is a free economy out there."
I recently took an internship that paid way too little and I ended it after 4 months. I figure I’d rather look a little longer for something that is more worthwhile than “settle” for the first offer I get.
Internships are not meant to pay well -- some do but it's a bonus. They are for gaining experience and assessing work life in that company. The real goal is always to get that one foot into their door if you perform well and like that place.
I don't want to reveal too much but it was way below the usual 600-700 for internships. Yeah I wasn't learning much as well and the boss was a big micro-manager.
"Started the year planning to work 5 months until my enlistment. January pasts, still no job. Finally got one mid February as a packer. Til now, I don't know what part is the packing part. Literally all we do is non stop sorting and dismantling of iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks. After day 2 I felt like quitting and found myself asking ""what on Earth am I doing here?"" The job would be ok if it paid more. But it only pays 7.50 per hour. That's not a lot for a non stop work type of job. I could earn more at Tori Q and not work as much. The only thing helping me to survive is my co workers. Obviously they were also looking for part time job and landed here. Most if them are around my age also (17-18). This job is far from the ideal job so I don't think for most singaporeans, they are picky about what job they get"
"Not my turn yet but my partner's facing a similar issue recently.Initially, I thought he was being picky about the job scope and salary; but he brought up a good point since he spent 1.5 years trying out another field. To him, even though there were skills that he learnt, but that 1.5 years could also have been spent working somewhere that can contribute to minimum years of experience that so-called entry level jobs required.Guess the way he thinks is a little different cuz he knows he can take up part-time jobs in between but he's so fixated on making sure that he finds a job before he finishes serving his current notice."
"Most of the comments here have disproved that this is just merely a pride issue. What made you come to this conclusion, OP? Have you spoken to your friends and tried to understand more as to why they are doing that?but it doesn't take so much time in a daywell I do not think this is true. Applying for jobs blindly by spamming your resume to every potential employer is easy for sure. But you have to know that people do have to spend time looking at the potential company's background, culture and for some, reviews on glassdoor. These are all time consuming."
"MOM, is that you?"
Singaporeans are so spoiled that they have to find part time jobs instead of looking forever for full time jobs. https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/9-10-graduates-employment-within-235624741.html

"Hi everyone! Hope you all are having a great day! I'm currently a year 2 undergraduate in NUS FST and I'm intending to undertake an internship during the summer period to gain some exposure and experience in the field. I tried applying at abbott for a nutrition science internship as well as their other R&D projects, but unfortunately, they only accepted applicants who were able to commit for at least 6 months.Hence, I would like to ask if anybody working in this field has any advice on which companies are open and good options for having a summer internship? I would really love to gain some exposure before hand. Thanks in advance!"
then commit 6 months! tell them that you are able to commit 6 months. get your foot in the door first. it's always possible to take a semester off school or to take a day of work for classes. question is how much work are you willing to put in.
I don't think the problem is the relationship.The problem is the complete stranger being introduced to and feeding a five year old without a family member being around.
"Yeah I would say that too.The problem is the complete stranger being introduced to and feeding a five year old without a family member being around.This part is definitely unacceptable.But if you look at the comments of the post, you can see all these 'employers' saying that they would immediately fire their maids if they had boyfreinds. regardless of whether or not they met with their kidsLike why do they have say over this?it almost seems scarily like these maids are somehow their 'children' that they need to have total control over."
"Because maids might bring their boyfriends home to fuck while everyone is out. On your bed. True story, happened to one of my ex-colleagues. She had to throw out her king-sized mattress and buy a new one because gross.Also when I was younger I lived near a landed cluster and taxis would queue up all afternoon outside one unit, turns out the maid was whoring herself when the owners were out at work."
End of the day it's about trust on both sides. The employer is inviting a complete stranger in and the maid is living with a bunch of strangers. I'm sure there are employers who trust their maids enough to have bfs but that doesn't happen overnight
"Singaporeans have a habit of dehumanizing our ""foreign workers."" Families tend to treat maids as an object or tool — notice the linguistic giveaways, evident in this thread no less: we ""have"" or ""own"" maids.I wonder why sex/relationships so discomfits so many. Is it because of the “security risk”? If so, then her dating outside of the home shouldn’t be a source of bother. Is it because it reminds you that maids are human like you and I, equally capable and hungry for love and affection? Are you imagining that Maria over there is going to go from stroking another man’s cock to folding your PT shirt? Why is strict chastity expected? They’re maids — not priests!I beg my fellow Singaporeans — treat them like you'd treat any one of us. How about this for an exercise: Imagine if, instead of serving NS, someone packed you off to the United States to be a house servant for 2 years. How would you want to be treated?"
"I think if the maid gets pregnant, the employer will need to pay or something"
"It’s not so much about maids having sex, but the associated risks that comes with them having sex.They need a place to have sex. There are cases where maids brought their partners to the employers’ home to have sex while their employers are out (free and convenient). These partners then either took stuff, or came back with others to burglar the house now that they know where the employer stay and the valuables they might keep at home.Should a pregnancy result from the trysts, the liability is entirely on the employers. Our law forbade maids or Low income foreign workers to get pregnant and give birth locally, so they will have to be deported. Employers have to bear the medical cost, cost of flight plus the termination fee that the agency will charge.You can be a humanist bleeding heart, but nobody wants to take the unwanted risk when safety and money is involved."
"Imagine if, instead of serving NS, someone packed you off to the United States to be a house servant for 2 years. How would you want to be treated?The NS comparison is really quite inappropirate. Unlike conscription, being a maid is ultimately a job and a choice. Yes, one is free to conduct one's life however they want, but that doesn't mean employers have to accomodate you. For example, if a SAF regular enjoys waking up late at 11am everyday. No one is saying he should be forced to wake up at 0530 against his will. But seeing as working for the SAF requires him to fall in at 0600, he needs to either find a new job or start waking up on time.The fact that there is no shortage of people who want to work here as FDW indicates that the tradeoff is clearly still worth it for many."
""
"""do you HAVE kids?"" i dont think people think of kids as things here...Maids having bfs is fine. But it introduces an unknown. What if theres a bad breakup? What if your kids are used as an emotional blackmail? What if the maid has a bad judgement of character? Can the maid ensure 100% that her private and work life stays apart?"
"Even if they're the child, parents shouldn't have that much say over who the kids date. If you have a problem with the bf/gf, bring it up with the kid, and talk it over.The kid should still have the final say."
I think it's a legacy issue.https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-replies/2011/5000-security-bond-not-forfeited-if-maids-get-prIt used to be that the 5000 dollars bond got confiscated if the maid became pregnant
"This happened to someone I know, maid had a secret boyfriend, a bangla construction worker, and she got pregnant. Maid actually run away herself but if not she would have been sent home on the spot."
wait but where can she go? Her passport will be with the employer right?
What? Do Singaporean employers actually cofiscate passports?
"Most do because if the maid is to run off, the employer will have to forfeit the $5000 bonds or at least half of it. The employer is also required to make effort to locate the maid at his own cost.Imagine your employer has to pay a sum of money to MOM and spend time tracking you down if you decided not to appear for work tomorrow without notice. They have also no way of suing you for breach of contract. I'm sure your employer will have similar measures too.MOM should remove the need for the bond. The excuse that it is to prevent abuse of foreign worker is not even valid. We have law for that."
They keep the passport. The maid has their employment pass and/or a photocopy of the passport I believe. In case the maid runs away.
It is not allowed to take their passportedit: Source; MOM
That’s some medieval garbage mentality. Wtf
""
"They're not allowed to, but many still do."
give this guy a medal.a lot of the problems with maids being treated this way are legacy issues.
"But that doesn't in any way excuse ""modern"" slaveholders."
not making excuse just saying that historical reasons create social norms and force people to take certain actions
"Wow, why was that even a law in the first place?This seems like some real ""The Handmaid's Tale"" shit, but like the opposite."
Not sure. Some might also be concerned that the maid will bring the bf back when they aren't in.
That's certainly a very valid concern
"That's certainly a very valid concernNot only a concern, but very much a reality. I have family members who have on more than one occasion had their helper bring back their partners for extra curricular activities. A couple even got caught in the act. Happy for them to get it on at a transit hotel, but I think at home is a little too close for comfort."
"In singapore, I felt many employers have this mindset of wanting to have a strict control of their maid. As they have put in huge investment in hiring a maid and retaining them to a point of wanting to isolate the maid from the sociality to prevent them from getting ""bad influence"". I have a friend who was unhappy when their maid make new friend with other maid around the neighbourhood and was considering withholding their passport from them."
Might be because employers are afraid of pregnancy cos they have to bear the medical costs and deal with the situation? Also might not be comfortable with a guy they don't know interacting with their kid?In any case FDW is somewhat different from a regular employee because of the intimate nature of the job. It's important for both sides to be comfortable for the relationship to work.If the one party is uncomfortable then it's probably best they find someone else.

"I have to say your comments are all extremely naive. You must be a young teenager/ adult who's read too much about having human rights and other sjw stuff on Twitter, and judging people who do the sensible as the unethical.To be a maid in singapore, they do undergo strict training and tests before they are allowed to work here. For us to trust a stranger in our house, it's actually a very big deal, and the maid will benefit from the financial benefit greatly by working here, so she has incentive to not abuse that trust.Having a boyfriend influences that dynamic alot. The boyfriend, firstly, has not went through any stringent checks or tests to have dated her. A person in love can have her mind influenced. The maid could be influenced to be allowed into the house, and the boyfriend could steal items without even the knowledge of the maid. He has, after all, nothing that he owes to the maid, or the household. In households with young children, who knows if the boyfriend from another country will change his desires upon seeing something else he likes?The maids are here to work, and if the employer has strictly made it clear that seeing someone else is not allowed, that is totally fine. It's not only maids, companies can have regulations against people in the same department having relationships. It's not out of line to stop employing someone if their personal relationships can potentially affect their work, and it is 100% applicable to these maids."
"One of the most mature comments out there.It's the reality of things. A lot of people in this thread have utopian ideals where we should have intrinsic faith in humanity, but that risk simply can't be taken when it comes to family.Last year, my cousin hired a maid to look after his newborn child. The maid ended up getting a boyfriend, and my cousin made the mistake of trusting in her and let her be.The boyfriend turned out to be a good for nothing and my cousin's maid (possibly unknowingly) ended up borrowing money for him from loan sharks, putting down my cousin's address and details for the loan shark to take down.When the boyfriend failed to pay, the maid kept silent about the entire thing and my cousin only found out after the loan sharks came up to his doorstep to seek payment. It was a frightening ordeal and the maid put his ENTIRE family in danger just because of her stupid boyfriend.When it comes to family, nothing else matters more than their safety. We ultimately must realise that you can't just blindly trust in a stranger at the expense of your family's well-being."
"This is exactly why. I wrote it in my reply below. House is your safe haven, imagine you trusted her, she let her bf a complete stranger into your house when you are not at home. This bf then makes a copy of your house keys and now has access anytime to your house. When it comes to a total stranger as in a maid, I prefer not to choose blind faith. You just can't trust an outsider."
"who knows if the boyfriend from another country will change his desires upon seeing something else he likes?Boy, that is messed up.."

"If I am not wrong, if the maid run away with the guy. Employers have to bear the penalty and plus if she is pregnant, they would also have to take care of her. To them this is all money."
My army mate walked in on his maid + her bf lying on his bed when he went home from work early one day. This why some employers don't allow maids to have relationships.
what happened next? HAHA
He told them to get the fk out of his house. His parents cancelled her work permit and sent her home a few days later.
did he ask her to change the bed sheets before?
Hahaha I feel like the poster above was subtly hinting at a more... sultry outcome
"I think OP is more against the concept of having maids itself than the actual rules and practices about being a maid in Singapore.Truth is, being a maid is already a subjugating and demeaning role. You do have to give up a lot of your rights. That’s just fact. We can debate about what’s the least harmful way and most humane, but OP won’t be satisfied. You think we don’t know it sucks? If the maid lives somewhere else and we aren’t liable for their welfare, then ofc go and live your life, we also don’t want to play the role of the disciplinarian. But they have access to our homes and children, and there’s money to be lost. A lot of people who have maids are just ordinary working people, not particularly rich. I’m sorry it sucks but that takes priority over the maid’s dating life. Otherwise the alternative would lead to a decrease in taking maids and thereby less jobs for their people.Maybe your real problem is that there is no employer organisation or their home country organisation that can actually take care of them and negotiate on their behalf while taking on the financial responsibility and accountability of their welfare while they are here."
"I think it depends on employer some are more lax. Most important the rules of what is confortable to both parties must be laid out from the start. I have a maid and also a newborn baby. My maid's duty is to keep the house spick and span basically housekeeping duties on a daily basis. I take care of my child myself and when I return to work, will send her to infant care.My philosophy is that both parties should not cause stress to each other. If any party violates that rule, we can terminate the contract. It works both ways.For me this is definitely one, I will fire her. For one I am already quite uncomfortable having a total stranger in my house. House is my safe haven I don't want to ponder whether she will bring back another complete stranger who might copy my keys and have access anytime to my house. Its also highly inappropriate if she introduces her bf to my child. Who knows what might happened. I mean this can be prevented from the start by hiring someone who is married which is what I did.Also if her relationship has problems, I don't want to be the one to be involved. You will be surprised how emotions can affect work quality. Also the fear she might get pregnant and I am responsible for it.Honestly Singapore should perhaps implement a system whereby maids go to employers house during working hours like say 8am-6pm and go back to their own living quarters after. I will be very happy to have a maid like this."
"Agree with your comment here. OP's post is highly subjective and only provides a one-sided narrative from the viewpoint of the helper.Nevertheless, it is appalling to read some of the other comments on this tread which borders on controlling, compulsive behaviors and discrimination."
"That is pretty fucked up. I tell my maid to use a condom when she sees her man. Not my business unless you get pregnant and then we have an issue. Her SO gives my kid a biscuit I dont give a. shit. They can use the pool at my condo, the skyjack, whatever on her day off. He can be her guest as she lives here and has access to the amenities."
The condo management allows? Or they close an eye as long as no one complains?
"woah, what. you treat your employee like she's an actual human being??? /sI'm guessing you're not Singaporean."
You would guess correctly.
I think it is pretty fucked up that you will allow your child to consume food given by strangers when you are not around. Even parents of teens will not allow that and will have warned their children to be wary of consuming food offered by strangers.
"What you have to understand is that Singapore has strict laws to curb low-skilled immigrants. So FDWs (and construction workers) are contract workers; they can only come here if they have a contract lined up. If their work permit expires (FDWs is a 2 year contract) and they haven’t renewed their contract or found another employer, they have to leave Singapore. They cannot stay and have a family in Singapore. If an FDW is pregnant, they cannot work and have to leave; they have to go for medical checkups every 6 months to make sure they aren’t pregnant.Employers are against their FDWs having boyfriends because they know that the relationship cannot end in marriage and it’s just infidelity or premarital sex, leading to drama and security issues. Even if a local man marries her (by going to her home country; can’t be done here), she will be barred from living here. Usually though, the boyfriend is another work permit holder like a construction worker from a different country, and it’s impossible for them to live happily ever after. Employers would like their FDWs to keep focused on their work, earn enough money to either support their kids back home or go home to get married and set up a small business or something."
It's not the case. My mom's friend married his best mate's maid and is currently living in Singapore.
"I will correct myself and say that the FDW or former FDW must seek permission from MOM to marry a Singapore citizen or PR. It’s case-by-case basis and not easily granted. Apparently there’s a higher chance if the FDW goes back to her home country for at least 2 years before being married. Some anecdotes here: https://www.kiasuparents.com/kiasu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=27290Of course, it’s also possible that the FDW managed to change her identity and married under a different name and passport."
The domestic helper has been in Singapore for 16 years under the same employer and she had to quit to marry the dude. So i guess it happens.
"There's a ton of baggage that comes along for the ride when your helper gets a boyfriend. She can feel unjustified, but the employer is already being very kind by just sending her back."

"As someone who engages a helper to take care of a child, I fully support the parents in this case. The employers are given unfair responsibility on their helper's behaviour by the authorities and thus such measures are taken by employers.Employers may keep the passports of the helpers as MOM punishes the employers if the maid goes missing. Employers are also punished if the maid can no longer work because she gets pregnant.Due to the access to privacy bestowed to the helper from having to provide a place to stay, it is natural to want to know who the helper is mixing with. You do not want your place cleared out when you are at work or worse, family members harmed because of the maid colluding with someone you wouldn't normally trust.It may seem inhumane, but it has to be viewed that the employer-domestic helper relationship is very much different from the normal employer-employee relationship due to the amount of access the domestic helper has to carry out the tasks. Government policies further add unnecessary burden on employers who have little means to carry out those expectations without having higher cost or inconvenience."
"FYI It is illegal for an employer to keep their helper's passport. https://www.mom.gov.sg/faq/work-pass-general/can-an-employer-keep-a-workers-passportFurther, you cannot justify inhumane behaviour on the basis that it is not a typical employer-employer relationship or that government policies mitigate/encourage/justify inhumane behaviour. Treating a human being in an inhumane way is unacceptable under any circumstance. This is precisely why the government mandates all new FDW employers enroll in training prior to employing a helper. Having been through this training it can be neatly summarised as: ""These people are humans too, treat them as you would wish to be treated"".The mindset that helpers are in someway 'different' is what results in the multiple cases of maid abuse that are seen in this country"
"Not legal don't mean it is inhumane. I am against mistreatment of fdw as well.Keeping the passports don't mean the fdw can't move freely around, just not out of the country. If the fdw needs to leave the country, the employer should naturally be informed. Is ICA willing to check with the fdw employers each time a fdw is leaving the country before they can be allowed to leave? The government does not provide enough support to both fdw and fdw employers and the employers are just protecting themselves the way they can, especially from unfair punishment by the government. Why should employers bear even half of the deposit when fdw flee the country?Where are the protection to employers when fdw abuse the trust given to them? If family members are hurt by the fdw, the punishment by the courts, if any, has no meaning to the employers."
"How would you feel if your employer held your passport? I think it implies a degree of power and control that is certainly degrading if not inhumane.The bond/deposit/insurance etc is the price you pay in return for being able to pay a low wage to the fdw, also while ensuring the fdw is not left high and dry should things not work out. Combined they are a lot less than if you were to engage these services from locals (cleaning, childcare etc).Ultimately it is about trust. I find it staggering that employers are prepared to trust their fdw with their house and children but yet don't trust them enough to not abscond overseas at any moment. Sure, there are some bad apples like their are in all walks of life, but I don't see why fdw's should be treated any differently from anyone else."
"It’s a simple breach of work ethics. No personal engagement should be done during working hours. We all go to work everyday and our partners don’t hang around in our workplaces, do they? The maid can spend as much time as she desires with her boyfriend during the time-off from work. But when she’s working, she’s supposed to be working."
"One thing i don't understand is why employers keep the passport of their maids? MOM explicitly state that employers should not keep their maids' passports and yet, many people do. It feels like the maid is being made a prisoner no?"
Many cases of helpers stealing all the employer’s cash/valuable items then disappearing back home. Even if you make a police report there’s no use because SPF is not going to chase them back to their hometowns.
So that they do not just flee anytime. There have been such cases of maids fleeing back to their country or elsewhere. End up the employers have to pay additional costs and also spend more $$$ to find a new maid.
"The Govt has made it clear FDWs are not to have bfs or get married here and they make employers sign insurance and bonds in the event the FDWs get pregnant or get into an incident with the bfs, etc, employers are fined or not able to claim their insurance. Correct me if I am wrong on this. But it could be why the employer decided to terminate the contract. Besides the fact that the bf (a total stranger) was feeding the child without permission from the parents."
"Maid pregnant = employer fined. If this is part of the govt regulations, it should be changed. Why should employers be responsible for the maid's personal relationships and actions outside of work.This is what's driving passport-keeping behaviour and employers to have an unhealthy control over the personal lives of maids."
I think there is definitely a good reason for such regulation which an individual like you and me may not be able to understand because we are not planning a system for a country of ppl. We are just layman commentators.Meanwhile I think it’s best to avoid shaming any groups of ppl if we don’t know the full story.
"The employer has a legal obligation to ensure that the maid in their employ does not get pregnant, or otherwise run afoul of the law.Under the MOM regulations those who are on work permits should not become pregnant or give birth until they are married to the Singapore citizen or a permanent resident under the permission of the Government. Those maids that get pregnant while on duty have breached the terms of employment.Source: http://singaporemaidagency.com/What-Happens-If-My-Singapore-Maid-Gets-Pregnant-While-Under-My-Employment.phpHowever, what employers may not know is that their security deposit will not be forfeited in the event it happens. So they tend to err on the side of caution.MOM understands employers' concerns that they should not be held responsible when their FDWs violate the Work Permit conditions on their own accord, especially outside designated work hours or on their rest days. Therefore, since January 2010, MOM has removed employers’ liability if the FDW gets pregnant or breaches other Work Permit conditions that relate to her own behaviour. It is untrue that the $5,000 security bond will be forfeited for pregnancy.Source: https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-replies/2011/5000-security-bond-not-forfeited-if-maids-get-pr"
One of the key element the maid agreed before coming to SG - They are not allowed to be pregnant. Getting themselves into a r/s is like border line flirting with the regulation.
There is a VERY big gap between being in a realtionship and being pregant.Are Singaporeans even this worried about their children in relationships getting pregant as they are about their maids?
Shit happens.Who to pay the abortion costs? Who to pay the confiscated bond fee?You?Do you really naively think the foreign guys who fxxx the maids will be responsible for the kid and pay for pregnancy fees? They probably book a ticket and fly home.
"Who to pay the abortion costs?Just deport her. Whether she wants to abort or not is her own business.Who to pay the confiscated bond fee?Ignorance. The bond will not be confiscated if a maid gets pregnant. The rule has been changed for almost a decade already.Do you really naively think the foreign guys who fxxx the maids will be responsible for the kid and pay for pregnancy fees?You can advise, but ultimately, it's up to the maid how she wants to live her life."
"https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-domestic-worker/eligibility-and-requirements/security-bondYou or your helper violate any of the conditions of the Work Permit or security bond.If the helper goes missing, half of the security bond ($2,500) will be forfeited if you have made reasonable effort to locate her and have filed a police report.You will not be liable for your helper’s violations (such as those relating to pregnancy) if you can prove that you have:Informed her of the Work Permit conditions she must comply with. Reported a violation when you first become aware of it.Note, if you can prove. If you can't prove your bond is gone again. It was Last Updated: 21 June 2018, so your statement with confidence was an assumption without any research.Also note, if your maid is pregnant and doctor advice she cannot travel then as employer you have to bare her entire medical procedure cost (most likely insurance will not cover all medical procedure). As helper don't considered Singaporean/PR, she will not get any subsidy and all cost be considered private. Not many of us have thousand of dollars as spare cash in our accounts while paying bills, looking after our old parents medical bills and kids."
"Note, if you can prove. If you can't prove your bond is gone again. It was Last Updated: 21 June 2018, so your statement with confidence was an assumption without any research.Inform her in front of the agent and get her to sign it.Any maid can run away. In fact, it's harder for a pregnant maid to be on the run.Also note, if your maid is pregnant and doctor advice she cannot travel then as employer you have to bare her entire medical procedure cost (most likely insurance will not cover all medical procedure).They have to be very late in the pregnancy or have a very special case to be barred from travelling.As helper don't considered Singaporean/PR, she will not get any subsidy and all cost be considered private. Not many of us have thousand of dollars as spare cash in our accounts while paying bills, looking after our old parents medical bills and kids.If your family is really poor, there is financial assistance for such cases."
"When next time i will sign a contract with my helper agency i will remind them to make a new clause and contract for me to add all this. As i am on it, i will let MOM knows that they should put this as norm practice to make agency download latest document and made sure helper read and understand all those before sign on them (But again they will tell me agency already know all this and should inform helpers before they bring them to Singapore).To be fair with Employer, if i had a serious medical condition which is not fully covered by their insurance which they sign for me they are not going to fork money out of their pocket for my medical procedure. Even last time my company had specific limit for GP fee (around 80$), if fee go above the limit Employee have to pay from their pocket (I had to pay from my pocket a number of times due to my medical condition). So should i tell Company if they are poor then financial assistance is available for them?BTW just to add, my reply was to your comment that it was change decade ago. Which was blatant lie as you never did any research."
"So should i tell Company if they are poor then financial assistance is available for them?I do not know there's such financial assistance for companies. But our government is nice enough to provide financial assistance for employers of FDWs.BTW just to add, my reply was to your comment that it was change decade ago. Which was blatant lie as you never did any research.I did not say you will not be fined if your maid run away. I said you will not be fined if your maid gets pregnant. A few people already provided the link in this thread."
"I do not know there's such financial assistance for companies. But our government is nice enough to provide financial assistance for employers of FDWs.I am well aware about Lavy Grant, but i don't know or not aware if they will ever have anything which assist in medical expenses.As i mentioned in my comments above, MOM need to do more to safe guard disadvantage parties. Just make it is compulsory that helper stay at their own, when they are off from work Employer will not bother if they are meeting their b/f. I am sure if MOM remove all penalties/liabilities then no one will make much noise. In my previous job a higher up staff was asked to break off with her immediate boss, because they said it was against ethics or else lose job (so yes company can ask if you can have b/f or not)."
"I am well aware about Lavy Grant, but i don't know or not aware if they will ever have anything which assist in medical expenses.Lavy grant? You mean levy? It's different. It's a separate scheme for employers who have problem paying for their domestic worker's medical expenses.As i mentioned in my comments above, MOM need to do more to safe guard disadvantage parties. Just make it is compulsory that helper stay at their own, when they are off from workIt will drive up cost for employers. But I support this. It will also reduce abuse cases.In my previous job a higher up staff was asked to break off with her immediate boss, because they said it was against ethics or else lose job (so yes company can ask if you can have b/f or not).Dating your immediate supervisor is a conflict of interest. That's not comparable.You see some other arguments in this thread. Relationships can affect job performance etc. Our relationships can do the same. So should our employers bar us from dating too?"
Y'all right I'm ignorant. Ain't no time for this
"Shit happens.A metorite could strike your domestic worker. Are you gonna prevent her from walking outside?You can tell her to not get pregnant, but forcing her to not have a boyfreind is borderline slave treatment.You don't own your worker."
"Are you some kind of retarded fuckwit? How do you draw parallels between the probability of a meteorite striking your maid and the probability your maid with a boyfriend gets pregnant? Should I then say a random person could very well stab you the moment you step outside your house, are you never going to leave your house? Or perhaps you could contract food poisoning and die from eating, are you going to never eat?"
"Haha I must say sir, I'm enjoying your strongly worded retorts quite a lot"
"No, but you own the contract that allows her to work in Singapore. If she does something that breaks the trust between employer and helper, he is at complete liberty to dismiss her."
"No offence, have you ever had a maid before? Your comments seem extremely naive. I mean, if your maid has a boyfriend in Singapore, you are telling me you trust her completely? That she won’t bring her boyfriend to your own house? And can you be 100% sure that they won’t have sexual intercourse? Not saying that they shouldn’t have a boyfriend, but they come to Singapore to work, IN the employer’s house, as maids."
"Bro try own a maid and have one running away and getting pregnant.Let me see if you are still jeen being a SJW. Hell, how about liberate 50% of the population by abolishing NS?"
"OP not Singaporean la, clearly doesn’t know anything about how the system works in SG lmao. Also when we say owning Maids, we do not literally say we OWN them, it’s just an easier way to say that the maid is employed under us."
"OP is a youngster.Paying relatively little taxes, free-riding the resources and security this state is giving him/her. He or she is also looking to move abroad to study University for free.I wonder if he/she will come back to this little nation that provided the stepping board or complain about how this nation's citizens are non-liberal and bunch of elitists. But he or she, being ignorant, have completely no idea how the state and it's people function or live."

"Are Singaporeans even this worried about their children in relationships getting pregant as they are about their maids?Singaporean here. A female Singaporean friend of mine - turning 27 this year - gets yelled at by her parents all the time about being sexually active. Her father called her a whore, a prostitute, and because she slept with a foreigner, he said she was selling herself to foreigners (note: the sex was consensual and she didn't get 'paid' for it obvs). Perhaps I have had a different upbringing on such things, but I was appalled her father would use such words, even commoditising her vagina. Her mother breathes down her neck about being pregnant, asking if the man would even marry her if she has a baby, asking when they'll get married etc (they're not bf/gf). Given that a lot of people in Singapore see their kids as some kind of investment expecting to get ROI, to answer your question: yes."
"So if you're not planning to get pregnant you can't have a relationship ah? This is not the Sims 1 man, you can't get pregnant by holding hands or going on a date."
"They come to Singapore to work, not to be in relationships. And the fact that they have a boyfriend means that there is a chance they may have sexual intercourse and get pregnant. And before you say having boyfriend does not equal to being pregnant, there have been quite a few cases where the maid is pregnant or even brought home their boyfriend to the employer’s house. And when the maid gets pregnant, the employer is the one suffers and pay $$$. Even if the maid doesn’t get pregnant, can you imagine if she brings her boyfriend to your house, without you ever knowing? Such instances has happened before, which is why Singaporean employers are much more cautious. Unless you tell me that the agency or Sgpore govt will bear the full costs of whatever that happens to the maid, otherwise, it’s not fair to the employers."
How about their Work Permit doesn't allow them to get pregnant or married sooooo
"The employer-maid system here should be regulated by a basic contract applicable for all sg maids, in terms of stipulated hours of work not more than a certain number, and rights that maids have. Perhaps a union of maids and maid agencies to fight for their terms. Any other extra employer rules out of the contract can be discussed separately. Free market in this case is to the disadvantage of the maids.Edit: the govt is not doing enough as a neutral party and should step in to enforce proper rights and rules."
"Seeing some of the comments here, it's better if Singapore stops taking in foreign maids.They are just being exploited by cheapo Singaporeans.Need help for your parents? Care workers existNeed help for cleaning? Cleaning agencies existNeed help for your kids? Childcare centers and nannies exist.Getting a maid just seems like an excuse to throw all these things on them without accountability."
‘It’s better if Singapore stops taking in foreign maids’You make it sound so easy uh. How about everyone just fire their maids now eh? Problem solved. /s
"Yeah send all the maids back now. Then let’s match the needs of different households to all the recommended avenues. Sure can. And if you cannot afford, better don’t have babies. Your elderly parents better stay fit and healthy."
"Yup. There are alternatives that exist. Just that you don't want to hear about them because it's too expensive.Try to find someone who will do all 3 for the pittance of the salary you are giving while taking away your basic rights.Stop confusing needs of household with wants. You can get a trained nanny but because she cost as much as a maid while being entitled to offs, vacation time and being able to go home, you don't want to do that.FYI, my mum had breast cancer, my stepdad is in his 60s and they die die don't want a maid. I would rather get a trained care worker to care for my parents and pay extra for trained care than trusting them to a young maid.If you want a maid, better treat them properly, not like a slave just because you pay a pittance of a salary. My argument is in favor of treating maids better and until Singaporeans can do that, I don't think you deserve a maid."
"Jesus Christ, OP is fking ignorant, and also, he/she isn’t a Singaporean, which explains his/her ignorance. First off, the reason the maid’s passport is kept by the employer is such that they do not just leave whenever they want to. Just to let you know, there are already TONS of cases where the maid has fled the country not because they are mistreated, but because they just didn’t feel like staying anymore. And when they do that, the employers are the one who suffer, and pay a lot more $$$ as well as the cost of having to find a NEW maid. Secondly, maids should not have a boyfriend because they can just easily bring their boyfriend to the employer’s house, and who knows what they do. There have been a many cases of such instances, which is why employers are very fearful, because ultimately, it is the employers who suffer the MOST losses from such happenings. All in all, the reason for Singaporean employers to do such things is because these cases has happened many many many many times before, and trust me, the cost to clean up all this shit isn’t worth paying for."
"Jesus Christ, OP is fking ignorant, and also, he/she isn’t a Singaporean, which explains his/her ignorance. First off, the reason the maid’s passport is kept by the employer is such that they do not just leave whenever they want to.You know that is illegal right?"
I think that is a subset of the mentality that explains why there are some cases of maids being treated like abused animals here. Sad. And from this thread it seems there are many trying to normalize some archaic views
"It's a result of the govt regulation that employers are fined when maids get pregnant. Say, a work pass staff at Gong Cha, if they get pregnant, does Gong Cha get fined? No? Then no reason for maid employers to get fined."
"If following govt regulation is so important, withholding passports is illegal here. As it is in most civilized places."
"And here he is calling people ""fking ignorant""."
"As a society, we have generally agreed that it is not acceptable to force someone to work for you against their will, even if you will suffer negative financial consequences when they leave. That is why slavery is outlawed, and why breach of employment contracts cannot be remedied by specific performance (i.e., the court will never issue a court order forcing a person to continue to work for you, no matter what your employment contract says).Any employee in Singapore can choose to stop working for you and flee to another country before compensating you for the costs to your business, for example, in having to find a last minute replacement. Yet we don’t allow employers to keep our ICs. We don’t allow employers to lock us out of our apartmenrs and never go home to find our families. Why should maids be subject to the kind of abuses that we would never allow ourselves and our own family members to be subject to?"
"That worker also don't have access to your house, where you keep your secret stash of money or valuables. Are you gonna compensate the owner when the maid sweeps up all the valuables and skip town while you are at work? You sjw should go out and see the real world.Of course we would love to treat others with dignity and respect, but sometimes olds ways to deal with problems are the best. It's not like we are not gonna return their passports like those barbarians in the gulf states if they need it for travel."
"So you agree that preventing someone from returning home when they really need to is barbaric. But what stops our maid employers doing exactly that? If you think that forcing maids to stay in Singapore to take care of a Singaporean baby while, for example, their own children are sick and dying and they really need to go home, is barbaric, what’s there to prevent these barbaric acts if withholding passports becomes a social norm?In fact, I bet your ass that these “barbaric” acts are already happening in Singapore. Maids have virtually zero bargaining power in that situation; you think there are no Singaporeans that would prioritize the welfare of their own children over whatever problems the maid has at home? There’s a reason that such actions have been made illegal; it’s because the law recognizes that people cannot always be trusted to act morally, and that when put in situations of extreme power imbalance, a non-trivial subset of the population will almost certainly abuse that power. Why do you think slavery is outlawed when historically, there are some slaveowners that treated their slaves well and even married them? It’s because slavery creates a system that enabled and facilitated cruelty and abuse even when it does not occur in every slaveowner’s household. The very same argument applies to other employment environments in which one party has absolutely no bargaining power and no means of leaving that work environment.Also the argument about having access to your valuables doesn’t really make sense, when bank employees, accountants and conveyancing lawyers could even more easily steal all of your or your company’s hard earned money before running off to another country, and yet we don’t withhold their passports when employing them."
"They are barbaric not because they keep their passports, but because of the way foreign workers are treated in the gulf states. Just google about how Indian and Bangladeshi workers building the football stadiums for World Cup 2020 in Qatar are treated.Parents of course wants the best for their children. Would you as a parent, want to keep an unwilling maid in your house? Or would you just go to the agency and change a maid? It's not like the majority of us are sadists and wanna keep an unwilling woman around in the house sulking and doing what not. I don't wanna eat nasi kang kang tyvm.You don't handle a lot of money don't you? That's what the SOPs and compliance departments are for? Risk management heard of it?I understand keeping the passports of anyone is illegal. It should never happen but it does, why? Because there is no recourse when shit happens to the house owners. We are not a company, where company loses do not belong to the individual. The company can go bankrupt and the worst you can be is to be out of a job. Loses in our own homes can never be recovered, because do you expect to sue her in Indonesia? Myanmar? Philippines?In the construction, shipping and industrial sectors, a lot of foreign workers are abused, and passports withheld because of unscrupulous employers. That's why we need MoM, TWC2, and many NGOs to step in to help. The domestic helper sector, however, is different. The helpers do not work in a public space, they work in the most private of places, our very homes. We don't want to engineer our homes to be like an office, where I need to scan in and write down the daily tasks on log book and have my wife sign off. The compromise would be to safekeep the passport, and to return it to her whenever she needs.Maybe you can enlighten us, what would be a good alternative method instead?"
"I think it’s really a stretch to say that maid employers simply have no choice but to illegally confiscate their maids’ passports.Lots of people (probably the majority of employers) get by without taking away their maids’ passports. We all live with some degree of risk in our daily lives; we don’t ban cars just because lots of pedestrians die from car accidents everyday.There are also other precautions you can take in your own home, such as locking valuables up in a safe or installing CCTV cameras at key areas.At the end of the day, no one is forcing us to hire maids. The vast vast majority of first world countries around the world don’t rely on foreign domestic helpers to sustain their dual income middle class household model. Even in Singapore, many people either get by without, or use weekly cleaning services. Yes, there are many lower / lower middle class households that benefit tremendously from the low cost labour provided by helpers, but we shouldn’t take it as a god given right to just do whatever we want to have access to such labour.You already recognize that withholding passports either constitutes or can contribute to abuse in other industries. I really don’t think it’s asking a lot from employers to not withhold passports and rely on other ways to mitigate whatever risks they think they face from hiring a live in domestic helper."
"At the end of the day, no one is forcing us to hire maids.Agreed.You can't justify the lack of basic humanity, racism and exploitation simply because of your needs.""Maids"" or domestic helpers as I prefer to call them, are humans too. They will act like humans meaning they come with their own mentality / habits and are good and bad. You should know this before making the decision to hire a maid.If you cannot understand this and decide that you want to control another human being. Then I would suggest please do not hire a domestic helper. Deal with your shit yourself."
"Yes of course non-Singaporean means ignorant.I work with TWC2 an organization that aids in the legal rights of foreign workers and maids in the country. Although I'm just a translator, I've been here long enough to know the rules of a foreign worked contractMaids passport is NOT kept by employers that is illegal as per MOM rules. I'm so ignorant to you but at least I know that.Also guess what? There are TONS of cases of maids being mistreated and either killing themselves or leaving because of mistreatment. I work with these cases everyday.So please check your own ignorance before accusing others of it."
"Exactly, look at OP’s comment history. I called him out on another sub-reddit many times because he keeps shitting on Singapore to foreigners with misinformation. BTW he has alt accounts that he uses to manipulate votes."
"GUYS, just to let you know, OP is a Bangladeshi. LMAO. Which is probably why he is pissed when you guys say the maids might get pregnant with some Bangladeshi construction worker. No wonder so defensive for the maids.To avoid any misunderstanding, what are you implying?"
"In your pathetic attempt to shoehorn your latent racism, you don’t seem to process that OP may have a professional capacity to make his statements https://reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/asn59x/why_do_maid_employers_have_this_much_control_over/egvvf57"
"And he had a lot of upvotes just now.Not sure if he's implying OP is a construction worker with a maid gf. OP's history showed that he's LGBT. There's also an ama that he's studying here and he's family is here. From OP's English, it's believable that he's at least quite educated."
"I volunteer at TWC2 an organization that aids foreign workers with their legal rights here in Singapore. It is my job to know the SG system for maids and how they're treated. My organization wouldn't exist if maids were being treated fairly by employers.Yes , I'm Bangladeshi. I translate for the organization to foreign workers. What does that have to do with anything? What exactly are you implying?You really don't see us as humans, huh."
Aiyo what an asshole that dude was. Sorry bout that on his/her behalf.
No wonder there are these stories popping up like this every month.edit: lol downvoted w/ no comments for showing that maids kill themselves in Singapore. You can't treat people like slaves and also expect they will perfectly happy in your country.
I'm surprised that majority disagree with you
"Not surprised. If you look through at some of the comments OP has made and the counter arguments of others, you should know why lol."
I think employers are wary as some bad apples spoil the market; https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-employers-getting-private-eyes-to-trail-maids
"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-employers-getting-private-eyes-to-trail-maidsThis is horrific.Wow, the more I read about this stuff it seems like maids in Singapore live in an actual 1984."
"My family is pretty lax with the helpers, but we too have had our share of bad experiences. For example stealing my sisters clothes, bringing strangers into the house when we're out, taking photos of herself in my sister under garments and the weirdest one was hiding a frozen chicken under her pillow."
stealing my sisters clothesHow did the maid think she could get away with that? And she couldn't wear them anyway.taking photos of herself in my sister under garmentsWTF? Your sis's under garments are very cute / sexy or just normal one?the weirdest one was hiding a frozen chicken under her pillow.Did you ask her why?
weirdest one was hiding a frozen chicken under her pillow.hAhahahahaha wow i need some more context behind this. I can't think of any reason for this
maybe some weird ritual? I heard of nasi kang kang before so maybe ayam kang kang?/s
Do let us know more about the frozen chicken under the pillow story.
"Her previous employer didn’t feed her much, always instant noodles and left overs, so she was worried we will starve her too. Which is nonsense tbh, all our maids go home heavier than they arrive 😂😂😂"
Man that is fked up how they dont even let their maid eat a full meal.
"Because they can. Singapore employers are notorious for treating helpers badly enough that, were they dogs instead, they'd have a visit from the SPCA followed by arrest and fines. People excuse themselves by saying, ""Well, over in [this differently-ethnic country], I hear it's much worse! So there!""Empathy and humanity have become literally foreign concepts in the short time I've been here (~40 years).Majulah?"
"Why have livein maids anyway? Theres cleaning services, child care center and formal nanny type people to do the job. Why don't ppl use those and have more privacy?"
All those services added together are going to cost a lot more than a live in helper
"Our approach to our maidWe rented a larger flat so she could have a bedroom - we live in a newish condo and the bunker room is not fit for human living (no window, no air, no AC),She leaves Saturday at 5pm and returns Sunday at 9pm - stays with her boyfriendWe pay for her to fly home twice a year (economy) during holidaysShe has wifi access/facilities access - she can go to the gym or pool in the evenings as long as one of us is aroundAND HOW DOES SHE REPAY US?She works really hardShe is amazing with our kidsShe has never let us downShe wants to extend her contractI wonder which employer you are most likely to steal from/cause an issue for? One that degrades you and dehumanizes you or one who values your civil liberties and treats you like a human."
"We did the same for our maid too, but she stole a lot of my clothing and just talks to her boyfriend on her phone all day instead of working. Just goes to show that it really depends on the character of the maid too."
"...with an unhealthy dose of ""I'm screamed at all day by people who can get away with it, so I'm going to come home and treat a human being like a piece of my ex-gf's furniture"". Empathy is lost on the self-righteous. I hear a shit ton of anecdotes here, but HOME et al have actual studies with real verifiable data that isn't anecdotal. We have a shitty human-rights record; we're the SE Asia centre of human trafficking; we've got the fastest-growing inequality in SE Asia. 40 years ago, we really were trying to do better."
Didn't even notice haw flakes gotbrand one. Its my favourite snack somemore
"Train Brand Haw Flakes recalled after woman says she bit into glassA brand of haw flakes snack has been voluntarily recalled by its supplier in Singapore after a consumer claimed that she had bitten into a piece of glass while eating it.Mr Albert Goh, Sinhua Hock Kee Trading's business development and marketing executive, told The Straits Times that it asked supermarket chains to recall Train Brand Haw Flakes on Tuesday after receiving the complaint.When contacted, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) said it has received feedback on this and is investigating.The affected batch comes in a nine-piece pack and has an expiry date of Dec 31, 2020. The recall will be completed by tomorrow.Mr Gohsaid the snack is manufactured in China and the firm has not yet received the affected product. ""We take food safety seriously. We are curious about how there was glass in the product, as all the equipment used at the factory is made of stainless steel,"" he said.He added that the woman, who gave her name as Ms Koh, e-mailed the firm and complained of a sore throat. She said that she bought the product at a Sheng Siong supermarket branch. The firm has offered to foot the bill for any medical check-up she might undergo, said Mr Goh.A Sheng Siong spokesman said the supplier had brought the issue to its attention and the supermarket had taken the product off its shelves. Customers who bought the product from the batch with the specified expiry date can seek a refund at its stores, she said, adding that the affected customer, Ms Koh, can call the supermarket on 6895-1888 for help.Related Story Lettuce recalled over high levels of pesticideRelated Story AVA recalls frozen raw pork from the Netherlands after Salmonella outbreakRelated Story Canadian brand of baby food recalledRelated Story Muji recalls pasta sauce after small plastic pieces found in some productsSeparately, AVA said GoPurpose was fined $1,600 yesterday for selling food products labelled with fraudulent expiry dates.AVA received feedback in June last year that GoPurpose might have sold Chaga Health pre-packed food products beyond their recommended expiry dates.Investigations revealed that the firm had replaced the original expiry dates on the products with new dates that went beyond the manufacturer's recommended date.Under the Sale of Food Act (Food Regulations), those found guilty can be fined up to $1,000 for a first conviction, and up to $2,000 for subsequent convictions.In its statement yesterday, AVA said all pre-packed food products for sale in Singapore must be labelled according to the general labelling requirements of the Singapore Food Regulations.It added that accurate date-marking of expiry dates for products is important as products past their expiry dates might have deteriorated in quality.

"Can you roughly describe how she was lost?I think I saw same breed (but 2 dogs) around Avenue 4 yesterday ard 5pm+, but has an owner, missed out on the collar type/pattern."
She snuck out of the house. We were told by neighbours (who knows mimi very well) that they saw here loitering at a staircase leading her down to nearby hdb flats.We have sources that mimi was taken away and possibly still within ang mo kio.There is no collar on probably but she used to be wearing a purple collar
I live at amk. I'll help keep a lookout. Just sent to my family group as well. Mimi is adorable :D hope she's found soon!
Thank you so much!! I hope so too!
"If we care about rising inequality at all, we should be taxing wealth — and therefore capital income — more.Lee Hsien Loong laughing face."
"The curious case of missing wealth taxes in SingaporeIt should come as no surprise to anyone that the Budget Statement of 2019 did not introduce any new taxes on wealth in Singapore nor raise the rates of the few existing wealth taxes.We should also not be surprised if no Member of Parliament suggests raising taxes on wealth in the budget debate to follow. This is an indication of how dominant or hegemonic Singapore's pro-capital stance is — that even in a Budget that is presented as a socially progressive one, no one is likely to question the low taxes on wealth.The missing debate on wealth taxes is not just curious, it is also unhealthy.As Singapore ages and if economic growth slows, wealth inequality will become more pronounced even as the demands on social spending rise. It is therefore important to consider whether and how wealth in Singapore should be taxed.WHY TAXING WEALTH MAKE ECONOMIC SENSEAs the Paris School of Economics’ Thomas Piketty has explained, differences in wealth is a greater source of inequality than differences in labour income.Wealth comes from the ownership of capital, i.e. financial and physical assets. As ownership of capita is far more unequally distributed than labour, the former is a bigger determinant of inequality.In Capital in the 21st Century, Professor Piketty also observed that except in times of war and depression, the annual rate of return on capital has averaged nearly 5 per cent.In mature economies, labour incomes are increasing at a much slower rate mainly because growth in these economies is well below 5 per cent.Inequality, Professor Piketty posits, rises when the rate of return on capital exceeds the growth rate of the economy.Singapore is now growing at below 5 per cent, even as we expect the return on capital to be close to its historical average of 4-5 per cent. If we care about rising inequality at all, we should be taxing wealth — and therefore capital income — more.Second, the ratio of capital income — that is, capital gains, dividends, interest and rental income — to labour income increases exponentially as one gets closer to the super-rich (e.g. the top 1 per cent) in the income distribution.In Singapore, capital is taxed very lightly: there is no capital gains tax or inheritance tax; dividend and interest income are also exempt from personal income tax. Property taxes are relatively low, and only rental income is taxed at one's marginal tax rate.Given that the rich derive a significantly larger share of their income from capital, the very low taxes on capital in Singapore means that capital owners may be paying a lower effective tax rate than the (upper) middle class whose main (if not only) source of income is their labour.Admittedly, income taxes in Singapore are not high either and most wage-earners in Singapore pay very little income taxes. Most of them also own some capital in the form of their public flats.But the fact remains that capital income in Singapore is mostly not taxed, whereas labour income and consumption are. This make the overall tax system less equitable than it should be.The third argument for wealth taxes is the fact that in an economy that would be constantly disrupted by new technologies, we should expect inequality to increase.This is because automation, artificial intelligence and other digital technologies are likely to disrupt labour-intensive activities more so than capital- or knowledge-intensive ones.The productivity gains from these disruptions will also accrue more to capital owners than to labourers, even if these disruptions create more jobs than they destroy.This is also why we hear arguments, by technologists such as Bill Gates, for governments to impose a tax on robots, a form of capital.TAXING CAPITAL SENSIBLYThe good news for Singapore is that taxes on wealth or capital income can be quite easily introduced without creating perverse incentives.Singapore could start with a low tax (say 5-10 per cent) on capital gains, as well as treat dividend and interest income as taxable once again.Dividends and interest income were exempt from tax in the early 2000s as part of the government’s effort to lower income taxes to attract talent and capital to the country.This was during the era of hyper-globalisation, when it was widely believed that governments had to reduce income and capital taxes and shrink social safety nets to compete for talent and investments.After the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, much of this neoliberal ideology has been discredited.Globalisation is also slowing; a recent issue of the Economist magazine was headlined “Slowbalisation” and showed how across several metrics the cross-border flows of goods, services and money are growing more slowly (or not at all).In such a world, our stance of not taxing capital income would probably not make much difference in drawing foreign capital to our shores.Meanwhile, the state is giving up a potentially valuable source of revenue, which may necessitate higher taxes elsewhere to finance higher social expenditures.At low levels, taxes on capital income will not reduce savings and investment. And because ownership of capital is much more unevenly distributed than labour income, such taxes increase the overall progressiveness of the tax system.In short, low and simple wealth taxes are efficient and equitable.There is also a case for taxing inheritances. The estate duty was abolished in 2008 to make Singapore a more attractive place for building up wealth.Although unpopular, taxes on inheritances are the least distorting. Unlike income taxes, they do not reduce incentives to work. And unlike taxes on consumption (such as Goods and Services Tax), they are progressive.Even opponents of taxation in general should support taxing inheritances if revenues have to be raised somehow.Nonetheless, the former estate duty did not raise much revenue. Its high exemption level meant that almost all estates were exempt from it.The solution would be to treat inheritances above a certain threshold as taxable income — and to tax them at our marginal tax rates. Since Singapore’s personal income tax regime is already low and progressive, taxing inheritances this way would deliver similar benefits.Taxing wealth should be popular since most of us aren’t wealthy enough to pay these taxes. But because of naive optimism, many of us may believe that we would eventually be wealthy.This “false consciousness” may result in the middle class aligning themselves with the rich who, understandably, are against such taxes.And if the middle class are opposed to wealth taxes — even though it is in their interests — we would also expect wealth to continue being taxed very lightly in Singapore, to the detriment of society.

Published in Today. Who would've thought?!
Why are you surprised?
"Budget 2019 is about cementing regressive taxes like sales taxes, rather than advancing a progressive one that hits the lower and middle classes less than the upper class, contrary to all the smoke-and-mirrors styled distractions in the form of GST vouchers and marginal healthcare improvements.There's a reason why the PAP is persistently evasive in defining poverty, and taking concrete steps in acknowledging and tackling the issue."
"A lump-sum payment is actually the form of payment preferred by most economists working in public economics. For example the recent statement signed by 3000+ economists across the political spectrum advocating for a carbon tax states that ""all the revenue should be returned directly to U.S. citizens through equal lump-sum rebates"". If you look at the statistics for household expenditure in Singapore and work through the numbers you will find that the GST vouchers cover a significant part of GST expenditure for the lower income groups. On top of that we must remember that the GST is itself spent on public services, and it is the low-income groups who consume them the most.It doesn't make sense to comment that consumption taxes are ""regressive"" while saying that the GST vouchers are ""smoke-and-mirrors"" when they are the most efficient way of offsetting any regressive effects. And ultimately what is important is how the taxes are spent, not whether the tax is ""regressive"" or ""progressive"" at the point of collection (which is an arbitrary standard). A tax that collects 20% from poor people but 40% from rich people is very ""progressive"", but if it's used to build a golf course in Bukit Timah then that's hardly optimal by most people's ethical standards. A tax that collects 20% from rich people and 40% from poor people is ""regressive"", but if 100% of the revenues are poured into providing free education for poor people then it's the poor who come out ahead, not the rich."
"You're not wrong to say that how taxes are spent is important. It's one argument that some use to justify billionaire philanthropy. For example, the Gates Foundation has a $50b endowment primarily used to on medical services; most countries will likely waste much of that money on ""defence"" instead.Having said that, I disagree that GST vouchers, by virtue of offsetting GST for lower income groups, are better than progressive taxes. They look at two different things - how you earn your money and how you spend it.One problem is that any form of wealth transfer in Singapore is subjected to means-testing. For example, to qualify for the 2019 GST Vouchers, one needs to fulfill criterion assessed for years 2017 and 2018. Your living circumstances two years ago might not reflect where you are now - i.e., someone could be broke at this stage but not qualify.Furthermore, compiling a list of eligible people adds administrative burden.Anyway, I think it's bad to conflate (government) income with (government) spending. And the best way to offset ""regressive effects"" is simply to not have them in the first place."
"The reason many countries tolerate a GST (others usually call it a VAT) even though it is ""regressive"" is that it is relatively efficient and easy to collect compared to the alternatives. So it's like a tradeoff made in a second-best world where the theoretical optimal policy can't be achieved. Most economists agree that a flat rebate is the best way to reimburse those affected by a distortionary tax.BTW, the criteria for receiving the GST vouchers is actually quite broad. The change would have to be quite drastic for someone to be eligible in 2018 but broke in 2019."
"I'd argue that it's not unreasonable for countries to pursue GST/VAT (whatever they want to call a non-discriminatory consumption tax) that excludes basic necessities. In other words, something more akin to ""luxury"" tax as opposed to taxing everything equally. Close by, Australia does this. Fresh food, education, healthcare and government services are GST free.It's actually an ""and"" criteria instead of ""or"". See GST Voucher 2019 Eligibility"
"But it's plausible that you can capture more revenue from richer people by including ""necessities"" and using a lump sum payment to reimburse the poor. Rich people eat too, and they tend to eat more. You can then use the extra money to fund more programs, provide more subsidies, whatever. Furthermore a tax on ""luxury"" goods only is likely to collect less revenues even from just the luxury goods alone, before you even account for the fewer classes of goods covered compared to a catch-all GST. With a tax just on luxuries people are incentivised to switch expenditure away from the taxable goods. With a uniform GST relative prices are not affected (with some minor caveats) and there's nowhere to 'run'.There is also the ease of doing it this way since you won't have firms and small business owners fighting over what gets defined as a necessity or luxury."
"Consumption also has diminishing returns, even for the rich. Beyond a certain point there's not much more to spend on. I agree that a flat GST will definitely capture more revenue, but that doesn't address the lag-time bias in implementing means-testing. Nor does it seem to be ""fair"".What I meant by ""luxury"" is anything that is not a necessity, and includes more than just expensive handbags and haute couture."
"but that doesn't address the lag-time bias in implementing means-testing. Nor does it seem to be ""fair"".The first doesn't seem important in practice, unless you've ever heard of anyone who was really not eligible for the vouchers in one year but destitute the next. The way eligibility is defined is broad enough to preclude that from happening. Even if it did happen it's easily fixed and is hardly a fatal obstacle to the wider policy. Literally any non-universal welfare program will have that ""problem""; the response isn't to scrap them all.Is the latter just a sentiment or are there real reasons for thinking it doesn't ""seem"" fair?"
"""Not only must Justice be done; it must also be seen to be done.""Political support isn't just based on objective measures after all; and besides, if you can be seen to be fair whilst actually doing so, where's the loss?Besides, I trust that neither of us are in any real position to state if current bureaucracy around receiving government aid is onerous or otherwise; yet if one can err on it being as simple as possible, why not?"
"But like I said, literally any welfare program that is selective in its recipients face this issue you raised. Yet no one is calling for an end to free school meals or subsidised education just because some people might be rich in one year and poor the next.The remedy you propose is not just a case of making it as simple as possible, all else equal, because it does entail a possible loss of revenue, and all else is not equal. And I might be wrong but I'm under the impression that you don't think it's a significant loss. I mentioned this before somewhere else: in 2010 the bottom 60% of Singaporean households paid 15.8% of GST collected. The top 40% and foreigners (!) paid the remaining 84.2% of GST collected.That doesn't seem unfair. Also your first point and the quotation seem more like a point about political popularity than the optimality of tax policy."
"As it stands, the top 10% of income earners pay about 80% of the nation's income tax revenue.In YA2017, the top marginal rate was actually increased from 20 to 22% for those earning more than $320,000. That year, half the working population did not have to pay any income tax at all.Just some facts. More can be done, of course."
"Well. Too poor to pay income tax but still rich enough to pay GST on basic necessities - soon to be 9%!Another debate of course, but surely the contradiction is glaring."
Any thoughts on why the government is reluctant any to increase progressive taxes?
Because they themselves are the wealthy elite in Singapore?
basically this.

Investments are not constrained by a lack of capital nowadays in SG. Might be true during the 60s 70s 80s but definitely not now.

"Yea trickle down economics doesn't work (just look at the US, where the trickle down economy definitely has not led to economic equality) - but well, money has a funny way of making things ""work"""
Where's the /s?
In some singaporean hedge fund
How many poor people have money in a hedge fund?
If taxes are too high the rich people just move their wealth into other countries with lower taxes.
There are not many tax havens for them to go to nowadays. Singapore has a lot of conveniences that would be worth putting up with a 1-5% tax rate.
"Probably because1)they want to attract the super rich here to invest. Can't argue with more money.2)More rich pple in SG increasing the wealth gap does not have any tangible impact on the lives of others because they do not compete for the same pool of resource e.g. HDB vs Private Property, public transport vs COE. Even COE is categorized between cheaper and more expensive cars. Unlike say in other nations like Hong Kong where the rich investing in property can totally screw over everyone, it does not happen in SGIncome gap is something that needs to be lowered but in our case, it's not serious enough for the govt to do anything drastic to fix itThe biggest threat income gap will create is ironically PAP's hold on power. If the income gap gets too wide and pple actually feel the impact, pple will start to rebel and get someone else who can fix the issue. Reason for the ""social cohesion"" buzzword used over the last few years. Our numbers may not be looking too good but PAP still have a firm grip is as pointed out earlier(see point 2) income gap doesn't have much impact in SG."

"Just read this. It's good stuff.This isn't a problem just for Singapore. Talking about taxes on the wealthy has become somewhat of a taboo for the whole world.Globalization has created a toxic culture of worshiping the rich. Rich people and powerful megacorporations who have amassed huge amount of wealth, and with the wealth came power. They have completely brainwashed governments into thinking wealth taxes are a transgression on the idea of capital itself.Yet, taxes on consumption and on earned income through labor, which are overwhelmingly paid by the middle class rather than the rich, are perfectly acceptable. IMO, it's time for this to end."
If only we had someone like AOC or Elizabeth Warren to get people hyped up about taxes...
And that cost New York the amazon deal. Companies are gonna avoid states and countries with high taxes. People will lose job opportunies. AOC and Elizabeth Warren are just too extreme with their tax measures. There has to be a balance.
You do know that with Amazon it’s with really vocal opposition to the deal that was given by the city right? It wasn’t about taxes.
"The opposition from the city, as well as New York's left leaning beliefs in taxes played a part in the fallout of the amazon deal. In short, both parties need to find win-win situation to benefit each other. But as it stand, the current political atmosphere is that politicians such as AOC are gaining popularity. These politicians heavily favour socialist ideologies that favour High taxes and strict business regulation. All of which Amazon has taken into account and decided to drop the deal."
"If such high taxes are a disincentive for companies, why do many corporations have huge presences in the city? Maryland was willing to offer close to 3 times more in terms of incentives. But Amazon still chose Crystal City, Virginia."
"Many corporations may have invested in new york, but the entire point that I'm making is that even more would have invested (in this case, amazon) if (future) taxes were less extreme.As for Maryland offering 3 times more, I'm sure that there were other considerations that were factored. It's like if Singapore offered farmers 3x more money to start a Wheat Field in SG. But if our weather, infrastructure and land space can't accomodate farmers properly, no one's gonna invest even if we throw money at them."
"But if our weather, infrastructure and land space can't accomodate (sic) farmers properly, no one's gonna invest even if we throw money at them.Therefore acknowledging that perhaps taxes are not the be-all-end-all determinant of whether rich people will stay in Singapore and keep their wealth here...? Which pretty much implies that perhaps we can tax capital gains and estates to some level."
"Yes, when it comes to investing in ""farmers"", lowering taxes won't help because of our infrastructure, so they have no use for us. But when it comes to, let's say.. startup companies (businesses that can take advantage of our infrastructure). These people are going to look for places that are offering a better deal. If Singapore offers lower taxes, then it'll be a lot more enticing to invest their business here."
"In my humble opinion low taxation is one major reason for Singapore's economic success, and why it ranks among the richest country in the world per capita. All those bankers, investors, fund managers, etc. don't just come here for the sunshine and the nasi lemak."
"Agreed. Low taxes will benefit Singapore in the long term. We are in desperate need for companies to invest in us to provide jobs as there's nothing else for us to fall back on.We all love free stuff. But taxing the rich too much will bite us back in the future. The truth is, it takes a special kind of person with a specific set of skills to run a large company well - and they are extremely rare. Low taxes are one way to encourage these people to come to Singapore."
"people pay attention to their primary source of income, so why care about the local stock when one can attract better. its the same fallacy as so many resource states out there"
"Singapore can't afford to tax the rich too highly. We don't have anything to rely on other than investments from companies to provide jobs.There's this misconception that the rich should be taxed a lot more than everyone else. High taxes on alcohol and tabacco reduces its consumption. So what happens when you tax the rich highly? Less rich people coming to invest, less jobs and it'll just keep snowballing to the detriment of the low and middle class."
The problem the writer is trying to point out is that the rich are not getting taxed.
It depends what the rich is investing on. Not all investments are good.It can be unproductive as well.Anyway SG's banking system has so much savings that capital is hardly scarce and therefore desperately need capital for investments.
Investments from companies and taxing the rich are two different and unlinked things.
"Taxing the rich heavily will discourage investments from them. So yes, they are linked."
"last yr was accepted into tp via EAE. now they sent email telling me to accept my offer by logging in with enrolment key. problem is, so far have never received any sort of enrolment packages, only advertisement by other polys. got any other way to get the enrolment package?edit: thanks for advice, emailed them and they told me to go tp and collect, shag because i live in yishun"

"Hi, best to call student services or you can come up physically to Student Services its at lvl 3 plaza. :)"
thanks hopefully indont get lost
969 go straight to tampines bus interchange then bus over to TP. My life for 3 years when I was there.
This^
The variance is crazy.Wait 5 to 20min for bus 969.Travel time about 45 min to 1 hour 30 min depending if got jam.Wait another 5 to 10 minute for 69 or 158.Take about 15 min to reach TP.Your journey can be a little over 1 hour or more than 2 hours.

Gonna stuff myself with these pies.
They should do a Pineapple Pie using the same filling as those pineapple tarts.
"I tried one in a maccas in Thailand... when I was eating it I felt a bit disgusted but the moment it finished, I found myself wanting more. It was quite odd"
Big Ben's used to do pineapple pies; basically British-style shortcrust pie but with said pineapple fillings. So good.
My (previously sore) throat recovered just in time for this! Missed this previously so I’m hoping to at least have a try this time around.
AWESOME! people expect too much for a chocolate pie that costs less than $2 imo.
Yessssssss
Oh shit finally i can try choco pie. Last time I was sick throughout the whole McDonald's chocopie promo so I didn't get to actually try it

"I have a friend who goes to nearby countries like Laos, Philippines, and takes picture of the poverty there (poor people in poor living conditions, shitty infrastructure, etc). He does it as a hobby or something since he's into travel and photography. Seems really iffy thoughWhat do you guys think of that?"
"I think it's only a problem if he's actively opposed to new devlopments in these villages that improve people's lives because it gives him less to shoot. Actually, I was just reading a book about Singapore in the 1980s which summed up this sort of distasteful attitude in one sentence:The new towns and clean public housing, which provided a healthier and more comfortable lifestyle to the masses than the crowded shacks and slums of the past, held little appeal for the tourist, who missed the picturesque spectacle of other people's poverty."
"the tourist, who missed the picturesque spectacle of other people's poverty.That is probably overly cynical.Many of the old ""slums"" (e.g. Chinatown) were interesting because they were mixed in with other purposes and activities and were not purely residential.Moreover, they were also mostly near the city centre and other attractions so a tourist could pretty much not avoid them.(There is perhaps a similarity here to Bangkok's Chinatown in the present day. Tourists go there because of the attractions, activities, etc. Not just to see a poor and cramped residential area.)"
What book is this? Sounds interesting.
"CM Turnbull's A History of Modern Singapore. It's a textbook, really. V heavy going but also pretty comprehensive."
"As long as he does it in private, and is not condescending towards them in real life or online, I say let him do what he wants. If hespends money there, even better."
"If he's happy with it, he's contributing to their economy through his tourist dollars, and the people there don't mind, then there seems to be no problem."
"Does he go there specifically to take pictures of artefacts of poverty? And if so what are the reasons behind it?I guess that's the kicker. I mean if the dude was there for other purposes and is also into photography, you can't blame him for only having those surroundings to shoot.Whether he does so whilst being respectful towards the locals is another matter altogether."
go watch dark tourism on netflix. your friend is bronze tier compared to them.
"Poverty tourism can be helpful to such communities on the contrary. As long as he is respectful, taking such photos and publishing them can spread awareness and ignite greater compassion in more affluent countries like us. Just a thought."
"I know of people who only like it if their food is off the beaten trail and they are the only white people there. The minute they catch sight of another tourist, they're fully turned off, like as if ""this place isn't fresh and virgin to outsiders"" kinda feel.As long as he isn't like that, I guess it's fine."
Nothing wrong with that. U go over seas to see what you don't have here and slums are something that doesn't exist in sg. As long as you don't flaunt your wealth I don't see what's wrong
"With regards to the poor, as long as he's not bothering them and they're profiting from his spending, sure.With regards to photography, taking pictures of poverty is one of the easiest ways to get ""winning shots"". Snap some wrinkled old person looking directly at your lens, sitting amongst filth because poverty. Tone down everything else but shove up the eye sharpness and vibrancy.If he's smiling, it's heartwarming. Looking tired? Heartbreaking. Staring? So intense."
I personally absolutely detest people who take lots of selfies in their drive by tourism.Seems more self aggrandizing than anything else.Otherwise it's their own business what they do.
"By travelling there and """"exploiting"""" the local population, he's directly injecting money into the country by consuming their goods and services, and indirectly raising awareness for their plights.Maybe it's not a good reflection of character, but it isn't at all detrimental to the people.

"Hi Reddit!My cousin from Malaysia is likely coming to Singapore later this year to study. She's trying to decide whether to take driving lessons and obtain a Malaysian driving license before coming to Singapore.Does a Malaysian license work in Singapore? If not, what does she have to do to drive in Singapore?She's currently 17, so even if she follows the above, can she drive in Singapore?Thanks!"
One is allowed to drive in Singapore only if you have passed your 18th birthday.
Thanks :)
"When she reaches the age of 18, yes, a Malaysian license will work here. Do note that she can drive a Malaysian-registered vehicle as a tourist here, but once she obtains a student pass she isn’t allowed to drive foreign-registered vehicles. (Since a student pass is a form of residency.)If she stays longer than 12 months, she will need to convert her Malaysian license to a Singapore one.Source: LTA"
Ah got it. Thanks!
"Back then what I did was I got my Malaysian driving license at the age of 17 (I'm Malaysian/SG PR), and the moment I hit 18 I went to BBDC, paid $50, took the BTT, and had it converted into a fully fledged Class 3 Singapore driving license. So yes, it can be done."

"Facebook's review board could include Singapore expertsRepresentatives from Singapore are among potential members to sit on an independent board Facebook is planning to set up to review appeals on its content decisions.One area where the board could have oversight would be political content, which a regional centre in Singapore will be monitoring closely ahead of upcoming elections in countries such as Thailand and Indonesia.Details on the board, which is to be established by the end of this year, are being hammered out, Facebook's vice-president of global policy management Monika Bickert told The Straits Times.She was in Singapore yesterday to start a two-day workshop to gather feedback on the proposed board from about 50 representatives from Singapore and the Asia-Pacific. It is being held at the Facebook office in South Beach Tower.More workshops will follow in other cities such as New Delhi and Berlin in the coming months, though Facebook declined to disclosethe identities of the organisations and individuals attending the workshops.When established, the board members of up to 40 global experts and its decisions on appeal will be made public.Users - from individuals to large organisations - can appeal to the board if they want to contest decisions on content that have been removed by Facebook's content review team, or if a post that they have reported for violating community standards does not get taken down by Facebook.Ms Bickert, 42, who leads Facebook's global content policy team, said the board will handle mainly ""edge cases"", which refer to content that may not contravene rules under its community standards at first glance, but which may still be seen as problematic to some communities - or vice versa.One example of such content would be Facebook's widely panned decision to censor an iconic Vietnam War photo of a naked girl escaping a napalm bombing in 2016.ACCOUNTING FOR LOCAL VARIATION Our policies have helped us deal with these edge cases, but it's not perfect because people may say that they will decide differently... That's why we are doing these workshops to figure out how to get truly global representation that can also take into account how content affects people locally. MS MONIKA BICKERT, vice-president of global policy management at Facebook, on the type of cases the planned review board on content decisions will mainly handle.The photo was initially removed as it had contravened Facebook's policy on child nudity, said Ms Bickert.The image was later reinstated and new policies were introduced to allow graphic content that is newsworthy or of public interest to stay up. But similar situations where content may be deemed acceptable or not, depending on cultural context, may still crop up in future.""Our policies have helped us deal with these edge cases, but it's not perfect because people may say that they will decide differently...

"Under changes to the law that took effect in 2013, drug traffickers may escape the death sentence if they are found to have been mere couriers, and if a certificate is issued that they substantively aided the Central Narcotics Bureau in disrupting drug trafficking activities.Literally help us or die.noice."
"40g is about 400 doses of a heroin hit, on the basis of 0.1g per dose. The threshold for capital punishment is 30g. Presumably if you have that quantity and more on you, you may be more than your average pusher, with more intel on the trade. In this case he has also repackaged the goods before. Which means he has handled the raw stuff and has greater involvement in this particular trade. So yes. Help."
I think there's also a possibility one would rather die than get on the bad side of the people dealing with drugs.
I agree. It's really quite an unfortunate damned if you do damned if you don't type situation.
"beats ""or die""."
"One more thing to note is that, if I'm not wrong, the issuance of the CSA (certificate of substantial assistance) is also entirely at the discretion of the courts. So even if a courier does help, he/she may still die."
So who has more power? The prosecutor or the judge?
Prosecution. They can deny you a certificate even if you are a mere courier and the judge will have no discretion but to give you the death penalty and not even the court of appeal can overturn your conviction (which is dumb). This guy's only hope is his presidential clemency which has only been granted twice in history
"No, wrong. The judge has absolute power and the final say. Only thing is that because of the seperation of powers, the prosecutor cannot tell the judge what sentence he should give and likewise the judge cannot tell the prosecutor whether he should give the courier a certificate or not. They cannot discuss these issues so ultimately there is a lack of communication and understanding between both parties on what they want the outcome to be."
What final say? Many a times the Judge finds that the accused is a mere courier but has no choice but to sentence the accused to death as the Prosecutor elected not to grant the accused a certificate of substantive assistance. How can you then say that the Judge still had absolute discretion when it comes to sentencing.
"So... If you are an ignorant courier and you cannot provide information that the prosecutor wants because you don't have it, death?"

"Drug trafficker found to be a mere courier, but apex court upholds death penaltySINGAPORE — The apex court on Monday (Feb 11) ruled a drug trafficker to be merely a courier, but the Singaporean man still faces the gallows as he was not given a certificate of substantive assistance by the public prosecutor.Delivering the three-judge Court of Appeal’s decision, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon disagreed with the earlier High Court ruling that Zamri Mohd Tahir had not proven he was merely a drug courier.There was no evidence to show that Zamri, 44, had resolved to do more than deliver drugs at the point of his arrest, said CJ Menon.Zamri worked for someone he referred to as Abang, and had not received any instructions on what to do with the drugs.When he was arrested on Oct 14, 2014 while trying to exit the car park of Block 606 Clementi West Street 1 in a van driven by a friend, he had only collected and transported five bundles of heroin. The bundles were placed in a red plastic bag in the basket of a bicycle at the void deck.Zamri was found guilty of possessing not less than 40.37g of heroin, or diamorphine, for the purpose of trafficking.According to him, it was the fourth time he had helped to move drugs. The previous time, he had helped to repack drugs.For the latest batch of drugs, Zamri said he intended to do whatever Abang instructed.But the fact remained that no instructions had been given at the point of his arrest, and there was no evidence what Abang’s instructions would have been, said CJ Menon, who ruled together with Judges of Appeal Judith Prakash and Tay Yong Kwang.“It was, in truth, unknown and unknowable what the accused would have done after he had taken delivery of the drugs,” he said.The public prosecutor affirmed on Nov 29 last year that he would not issue a certificate of substantive assistance to Zamri.Under changes to the law that took effect in 2013, drug traffickers may escape the death sentence if they are found to have been mere couriers, and if a certificate is issued that they substantively aided the Central Narcotics Bureau in disrupting drug trafficking activities.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

The Draycott is also something different from the usual boxy and rectangular look of most residential buildings in SG.I Googled its interiors and was very amused at how the layout was like.Although I think it will be very challenging to find off-the-rack furniture should you possess a unit and wish to decorate it. Haha
Sky Habitat btw.
I was looking at it on Propertyguru. Is it just poor photos or are the apartments so small?
The unit I was in was really small.
"Cheers, will cross it off my list"
My IPPT got cancelled due to the safety timeout and my window has closed.I called the hotline but it seems like I keep getting pushed around as they don't know how to deal with this issue.I just received a call that I need to do RT. Infuriating!
"I won't be surprised if their leading reason is, ""Your window is one year, why did you choose to take it last minute"".Oh well."
"Not a big fan of people who use this line of reasoning to justify cutting time, even outside SAF. It just shows that you can't trust their timings."
"Read it in the ""GENNERMAN, WHY YOU CHOOSE TO TAKE IT LAST MINUTE"" encik voice"
They did say that ...
"My last rt window, I started doing it like 4 months before my window closed. I had all my sessions planned out but got a work injury after the 6th session that prevented me from completing rt. still got charged and fined anyway."

"Am a brigade clerk and it's part of my job to put up affected servicemen for waiver request. Whether waiver is granted is case by case and contributing factor is mainly NSmen's defaulter history. But I can tell you out of hundreds of cases that flowed in due to the timeout, 90% gets a waiver if it's for defaulting IPPT/IPT. Exception are those who have defaulted RT, those cases are strictly non-waiver."
"If you can pass IPPT, try asking for your division to schedule IPPT for you. That's what I did in SPF. Can skip the RT requirement."
"heard similar story from friend, ended up in RT"
"If true, it would be really dumb. I would have expected SAF to give a blanket extension to everyone affected since it was SAF's decision to have the safety timeout. Whether the individual could have or should have taken the test earlier is beside the point, they were entitled to have up till the closing of their window and they planned based on that."
"According to the person in charge of our NSmen IPPT/IPT, he waives those with a good record (of passing IPPT or completing IPT), but charges those that have repeatedly failed to do so (skipping third time or skipping RT).Ideal case is to contact your NSmen commander and then escalate up the issue to the relevant person. Failing which, it's up to the fitness trainer whether he lets you take your IPPT during IPT."
"That's still not exactly fair as he's making the assumption that those who have missed or failed previously would continue to do this year if the safety timeout did not take place. They very well may have but we don't know for sure unless they didn't even book the IPPT.I don't blame him though, he's just trying to operationalise it at the ground level in a way he thinks is reasonable. My point is that someone higher up should have just given instructions that those who had IPPT booked during that period will get an extension equal to the length of the timeout or the next available IPPT date whichever is later. At the end of the day NSMEN shouldn't be disadvantaged because of a decision SAF took even if the decision for the timeout was the right one in the interest of soldiers' safety."
"I had the same issue as you but i planned and schedule everything 4 months before due to work and overseas travel. My last IPT was cancelled because of the safety timeout and i was shove to RT instead.Here comes the bad news if your trying to get some sort of help or fix this, i would say give up. I have dealt with them on many occasions and all they can tell you is book early next time or exercise harder next time. So i don't even bother calling them to fix anything anymore."
"My friends (platoon mates) got the same issue, end up getting exempted from that IPPT window after some email-ing back and forth for clarifications, and will be taking IPPT for next window."
"I hope that is how they will resolve my issue.The last call I received was from a lady who seemed like she didn't know what the SOP for a situation like this is and didn't want to put in an effort to escalate it. She just casually told me ""oh no choice I think you just go for RT la"". Only after protesting did she offer to escalate.I have called in three times already and no one wants to properly deal with the problem. Worse than starhub helpline haha"
"I had a friend who had his ippt cancelled as well, then was told the window would extend. Suddenly he was told his ippt would be waive by the unit S8. If u have an NS unit already i would propose going to the commanders there (esp S8 and dy S8 who are in charge of ns manpower), and explain your sitch"
Pardon my ignorance but there's an S8 now?I left SAF when there's up to S4Times sure have changed.
"Yea i was confused at first too! Now there's the standard S1 S2 S3 S4, but for reservist Units there's an S8 and dyS8(DXO level) just to help manage all the admin between cycles when the S1-4 aren't activated. It's kind of like an admin specialist role!"
"Ooh, TIL.Thanks for the info!"
"First session of RT is IPPT anyways, pass that and you clear. Check with the PTI."
I thought it's first session of IPT that's a Ippt? For missed window RT it's 7 training sessions and the 8th session is an ippt?
"That’s correct. RT IPPT is 7, 14 and 20th session."
"The danger of Economics 101 in public discourseThe danger of Economics 101 in public discourseUnderstanding the limits of basic economic theory will help raise the level of public discussion on policies – especially during Budget seasonAs the economics adage goes, there are unlimited wants but limited resources. In any discussion of the Budget, we are constantly reminded of the trade-offs at stake and the values that underpin our social contract as a society. For instance, we may hear that universal social spending would produce unintended negative effects on work incentives or that they are fiscally unsustainable.These economics-sounding arguments are often accepted without question, much like how we are expected to accept scientific claims produced by scientists.But we should resist this temptation. Many economic propositions are more an expression of the speaker’s ideology or dogma rather than empirical fact. Consider, for a moment, some often heard claims about the economy: Free trade makes everyone in society better off; or that minimum wages reduce employment.An economist would react to these statements with much less certitude. He would say that these propositions hold up only under certain (strict) assumptions.But in public discourse, many of these economic propositions are often taken as fact. In debating the value of the recently concluded European Union-Singapore free trade agreement, for example, it is not unusual to hear statements along the lines of “any Economics 101 class will tell you that free trade benefits everyone in society”.But that is exactly the problem: It is precisely because it is Economics 101 that these claims are made without qualification and without any reference to empirical reality.As one of the most popular A-level subjects and a compulsory module in some universities, Economics 101 reaches a significant part of the population. Economics 101, as it is taught in Singapore and around the world, provides a window into the field of economics. Many people encounter ideas along similar lines in casual reading of news reports and commentaries. But it is good to be reminded that a worldview premised on Economics 101 concepts is just one window, not the only window, into the real world.As a simplified model, Economics 101 teaches students about demand and supply and uses the “standard model” of efficient markets to explain a wide variety of economic policies and phenomena – from taxation to auctions, employment, and growth.To be able to hold such wide-ranging explanatory power, Economics 101 is built on a number of simplifying assumptions. It presents a stylised (or simplified) model of the market economy, assumes that people and firms are on average rational, that individuals are armed with sufficient information, working in competitive labour markets that pay them wages equal to their marginal product, and that they derive utility from their consumption.The main job of Economics 101 is to show how the “invisible hand” of the market economy channels the pursuit of self-interest (or profit) by individuals (or firms) to increase the well-being of society.Economics 101 is certainly a useful pedagogical method and even a simple, clarifying lens through which to interpret events and policies. But as a social science that tries to demystify the economy and how decisions of resource allocation are made, this approach may have unintended – even harmful – consequences, especially when people take its explanatory value too far.The students of Economics 101 often forget the simplifying assumptions and remember only its conclusions. They also extrapolate those conclusions to contexts where the (forgotten) assumptions do not hold.Professor David Laibson, head of Harvard University’s economics department, notes that even though there is pedagogical value in teaching basic economic models before moving on to more complex models, “it’s useful to know right from the start that these very strong assumptions are really a benchmark model, not a model that we think accurately describes the world”.PROBING COMMON ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONSHow far off is the standard model from the real world? Let us examine the two economic propositions we started with.First, Economics 101 posits that free trade makes everyone better off because tariffs impose a deadweight loss on consumers and producers. By eliminating some of the mutually advantageous exchanges that would otherwise have taken place, tariffs (which restrict free trade) are economically inefficient or reduce society’s welfare. Free trade – the abolition of tariffs – improves our economic welfare.The Economics 101 student may walk away thinking that free trade always generates a net gain for society and should be pursued in all instances. But this is not necessarily true.The work by legendary economics professor Paul Samuelson suggests, for instance, that tariffs could benefit a large economy such as the United States. In other instances, tariffs may play a distributional role in compensating the “losers” of globalisation.In today’s largely globalised economy, tariffs are less of a trade barrier than domestic regulations (for example, labour standards, consumer safety) and industrial policies aimed at developing infant, indigenous firms or sectors.Even if the case for tariff reduction is clear, it is by no means obvious that the removal of such barriers is necessarily a good idea. A pursuit of free trade in all contexts would not, as Economics 101 suggests, always lead to optimal outcomes.Second, there is often the claim that a minimum wage will lead to more unemployment. In Economics 101, this outcome is explained through the standard demand and supply model – demand is the quantity of labour that employers are willing to hire at different wage levels, while supply represents the quantity of labour that workers are willing to provide at different wages.A minimum wage sets a price (or wage) floor, increasing the quantity of labour supplied and reducing the quantity of labour demanded by employers. The excess supply of labour that results is unemployment: There are workers willing to work at wages below the minimum wage, but firms cannot hire them because of the state-imposed minimum wage. As New Jersey representative Jim Saxton famously said in 1996: “(The minimum wage) hurts exactly those workers it intends to help – the poor, the unskilled, and the young.”The Economics 101 student may walk away thinking the minimum wage always reduces employment, and that the people advocating for it are idealistic do-gooders with no grasp of economics.They would be surprised to know that Nobel laureate for economics Paul Krugman recently stated that “we have a lot of evidence on what happens when you raise the minimum wage. And the evidence is overwhelmingly positive: Hiking the minimum wage has little or no adverse effect on employment while significantly increasing workers’ earnings”.The reason lies in the core assumptions of the standard model in Economics 101. In the “standard model”, firms are assumed to be working in a one-sector, perfectly competitive market. As Cornell University’s professor of economics Gary Fields argued, the effects of decreased labour in the theoretical one-sector market “do not carry over” when the analysis is expanded to include multiple sectors.The assumption of a perfectly competitive labour markets is also problematic. When there is a “monopsony” power (that is, employers having more market power than workers), a minimum wage can increase both wages and employment. This has led some proponents of minimum wage, like Professor Krugman, to suggest that minimum wages are in effect a guard against unfair labour exploitation.Finally, the standard economic model simplifies many complex interactions within employers and employees. If one considers principal-agent problem and other information asymmetries, non-rational decisions, and concepts of fairness and justice in resources allocation, the explanatory value of standard economic model falls even further.This has prompted Professor Joseph Stiglitz, another Nobel laureate in economics, to argue that free markets often lead to sub-optimal outcomes, and that the “market-clearing equilibrium” is only an expression of a theoretical outcome, not an ideal that should be pursued.All this does not mean that the opposites of the two claims above are true. Ultimately, the questions are empirical ones. To shut out the possibility that some restrictions on trade or a minimum wage might be good would be an example of what Professor James Kwak of the University of Connecticut calls “economism”, an acceptance of ideas that are backed up only by simple economic theory but which do not have much empirical validity.The late Prof Samuelson famously wrote: “I don’t care who writes a nation’s laws – or crafts its advanced treatises – if I can write its economics textbooks.”The way economics is taught has always had a major impact on public discourse. But if our discourse is based only on the introductory economics we were taught at school, we run the risk of elevating Economics 101 into an ideology when, in fact, it should simply be a starting point for us to understand how the economy really works.The coming days of discussion about Budget 2019 should not just be a presentation of what the Government plans to do. Hopefully, it will be an opportunity for active citizens to question standard economic assumptions, ask for empirical verification, and challenge the presumption that the Government knows (economics) best.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"
Ehh isn't that the danger of all 101s when used in public discourse? People who know the surface thinking they are god damn experts
"I think it really boils down to school curriculum.The JC curriculum is a huge cause of the problem pointed out in the opinion piece. For one, nearly everybody takes economics in JC. It's one of the most popular subjects, so what it teaches is super influential.Two, it's taught in a fairly prescriptive way. JC economics really doesn't teach you to look at evidence at all. Students are taught to memorize a set of theories and how they would work in an imaginary world. There's only a very surface-level attempt to question how realistic those theories are or how they are supported by evidence (i.e. data).That means you find a lot of false confidence among JC graduates who think their theories are, in fact, universal truths."

In Economics 101, this outcome is explained through the standard demand and supply model—demand is the quantity of labour that employers are willing to hire at different wage levels, while supply represents the quantity of labour that workers are willing to provide at different wages.A minimum wage sets a price (or wage) floor, increasing the quantity of labour supplied and reducing the quantity of labour demanded by employers. The excess supply of labour that results is unemployment: there are workers are willing to work at wages below the minimum wage, but firms cannot hire them because of the state-imposed minimum wage. As New Jersey representative Jim Saxton famously said in 1996, “[The minimum wage] hurts exactly those workers it intends to help—the poor, the unskilled, and the young”.The Economics 101 student may walk away thinking that the minimum wage always reduces employment, and that the people advocating for it are idealistic do-gooders with no grasp of economics.They would be surprised to know that Nobel Laureate for Economics Paul Krugman recently stated that “we have a lot of evidence on what happens when you raise the minimum wage. And the evidence is overwhelmingly positive: Hiking the minimum wage has little or no adverse effect on employment while significantly increasing workers’ earnings.”The reason here lies in the core assumptions of the standard model in Economics 101. In the “standard model”, firms are assumed to be working in a one-sector, perfectly competitive market. As Gary Fields, Professor of Labour Economics and Economics at Cornell University argued, the effects of decreased labour in the theoretical one-sector market “do not carry over” when the analysis is complicated to include multiple sectors.The assumption of a perfectly competitive labour markets is also problematic. When there is a “monopsony” power (i.e. employers having more market power than workers), a minimum wage can increase both wages and employment. This has led some proponents of minimum wage, like Paul Krugman, to suggest that minimum wages are in effect a guard against unfair labour exploitation.Finally, the standard economic model simplifies many complex interactions within employers and employees. If one considers principal-agent problem and other information asymmetries, non-rational decisions, and concepts of fairness and justice in resources allocation, the explanatory value of standard economic model falls even further.This has prompted Joseph Stiglitz, another Nobel Laureate in Economics, to argue that free markets often lead to sub-optimal outcomes, and that the “market-clearing equilibrium” is only an expression of a theoretical outcome, not an ideal that should be pursued.All this does not mean that the opposite of the two claims above are true. Ultimately, the questions are empirical ones. To shut out the possibility that some restrictions on trade or a minimum wage might be good would be an example of what Professor James Kwak of the University of Connecticut calls “economism”, an acceptance of ideas that are only backed up by simple economic theory but which do not have much empirical validity.Paul Samuelson famously wrote, “I don’t care who writes a nation’s laws—or crafts its advanced treatises—if I can write its economics textbooks”.The way economics is taught has always had a major impact on public discourse. But if our discourse is based only on the introductory economics we were taught at school, we run the risk of elevating Economics 101 into an ideology when, in fact, it should simply be a starting point for us to understand how the economy really works.The coming days of discussion about Budget 2019 should not just be a presentation of what the government plans to do. Hopefully it is an opportunity for active citizens to question standard economic assumptions, ask for empirical verification, and challenge the presumption that the government knows best."
Donald Low'sHas he given his 2c on the budget?
Sorry to disappoint all Economics Majors but the reality is that economics is more rightly classed as humanities than proper science.One of the principal assumptions - that agents act rationally - contradicts what happens in reality.
You can go into behavioural economics/game theory for that
Yep. Agree.I think reality is far more complex than broad generalisations. And if exceptions occur on a frequent basis it is certainly our duty to question if basic assumptions are true.Hence the developments of the fields you mentioned above.
"If you're focusing on the practicality of economics (or any other field for that matter), there's always going to be grey areas.Exceptions almost always occur in econs. We use the term ""ceteris paribus"" when talking about topics related to econs because there is always an exception to the rule."
"I'll assert that exceptions occur in all human endeavours - economics included, and medicine (my field) as well - because our actions and intents are diverse. We are not carbon copies of each other who live the same philosophies.Part of the issue with public discourse is that we (as humans in general) are really attached for frameworks that give answers or make predictions. Outliers are usually explained in terms of that framework and we rarely question if the framework itself is valid and applicable.A little knowledge viewed as dogma is a dangerous thing - and I am cognizant of the fact that the statement applies to me as well."
seems like you don't understand why rationality is assumed.
someone let a trade economist out of his office!! quick restrain him!
"So what does the author want? More economics? Less economics? It may be dangerous to assume people are not smart enough to go beyond the 101 and econ soundbites (which, if you take a good 101 class, are anyways quickly disproved), but it is equally if not more dangerous to ask people to stay out of economics since they cannot make heads or tails of it."
He is telling people to be wary of what they think they know.

Bakwa and ...... cheese?
... yes. :\It became brie kwa.
i hope it was gouda though
Good yet so feta-ning...
Cheddar this guy making cheese puns
Well at yeast the puns are good.
A little puns here and there shouldn't do any parm
what the fuck hahahah
"Ngl, I'd totally eat that."
Quelle horreur 0_0
"Well, there's bak kwa pizza. This is the in between step of evolution."
Holy shit I never knew I needed this until today
no it's a pagouda
How was the taste? Wouldn't think to combine with cheese lol
Have tried before. Surprisingly the combination works very well with certain types of cheese. Add wine and you have a winner.
A good whisk(e)y goes amazingly well with bakkwa.Spent last night savoring CNY leftovers with a good tipple.
"Whiskey goes well, but Singapore too hot to drink so much unless we turn down the air con"
"I didn't eat, just saw the leftovers on the pantry and had a good kek"
Not bleu kwa meh? Doesn't look like brie.
oui oui bakwa
Im tempted
Complete with the paiseh piece

Its not new though:https://www.beechenghiang.com.sg/mini-ez-cheese.html
Isn't bakwa with cheese and a fried egg in a frenchtoast sandwich normal?
Sweet bak kwa and savoury cheese sound like a delicious pairing! Topped off with some crusty baguette! Stomach’s rumbling now.
Reminds me of the jerky and cheese pairings or sausage and cheese pairings I frequently saw at convenience shops at the US.
Those are the saltier pairings great with booze. You just reminded me of cheese-filled sausages! Handle with caution when hot. Lol.
Interesting. The Germans in my circle of friends seem to hate it.
The Germans have always hated the French.
Not now though.
You call yourself Prussian but you don’t hate them for having Elaß Lothringen? Interesting.
Make love not war... What’s past is already the past. There is no use in beating a dead horse anymore. We can’t just straight up go to Poland and ask them to give back Danzig/Gdánsk now can we?
I introduced it to my American friends once and they polished the whole fucking box in a day.
How come! I thought they love pork sausages. Bakwa also pork also salty meat what
Actually the complaint I usually get is that it’s sweet
The gist I got from cooking European and East Asian recipes is that perhaps Caucasians better tolerate sour/acidity and East Asian better tolerate sweetness in their respective meat dishes.A European meat dish that calls for vinegar/lemon juice usually means I have to reduce the amount by half for me to find it good.
"There are European dishes that combine sweetness with meat. Random examples:Boar (or venison) comes to mind, it's usually served with lingonberries for me.Bavaria (basically.. what most of the world thinks of when they hear Germany: Munich, Oktoberfest, Schweinshaxen etc..) has white sausages that are commonly served with a special sweet mustard."
"Sweet, but note that it's the sweetness from fruit and honey; not ""seasoning with sugar"" sweet like bakwa."
"British roasts often go with apple/mint/redcurrant jelly, which is basically the same as sweet fruit jam, definitely with sugar added! (Mint leaves aren't even sweet at all.)"
"German here, hate is too strong a word. But yeah, it's not for me.Yep, sweetness is the issue (same with sweet thai sausages for example)."
Well we everything also can put salted egg. Was more of expecting bakwa and wine
SACRE BLEUWell it should taste pretty decent I think
Hello fellow colleague ha
Ayyy
"It's an excellent snack, and pairs well together! My favourite is to have some bak kwa with some plain old hard cheddar as a late night snack"
"I got some blue cheese and bakkwa sitting in the fridge. I've got to try this. Theoretically, salty + sweet should be good."
"My experience with Angmohs, I've yet to meet one who doesn't like Bak Kwa or Kaya"
"It is similar to their beef jerky lor, just more sweet nia.I see ang mo receipe call it as pork jerky lor."
But what did it taste like
so which cheese does it actually pair well with?
Now i really want to try that 😛
Stilton and Bak Kwa...?
Bakwa gonna have a place on chacuterrie boards soon.
And the damnably skillful French will do it better than us. I can guarantee it.
Bakwa is the original & dendeng is the halal version.No food can beat these snacks.Who the heck go & modernised our local snacks.
"try roti john with egg, cheese and bakwa, pretty decent."
"you guys should try grilled cheese with bak kwaits like bacon, but bak kwa"
Ha!What about... durian? gasps
the fuck
"I love Bakwa. I eat it with rice, with bread or as is."
"Try bakwa sandwich, with mayonnaise. It's my go-to, during the CNY period."
Sounds good but holy fk the calories
Calories? Kill them with fire....the fire of exercise!
"Can't be french, I don't see 3-4 bottles of wine"
"There weren't any around, but a couple months ago there was a presentation given to everyone with this hook in the email:""Of course I won't be French if there was no cheese and wine after this is done.There really was cheese and wine."
Bee Cheng Hiang also had those EZ Cheese bak kwa I used to eat.
Waiting for prices to drop before I buy more bakwa to snack on
Had fresh mango on bakwa once. It was amazing.

"Our nature reserves and the nature parks located around the fringes are closed at night to reduce disturbance to nocturnal wildlife. Lots of threatened species live in these areas, such as mousedeer and pangolins, and these animals tend to be more active at night, so the paths aren't lit after 7 pm.It's also for the safety of the visitors, since they might get into trouble with potentially dangerous wildlife such as snakes and wild boar, or end up getting lost, especially those who didn't bring lights with them - see the people who wander off the trails into the forest in the late afternoon, lose their way, and end up spending a night in the forest and need to be rescued."

reddit.com/r/worl...You need to re-read the first sentence from u/hfckz to understand why your argument doesn't make sense

I am honestly cringing right now.
"Not sure if anyone has seen this before but whenever people from the government end up doing a QnA with students, there’s a trend of people trying to “roast” them rather than actually point out flaws in their governance. To me, this is a bit evident when there’s hypocrisy in what they say and that they don’t really have any information about what they’re talking about.For example, last year I was at SIM for Model UN and there was a dialogue session with Tan Chuan-Jin. There was a guy who raised a question about how the government doesn’t do enough to help certain races in Singapore. His response: “Do you help out in the community?” Basically shut him down and proceeded to ask questions which the guy had no idea how to answer.However, while I do agree that it is fair to point out the hypocrisy in students, I feel like it’s also just a way for them to effectively demean their arguments and make it not seem legitimate. At the same time, while I sometimes feel that whenever students ask these questions pointing out problems without really caring about these issues and only wanting to attack the government, it doesn’t mean that their arguments don’t have any value and if they had more research, they could better defend themselves from these aggressive tactics.Thoughts?"
"basic debating and magic skills, you cant let them command the flow of attention, grab the steering wheel and pull everything back in line. point out to everyone that theyre going off course and reassert the initial question.you see this enough times one major interviews overseas"
As the person who asked the question. A lot of people came up to me afterwards asking why I didn't say this or that (or why I just said okay when he asked if his answer was sufficient). Truth is I was legit scared whether there would be any repercussions for my actions (looking at you ISA). Check my comment for more information on what happened.
hi jael how was NTUMUN ICJ
"If you were afraid of repercussions, why did you even ask it in the first place? The ISA isn't for these kinds of questions anyway.Would you be alright if you found out (or it became factual that) that you were hired or not hired as a result of your political leanings? Even if an employer is not in support of PAP, it cannot be seen to nor does it want the risk of having official work that is against the establishment, which is a valid reason along this train of thought. Your fears would also be much more grounded in reality if this is what you meant by 'repercussions.'"
"props for even asking. i admit i wouldn't dare to even ask. it's easy for others to nitpick and criticise you especially when they weren't there themselves (already have some in this thread), but you're probably already more daring than most singaporeans."
Just wanted to say that I didn’t mean to target you specifically if there are any ideas that I did. It just came to my mind as I had gone for a non-MUN thing but similar things happened where students went up and tried to roast while the speaker dodged.I actually saw someone get “roasted” similarly at SMC last year by him but I guess not a lot of people picked up on it. Tan Chuan-Jin was the speaker then and brought the same argument up.
"Take comfort in knowing that those people could have followed up on your initial question themselves, but lacked the balls you had to even step up."
"I’ve not really seen this being discussed in the thread, but I’ve seen this happen twice with CCS and Shanmugam, essentially asking the student if he had a solution (I believe on falling birth rates) and to contact them if he does."
"Dunno if you can even call what our politicians do ""debating"". At least I watch Ben Shapiro got some flair."
If they did youtube will be flooded with PAP MINISTER DESTROYS OPPIES WITH FACTS AND LOGIC
"Hey, I'm the guy who asked the question to Mr Tan Chuan-Jin. I noticed that the comment section is divided on whether a person's credentials (e.g., do they help the community) should determine the validity of their questions.I wanna give a bit more detail as to what happened: This was UNASMUN, held at SIM at around 18 December. Mr Tan Chuan Jin was our guest of honour, and he was now open to questions from the floor. My question was something like this:""From 1966 to 2005, there have only been 14 non-Chinese president' scholars.Malays have consistently ranked the lowest out of all races in the percentage of 5 O level passes.We have not had a Malay president in 5 terms, and even then that was a walkover(no contest)Mr Tan Chuan Jin, Do you not believe that there is discrimination of some sort within the Singapore system that adversely hurts the Malay population?""Firstly, I asked this question because as a neighbourhood school student, I'm no stranger to ethnic stereotypes and dislike the education system at large. I wanted to know what Mr Tan, as speaker of the Parliament, what the government thought about this ethnic divide.Was I trying to ""roast"" Mr Tan? No, but I was asking a difficult question that I thought would be a fun and memorable experience. (certainly didn't think a Reddit thread would be made about it)Okay, anyways like the thread above he asked me whether I did anything to help my community. I said this:""No, I don't do volunteer work. However, I call out stuff that I see is wrong.""I notice that there's a lot of talk about whether asking this question was right.Personally, while I don't take offence at the question, It was an ad hominem mistake and didn't help answer the question. (attacking me rather than my logic)After which, he gave his answer to my question which was frankly a bit lacking in my opinion.It went something like this:""What are we supposed to do then? Are you in favour of affirmative action? I believe that all schools are good.... something like that"" (His answer wasn't exactly like this, was two months ago so can't remember) The main point was that the question on discrimination wasn't answered.I think the government should be a facilitator of civil debate, and shouldn't needlessly subject every person to a ""virtue index"" based on whether or not they do volunteer work.If the government truly wants a generation of well-reasoned leaders and to curb the spread of ""fake news"", they should stop preaching and start answering so-called ""stupid"" questions.This post is way longer than I expected, but I also want to add that I've met Mr Tan again at the REACH Youth Leadership Dialogue and I now better understand and even respect his emphasis on his practical do-don't-talk way of arguing."
"As someone who paid attention during this specific portion of UNASMUN Q&A, I want to first and foremost commend you on asking your questions, which I failed to do in our many IRL interactions. As much as TCJ ended up not answering your question directly, I think other people in this thread have covered why this is the case. The articles you have linked as well as your comment has made for an interesting read and genuinely, if you had been more articulate during the Q&A, TCJ himself would have been put in a much tighter spot.This, plus being on the recieving end of your actions in Crisis in Municipal make me truly believe that you have something very valuable to add to any discussion and I wish you all the best in chairing GGC. I'll see that entire mess later this week while I slowly sip my Russian tea in UNSC.also u hav big gay"
john u have biggest gay
no u
"How our PAP has survived so long is by dodging potential landmines. A straight answer is beyond them in open Q&As because it would commit them to a position they might not want to be in.Eg.Mr Tan Chuan Jin, Do you not believe that there is discrimination of some sort within the Singapore system that adversely hurts the Malay population?If ""yes"":What have they done about it?If ""no"":Then how do you explain the abovementioned issues?Race is a especially sticky topic that no one wants to answer, lest it burn their political ambitions."
lest it burn their political ambitions.Lol TCJ's political ambitions was long burned.
and thank goodness for that.
FWIW I like him better than CCS.
"that's quite a low bar lol. but to play devil's advocate. ccs might be crass and un-statesman-like, but tcj can be as condescending as ccs under the veneer of eloquence. on top of that he's also quite unabashed about being a pious christian - according to the grapevine that's partly why he got sidelined. he's also quite petty from the way the replies to negative comments on his facebook."
"Don't see how pious Christian and his various remarks including cardboard ""gate"" squares up. Sounds more like a Pharisee."
Yeah that’s what I heard as well re: the Christian thing. Lol I still rem his cardboard collection saga.
"good point.While I do not approve of the way TCJ replied, that question is a very sensitive one to answer. I can understand why he wouldn't want to answer it at that point in time.Consider that his reply might show he got caught off guard and became defensive. He's being evaluated by his party too and it's been clear to everyone that he's not doing as well as others."
"I agree that it's a difficult topic. In a perfect world, ministers would answer difficult questions frankly and try to reach solutions.I do understand why he attacked my credentials--it was the easy way out."
"From comments to this, I have not really seen any that seems to go from what they think of TCJ's point of view, or at least, what I believe to be TCJ's point of view.I do believe that if TCJ did respond with that, he did not directly answer your question.However, TCJ is a person who has some belief regarding volunteer work. Notwithstanding the answer to your question, I believe TCJ is of the opinion that volunteer work is what is needed to uplift the Malay population statistically.The link between ""Do you volunteer?"" as a question and your question is that ""What is it that must be done to improve this situation?"" which is clearly more important to some people and not so much to others. In any case, an answer of ""Yes"" or ""No"" would have been insufficient anyway, while an answer of ""Inequality in outcomes is not predicated by an inequality of opportunities, and that I believe that we do have racial equity in Singapore"" might not convince. This conversation would also just end unless you have even further evidence that Malays have, in practice, less opportunities to succeed and that the Government is somehow furthering this inequity. Obviously, I cannot speak from TCJ's mouth, but I think I understand his response.Personally, I believe most forms of 'volunteering' in Singapore do not stem from altruism, but serve as calculated steps for furthering oneself. Without altruistic purposes, 'volunteering' cannot possibly achieve any aims regarding actual progress or helping people in society. From what I heard of some of his speeches, TCJ seems to believe that (better) management of 'volunteering' will help Singapore (more). I would agree, but I would not believe that there would be any significant impact on society at large, managed or not."
"I'm not sure what you expect him to say. Think about what answer you hope to get.Do you want him to say that ""yes malays are purposely saboed in Singapore!""? I find that at a lot of these platforms, youths who often have little access to real govt data and initiatives (be it lack of publicity or lack of interest) just ask stupid questions or stay quiet. Stupid questions are those types of questions that are a) out to troll or b) out to humble brag or score points or c) answers that require actual data that no one has on hand or d) questions based on wrong assumptions from the start due to ignorance."
"The volunteer programmes within the community are often initiated by PA and supported by the government. They represent the government's efforts to help underserved families. Without participating in them or even knowing about them, can you say the government isn't doing anything (something implied in the way you asked your question)?Second, the factors produce the statistics you talk about are unknown to you. You say you're a neighbourhood school student. Have you interacted with the demographic you speak of? Have you seen their home environment? Without having done that, what allows you to conclude that the problem is a discrimination in the school system?It's a reasonable follow-up by TCJ because how he responds depends on how much you already know about the topic coming forward."
"I don't agree when you say I require experience working at volunteer programmes to be ""qualified"" to ask a question.Firstly, I asked for whether the government believes there is ethnic discrimination. I didn't comment on whether the government is doing enough.It's a haughty line of logic- what if I did volunteer but only volunteered for a day? Would it be ""significant""? What gives Mr Tan the divine right to decide my worthiness to ask a question?I recall a wheelchair-bound student asking questions to Mr Tan Chuan-Jin; if he had asked the same question as me - would he be required to have volunteer experience to ask questions?In fact, this whole idea of requiring ""qualification"" makes no sense. You weren't there; nor do you seem to have done any research into ethnic discrimination and you don't even know Mr Tan - what makes you ""qualified"" to comment?"
"Honestly, TCJ completely missed the mark with his ""comeback"". I don't see the relevance between you helping your community, and the systematic disadvantages that certain ethnic groups face in our society.They're largely unrelated topics, and even if we were to assume some sort of qualification or experience is required to ask that question, experience with grassroots and volunteer programmes wouldn't provide useful knowledge or even empirical evidence about ethnic discrimination in our society, asides from a few anecdotes or stories that wouldn't be of statistical significance anyway.Good on you for speaking your mind and asking the questions you wanted to."
"I can understand why TCJ answered the way he did though. It's a bit condescending but you have to understand that these PAPkia and their pals essentially all ""volunteered"" their way to the top. Unpaid work at the grassroots etc. It's quite natural they wil think ""wow si ginna just stay home play computer now say they disadvantaged wtf"".That said, there is certainly a lot out there you can only experience first hand. I guarantee TCJ has met more poor people than you, average middle class person. These PAP kia literally spend a lot of time getting mobbed by poor people at MTP sessions."
"Had I been in TCJ's position, I would have asked you, ""Are you aware of Mendaki and what they do?"" Fun fact, I don't even volunteer and I know the answer to that question.No, you just need to do your research. Maybe TCJ was trying to give you a diplomatic way out."
"Jael, consider ""thatfeelingmakes"" is part of the ""PAP Internet Brigade"". The flawed logic about not participating is typical and that last sentence is a giveaway.I haven't been to Disneyland, but I hear its fun.I do understand why he didn't want to answer though, see my other comment in this thread."
"Jael, consider ""thatfeelingmakes"" is part of the ""PAP Internet Brigade"". The flawed logic about not participating is typical and that last sentence is a giveaway.An ad hominem attack, ironically in support of someone complaining about ad hominem. The cognitive dissonance is real."
"The politician could have answered by citing some governmental initiatives at boosting volunteerism. The student was not obliged to volunteer but the politician as a representative of the government was obliged to answer, provide more information or inform or educate the student."
"He's not all correct but still, do specify HOW this is happening, I do think that discrimination and racism is way overplayed. (It definitely still exist)"
Every one has the right to question. Whether or not we volunteer is besides the point. That was very bad answering technique.
Whataboutism is very common.
Doesn't mean it's healthy for intellectual discourse.
"All Politicians do that, nothing to be alarmed about. There’s nothing wrong with “roasting” your critics of their question has already been answered elsewhere and the “question” is actually a statement meant to provoke the person being questioned."
"As the person who asked the question, I agree that ""roasting"" can be fine if they came up and directly roasted you first. I've written a small post with the question I asked and you can see that I didn't ""roast"" Mr Tan. I would be fine with him ""roasting"" me if he still answered the question but he didn't. I don't take offense but the whole idea of a Question and Answer session is to answer questions and frankly it's unproductive to just ad hominem arguments"
"Yes I agree with you in principle. But on the facts that you put in your post, I think a little light reminder to the student to “guilt-trip” to volunteer more is good. Sometimes as a volunteer, I find it irksome that people who don’t do anything like to question why the government can’t do “more”. Because only if you are on the ground you can understand what “more” can be done and you understand sometimes why “more” cannot be done.Maybe he shouldn’t have thought of it as roasting and more of an answer to his question in a roundabout way. Help out, understand what has been done, then ask why this “more” can’t/hasn’t/should be done.His question (from what I read in your post), seems to ask why “not enough” has been done for certain races. It presumes that “not enough” had been done, and it is only right for one to question why the presumption was made. Was it made based on research, what the student saw on the ground while volunteering? Depending on the follow up questions, asking about experience in volunteering may not constitute ad hominem attacks."
"For example, last year I was at SIM for Model UN and there was a dialogue session with Tan Chuan-Jin. There was a guy who raised a question about how the government doesn’t do enough to help certain races in Singapore. His response: “Do you help out in the community?” Basically shut him down and proceeded to ask questions which the guy had no idea how to answer.It’s because the student asked a loaded question, You do not answer a loaded question. You challenge the assumption behind the loaded question."
"The assumption would be that the govt doesn’t provide enough help, not whether the asker helps in their community?The right way to answer would be to show how the govt does enough (or does what it can within its limitations etc.) or clarify what the asker means by “not enough”, why the asker thinks so and go from there."
Just part of the tradition.https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8iiyue/lee_kuan_yew_tells_female_phd_candidate_to_find_a/
"These are legitimate questions. It doesn't matter what the asker's credentials are. This is a very common tactic used by government officials to bully students.In fact, the student should have asked: ""How much did the current PM help out in the community when he was a student?"". If Tan Chuan-Jin had said that he doesn't know, then the rebut should have been: ""Why do you let him be your boss in the government if you know so little about him?""."
"""He inherited it."""
"These are legitimate questions.Not really, this is a classic ""have you stopped beating your wife"" type of question. It's only natural that TCJ will challenge the assumption (that the govt isn't helping certain races sufficiently) behind a loaded question like this by asking about the questioner's background in such matters.In fact, the student should have asked: ""How much did the current PM help out in the community when he was a student?"". If Tan Chuan-Jin had said that he doesn't know, then the rebut should have been: ""Why do you let him be your boss in the government if you know so little about him?"".As far as comebacks go, this is a rather poor one that doesn't make any sense at all.Why is it the subordinate's responsibility to know what his boss did decades ago in school?TCJ wasn't the one who chose LHL as PM; he wasn't even in politics when LHL became PM."
"I don't see how tcj gave a good reply at all? If during employee appraisal, your boss were to tell you didn't contribute enough and ask what you did for a project, do you think it's a good answer to reply ""How exactly do YOU contribute to this company?""TCJ's reply should have been to ask for details on why he felt certain programmes weren't doing enough to help."
I don't see how tcj gave a good reply at all?Nice straw man. I never claimed that TCJ’s reply was good.My point was that it’s not illogical for TCJ to ask about the student’s volunteering experience if TCJ wanted to find out the background behind the student’s assumption/loaded question.
"Nope. The student's background should be irrelevant to the question. Why should it matter?If TCJ believes that the government is doing enough, then he could have just given a few examples and be more diplomatic. Why so hostile to a student?I don't understand how people can condone their politicians speaking to them like that. They are not our bosses."
"Nope. The student's background should be irrelevant to the question. Why should it matter?If TCJ’s intention was to belittle the student and use the student’s lack of volunteering experience to disqualify the question, then yes I would agree with you.But based on what was described, I don’t think that was necessarily the case. For one, there’s no way TCJ would have known about the student’s lack of volunteer work beforehand. If the student had answered yes, then TCJ wouldn’t have been able to avoid the question (if that was even TCJ’s intention in the first place).As I’ve explained above, another logical possibility is that TCJ was trying to understand the student’s background to see how the student came to the conclusion about certain races being systematically discriminated against. Without a transcript of the exchange, I don’t think we should jump to the conclusion that TCJ was trying to roast the student."
"""actually point out flaws in their governance"", how is this the correct thing to be done??If you have a legit question, then ask. But using the opportunity where you can ask questions to assert your opinion that something is done wrongly isn't right either.An actual question is, why is something not being done in ___ way because I feel like ___ has many advantages.A shitty question is, Singapore has a problem, why haven't you solved it?The first question allows for a discussion, but the second already asserts the assumption of poor governance. In debates, the opponent will choose to attack the question, instead of countering your arguments because the question is already biased."
"I think the Minister would just like the student to substantiate his question. Was he in some voluntary organisation when he experienced that gov was not providing the required assistance and if he is aware of the current assistance which gov have already rendered for that group.If the student have not done his homework, there's no need for the guest to entertain pre conceived impressions."
"TBH depends on how the question is asked.If the student had gone “The government doesn’t do enough to help ___ race.” then the logical question to ask is, on what basis has he made this judgement? Does he help out with the community and already knows what policies there are in place, and/or is aware of cases that slip through? If yes, good, comments welcome. If not, then it’s just backseat driving without even having looked at the map, right? Plus it’s a pointed question that’s pretty low-level and does not engender discussion.If the student had gone “There have been comments that the Government has more to do to help ____ race.” that’s a more open question for discussion.I do think maybe there should have been follow-up discussion on the matter, but I wasn’t there, so can’t judge either way."
"I'm a little bit late to the party, but I'm the guy who asked the question to Mr Tan. If you check my comment, I actually gave evidence within my question and I tried to frame the questio as broadly and openly into a discussable topic as possible."
"it’s a pointed leading question. No debater would engage without blunting the barb. This is not an open question.calling out what you believe is wrong - without giving causation, and not correlation, arguing for your conclusion - isn’t calling out. It’s jumping to indefensible positions. If you had further proof points you should either craft your leading question better, or follow up with more responses after his initial."
"If I was Tan Chuan Jin, I also won't answer the question."
"Answer 1: these people are students who have no idea what they are talking, shutting them down is easier. I also heard a similar tactic by [redacted] who used to ask every student who asked questions whether he or she has a gf or bf or not, even though it is irrelevant to the question.However, I guess this is one way of taking questions? There are some questions where the minister might not understand well enough to answer comprehensively, or that there are policy decisions yet made that the minister is reluctant to answer. Also, it might paint the minister in too bad a light that refusing to answer is probably the way to go. After all, they are also humans. And looking at the question, it probably is a question the minister has no full picture what is happening and believes it to be more anecdotal than actual fact. Even if you throw me the question I also blur."
oh I heard that one before. after that will say see you aren't contributing to xxxx
"cannot convince, confuse.understand ?"
I think students should research before hand before asking. Especially at the tertiary level.
"As the guy who asked the question, I provided prior research to justify my claim. If you check my comment, you can see the question I asked. I agree that we should all provide some research to support our claims. The problem was that Mr Tan did not provide a satisfactory answer and instead just asked for volunteer experience."
"Probably taking a leaf from Teo Chean Hean's ""What do you think"" remark at a similar session years ago"
I never understood what was wrong with Teo chee hean asking that. If the student doesn't know just say don't know.. If he has an opinion he can share it.
Snarky would be appropriate to describe such a remark Student was asking him a question and he got this as a reply
It’s like saying for me to know for you to find out.
"There was a guy who raised a question about how the government doesn’t do enough to help certain races in Singapore. His response: “Do you help out in the community?” Basically shut him down and proceeded to ask questions which the guy had no idea how to answer.seriously fuck this mindset of you haven't do so you can't criticise. it shuts down any debate, and distracts from the mission of an elected government - to serve the people. we elected you to do the job - not ask us if we can do your job!"
Except tcj wasn't implying that. Tcj was probably trying to dig out more about how the student knows that the government wasn't helping certain races enough.
"fair enough. we weren't there and we can't discern his tone, but it certainly can be interpreted many ways - one of which is combative and defensive. even if he was trying to dig out how the student knows, he can surely afford to be more gracious instead of sounding so defensive and aggro."
"seriously fuck this mindset of you haven't do so you can't criticise.As someone who's been in a similar position, in a forum setting there is often no time to give you a lecture in Helping the Poor 101. You are in a place like Model UN, it's assumed you've done your research. Don't even need to actually get dirty, just a simple ""No, but <whack sources here>"" is enough.How the relevant office holder responds to THAT would then classify a ""roast"" or not."
"fair point. but i think we need to give young people a break. especially someone who actually dared to speak up to a politician in person. beating them down when they ask a question, even if it's somewhat accusatory, doesn't foster a healthy politicial climate imo. and the person who asked the question has posted about the entire exchange in this thread - i didn't think it was out of line at all."
"If they want to stand out on the platform as a politician and can't even handle hecklers or people ""roasting"" them with direct queries, then maybe they should reconsider their ambitions. I don't really like watching political debates, but I've seen enough to understand that good speakers and people who can handle their own know how to redirect uncomfortable queries into something that matches their agenda and control the flow of the dialogue sessions. If they only want Yes-man who only point out their good at their sessions, they should have picked their audiences next time."
lmao unasmun?
"delegates, delegates, delegates"

ok buddy
"i’m not your buddy, pal"
There was a guy who raised a question about how the government doesn’t do enough to help certain races in SingaporeAnyway the answer for this according to current govt stance is:Community groups will take care of their own communityGahmen give grants and shapes policy to make reduce inequality and help all Singaporeans who need help
True but they might be doing it because it might be awkward if no one participate in Q and A
"Yes, he is using whataboutism. The flip side in such debates about inequality, though, is that there is always a certain group of people who like to stand in false solidarity with the weak.https://www.allsingaporestuff.com/article/lee-kuan-yew-always-put-singapores-interest-first-he-revoked-pr-troublemakershttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6577765/David-Cameron-Costa-Rica-Theresa-Mays-Government-sent-Brexit-meltdown.htmlhttps://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/02/08/2198570/jacob-rees-moggs-huge-personal-windfall-after-brexit/"
"More info needed since nothing is said about the ""roasting"" for us to actually comment."
"His response: “Do you help out in the community?”This is just ad hom fallacy. The student's deeds has nothing to do with the thrust of his question.However it works because people are not thinking logically, but with their hearts when it comes to debates.Might as well ask whether the student pay taxes since he wants Government to use more funds to help the community."
"It has merit if the student's accusation is baseless. Based on what statistics and sources has the student come to the conclusion that the government is not doing enough? In the age of fake news and easily-shared facebook/whatsapp misinformation, I think it's legitimate to tease out these assumptions. If the student had been someone who is deeply involved in work with minorities, with first-hand experience, then yeah, his assumption then holds a lot more weight.Now the tone perhaps could have been less combative. But this is subjective."
"It has merit if the student's accusation is baseless.This is not a defense against ad hom arguments.If it's so obvious that the student has his stats/source wrong, then it would be easy for TCJ to dish out the stats.I see another poster said such questions is akin to asking ""have you stopped hitting your wife"", but even this sort of question is not hard to disprove by simply saying ""I never did hit my wife to begin with"", instead of ""oh, you wanna ask about me hitting my wife? When was the last time you stopped hitting your wife?"""
Of it is baseless then point out that the argument is baseless. Don't need to go on a roast
LOL it happens. it pisses me off that they always belittle students
"Depends on how question was asked because some people like to create injustices out of nothing.In the first place why must government help be related to race? If people need help then it shouldn't matter what race they are. People who need financial assistance should qualify for it based on their income. I feel like when the guy claimed that certain races are not helped enough, he was going down the slope of the racial politics that we've seen so much in our neighbour up north. It's a very common argument made by Mahathir and his gang right? ""We are too easy going and nice that other races are taking advantage of us so we need bumi advantage""You're right that questions should be answered, but sometimes you got trouble makers who are not there to ask questions but are there to create problems. Remember that time when some guy from r/aznidentity came here and accused Singapore of being pro white and racist? Some people just got a few screws loose and sometimes being sincere with them don't work.I guess Tan Chuan Jin should have answered him properly, but sometimes patience might run low?"
"In the first place why must government help be related to race? If people need help then it shouldn't matter what race they are. People who need financial assistance should qualify for it based on their income.I actually managed to ask Gan Kim Yong about something similar when he came to my school when I was still a secondary school student! (haha it's quite a while back, can't recall if he came as an MP or because of some other position). The answer I was given is that some assistance is by community organisations like CDAC, mendaki, Sinda so that's why they are tagged to the community. I remember he was quite friendly about it but this was in a small group interaction sorta thing instead of a forum."
I am sure OP is not looking for text books answer
A textbook answer might have been better than how TCJ answered.
"Usual one lor, can see same thing at chief of army dialogue. In the end, my reaction is simply you say anything also can lor, I can't win you one."
LOL after knowing TCJ for years. Talk to him for at least 10 mins and you will end up talking about volunteeringHes very predictable actually.
So I think that the government is doing so to help other races of u disagree pls share ur opinions
Last year and you only mentioned it now. Why huh?
Can’t say where but my own school had a politician come down for a talk. I can’t remember the name because in all honesty because he was from an area of the government I wasn’t interested in. But my own school mates asked questions irrelevant to his area which got me thinking.
"So if you are not sick or haven’t been hospitalized, you have no right to ask a question about medical subsidies?"
"When you asked a question in a group, whether is it in a school, work or community, please ask yourself what are your intentions."
"“Do you help out in the community?”What kind of nonsensical response is that? He's the one being paid tons of tax dollars, not the student. Reminds me of Ng Eng Hen's famous 'What do you think?' from many years ago."
What do you think?
Expect someone to answer such question... And yet suck thumb when being asked a quesiton. Keh kiang
Sometimes it gotta hurt before it works.
"At the end of the day, they are there to serve the people and country and shouldn’t view being questioned negatively."
Can't wait to bring my pet cat around. Going to call it Grabbing my pussy from now on.
"I used to take Uberpets when I had to transport my two dogs, because I can't carry them both in carriers. If this goes the same way, it'll be having to wait 15 to 20 minutes for a car that costs significantly more than a regular car and often getting cancelled on because the drivers decide it's just too damn far to drive an empty car to come pick me up. Here's hoping that they can at least have sufficient drivers to meet the demand and have them spread out over the island, but I'm not holding my breath. I just checked and the same ride to the vet would cost $8 more using GrabPets than JustGrab."
"I mean you can’t expect to charge low, and still go out of their way to do this for you. Maybe if they increased the prices more drivers would be willing to do it"
"My comment was to share about my experiences with a similar service, kinda like a mini review. It's not a complaint, it's what I experienced as a rider with two dogs. I've elaborated further here on the topic, given that I take Grab fairly often with my older dog, who has regular reviews at the vet.They have increased the prices, significantly. Based on that trip I looked up, it's $8 more to go from Toa Payoh to Siglap, so $20 instead of $12. And because we have not much choice in the matter, pet owners will still take the service, because at least now there won't be cancellations by drivers who refuse to have a dog in their car, or drivers who very grudgingly take you and end up complaining to you for the entire trip about some bad trip they had with a dog owner once and you're just sitting there with your dog in her carrier sleeping in your lap wishing you had the money to just buy a damn car. You know, the way most people do when they encounter a problematic driver, except when you have a dog in tow, the chances of such an encounter go up quite a bit. So here's hoping that jump in price will mean no more such unpleasantness, so it's a $8 tax to just take a peaceful ride, but it's still cheaper than buying a car.But then there's the issue of wait time. My max with Uberpets was 30 minutes. And this was after two cancellations. So 30 minutes of just sitting there at the vet, waiting for a car. Usually it was more like 15 to 20 minutes, because even though they made it more expensive, many drivers don't want to sign on to Uberpets because they don't want their car to be dirty, so there weren't many drivers on the road and they'll be a town or two away, like in Bedok when you're in Tanjong Katong (true story, BTW). Granted, they didn't get that nifty care package with the seat cover and all that, and Uberpets was just $2 more as opposed to a $14 minimum and an unknown amount more, so hopefully there will be more cars for GrabPets. Although ""hundreds of drivers"" according to the article isn't really that many, so here's hoping more drivers sign up for it.This service is necessary for big dog owners and owners with multiple dogs because previously it was always tricky getting a ride with anything but a small dog in a carrier. This service is also necessary for drivers who cannot and/or will not have pets in their car for whatever reason, because at least now they have the right (one hopes) to legitimately cancel on a job if they have a pet with them. Previously they had to hope that the rider would cancel for them, especially because the Notes to the Driver only came up after the job has been auto-accepted (if they didn't have auto-accept on, they can see the notes before they accept, or so I was told). It protects drivers from owners who don't take care to place their pets in carriers or provide their own seat protectors if their dog couldn't fit in a carrier, because they either choose to not be part of it at all, or now they have a company issued mat, which costs like $15 on Lazada.It punishes dog owners who are responsible and take steps to ensure that their dog doesn't dirty the car or leave a smell. If this had popped up three months ago, when my dog was still going for daily reviews at the vet for her eye surgery, this would have been an additional (15 visits x 2 ways each x $8 =) $240. Which, well, would have paid for about two more reviews. I did have some bad rides during that period, even though for 90% of the rides, it was just her sleeping peacefully in her carrier on my lap all the way there and back. The other 10% she was still sleeping peacefully, it was just that the driver was feeling the need to tell me about his previous run ins with dogs and bad owners, like some kind of preemptive warning to bad behaviour."
Have you tried RYDE Pet? I find it less expensive than this new Grab Pet.
"I have rather bad luck with Ryde; I seem to often have problems getting a car with them. Then again, this was a while back."
Will the cars which are being used for Grabpet be allowed to ferry regular passengers as well? Foresee some issues for passengers with pet allergies if this is the case.
"MRT train evacuated after phone emits smokeA train at Dhoby Ghaut MRT station was evacuated yesterday, after smoke was spotted coming out of a passenger's mobile phone.The cause of the smoke was probably accidental and electrical in origin, said the Singapore Civil Defence (SCDF), which was called in to help investigate the phone after the incident.No fire or injuries were reported in the incident, which happened on the North-East Line, said rail operator SBS Transit.Passengers were evacuated as a precaution, said Ms Tammy Tan, senior vice-president of corporate communications at SBS Transit.The SCDF and the Public Transport Security Command were also activated as a safety measure in response to the incident, said SBS.The SCDF said its help was not required at the station.The affected train was sent back to the depot.A Straits Times reader, who declined to be named, said he was in the train and standing about 1m away from the owner of the phone, when smoke starting coming out of the device, which was in the man's back pocket.The train was moving towards Dhoby Ghaut MRT station.""The phone owner was just chatting with another two friends. But suddenly, he struggled to retrieve his phone, before throwing it down onto the floor,"" he said. ""Thick smoke was coming out from the phone, but there was no fire.""He said the phone burned a slight hole in the owner's pocket, and the owner had soot on his hand after the incident.At Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, passengers disembarked and two station staff helped move the crowd safely out of the train, he said.It is believed that the phone model was an Honor, a smartphone brand under Huawei.Mr Larry Yeung, 31, who was also on board the train, said: ""Everything seemed normal, but after the train doors closed, they opened again.""The train stopped for about a minute or so, and soon after, the announcement came to request that all passengers get off the train.""Mr Yeung, who works with design methodologies to solve problems, said the reason for the announcement was not stated and that commuters were calm throughout the entire incident.The train then left the station.While the disembarkation of the train meant that the platform was ""very crowded"", Mr Yeung said that there were no delays affecting the line and the subsequent train came in about 1½ minutes.""I was lucky to get on the next train, but I saw that some didn't manage to get in,"" he added.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"
"Even ignoring such risks to physical safety, one shouldn't use Chinese phones anyway.In China the government forces tech companies to give it backdoors with which to spy on everyone. The police even randomly stop people on the streets to spot-check their phones and force them to install government spyware.They claim, of course, that Chinese phones sold outside China do not have such backdoors/spyware installed. But I don't think any sensible person should trust them. Likewise with any Chinese apps like WeChat -- see this e.g. 2016 Amnesty International privacy report which evaluated 11 companies and scored TenCent (owner of WeChat and QQ) ZERO out of 100."
"But isnt more and more things are being made, bought by the Chinese these days? Even reddit has shares bought by tencent."
"Yea. But a T-shirt is probably not a security risk.Nor is reddit, on which one simply makes not-especially-important posts anonymously (unless your username is your real name and you use the same password that you use everywhere else). Besides Tencent merely made a small relatively small investment in reddit and has no control over it.Your phone though contains all your personal info, contacts, info about your activities, and probably methods for transferring money in and out of your bank accounts."
But a T-shirt is probably not a security riskThat's what you think!!!Does that include stuff like phone apps and such. Is my phone at risk downloading Chinese games like Azur Lane and Girls Frontline?
"Well, to be fair, I should say that it is a case by case thing. Maybe there are some ethical Chinese app companies that you can trust (and which are not forced by the Chinese government to include shady stuff).But in general it would be too difficult to investigate each app case by case. So personally, wherever possible, I avoid any Chinese apps. If there's one that's particularly useful, I try to research a little about it to see the extent to which it is trusted before installing it.Just like if there's a made in Japan or Germany product vs made in China product that are of the same price, one would tend to go for the former.See e.g. this Jan 2019 WSJ report about a Chinese weather app collecting way too much data (stored in China)."
It's the same with their WiFi. Never ever connect to free WiFi in China. People behind the system can see your every move on the phone.

Not to mention whatever they promise to do isn’t that hard to come up with. Browse social media and anyone can come up with promises that can pander to what people want to see.Might help his party better if he comes up with a detailed plan on how these promises will be carried out, and most importantly after implementing these promises, they have good plans to still help the country grow locally and globally."

Hard to be impressed by that when it is still no where near as fast as the Concorde flew 50 years ago. mach 2But I am sure a lot of rich people will enjoy the time savings.
Did the concorde have the same range? I recall On my snes gd aerobiz supersonic it wasn’t that big a range.
"No, certainly not the same range. But it was 50! Years ago. In the 60s and 70s you could fly London to NYC in 3.5 hours. It now takes almost 8.I read some article about why airline travel hasn't become faster, and Infact has actually become slower to save on fuel."
That and also because sonic booms really restrict where you can go supersonic. Maybe it's ideal for SF>Singapore since it's mostly Pacific but many other routes would prohibit supersonic speed anyway.
I’m surprised it have enough fuel for the trip.

Graduating soon from Singapore Polytechnic and currently have a GPA of around 3.3-3.4. I saw the cut off point of the bigger Unis. And i doubt i could make it to those Unis.. Im in the engineering/built environment sector.. My only hope is SUTD or NTU. Even that its very competitive. I hope my Olvl scores could help since I got a 9. But then i heard that Unis will abandon Olvl results altogether.Im quite lost now though I still have 2 years of NS.. Help Anyone?

"Not too sure, my friend had 3.4 eee SP and got in as first choice i believe. Had to wait awhile obviously haha"
Wait awhile?
3.4 can just apply dude. You never know when the cutoffs will drop. All the best
"Why be deterred just because of the cut off point? Coming from the same sector and to have graduated in one of the “bigger unis”, I can share with you that I didn’t make the cut off for A level score and neither did some of my friends who came from the poly route.You never try you never know. Keep applying throughout your NS and try to land yourself an interview. I’ve got friends who only got into the school in year 2 of his NS.Keep your head up!"
i got in NTU at 3.41. i hope you can get it too.
What course are you in? Did you appeal?
What course are you in?
"I got into NTU with 3.4+ so you should just give it a try. If your first attempt didnt work, try again the following year. You got 2 years to think things through."
Engineering course? Was it your first choice?
Yeah. Material engineering. 1st choice
3.4 can try SMU I think. If you got stellar CCA accomplishments they might give you a shot.
Starbucks.
Private unis loh.
Hi is there anyone who has experience here and can tell me abt the bonus? U can pm me about it also. Asking on behalf of a friend!

"Even if you only go by your Chinese name, can you actually fully 'embrace' it in the same way the average person from China or Taiwan does, given the context of how Singapore society functions? Your Chinese name is already hanyupinyin-ized in typical everyday use. I mean, even for the people with only Chinese names, when was the last time you actually wrote your name in Chinese when filling up some form or documentation? Or even in an informal context like marking your personal belongings? I'm guessing more folks would do something like use their initials (in English letters), than Chinese characters. I don't think many really have a strong connection with the Chinese characters that make up their name.At the same time, the goalposts for 'Chineseness' are abstract and ever-changing anyway, so it also shouldn't depend on measuring against the mainland."
It’s what it is. Mainland Chinese use their names in Putonghua now rather than how they’re read in their dialects. Does this make them any less “Chinese”?
Later Chinese people from mainland say Singaporeans of ethnic Chinese descendent can't speak Mandarin or have culture.
"or at the extreme spectrum.. ""Chinese traitors"".kek"
I rather be called chinese traitors than being a vassal state of China.
"I don't use my Chinese name in a public setting because of efficiency, despite having a relatively simple Chinese name.However, that does not in anyway mean I do not appreciate the roots/origins and meanings of those characters. I especially adore knowing that one of the Chinese characters in my name was taken from a list of characters my ancestors established, denoting the generation I am from and that all my relatives in the same generation as myself would share that same single character.I think of it this way. My name is precious to me, and I have great respect for the name granted to me by my ancestors and parents and it is because of this pride in my name that I would much rather use an alias in a public setting than to reveal my ""true"" name and have it mispronounced. It hurts me to see my name butchered (not blaming those who don't speak the language tho, I don't expect others to know the Chinese language, not that prideful)."
How Chinese are we if we don't express our ideas using 中文
chinese programmers should start creating a new programming languages using chinese characters!
Walaneh jialat
"There is one (or more), but even Chinese programmers think it's bullshit, so it's not commonly used at all."
"I find it silly to use names as a measure of ethnic identity. I know a bunch of Taiwanese/Hong Kongers with English names, no one would say they aren't culturally Chinese."
Author: Shaun TanSo much for embracing.
im more concerned about people naming themselves after food items like tofu
Dearth means very little mate
"""A friend who works in an MNC tells me why.""pls tell me the author didn't take so long to even realised that.. have he not even interacts with his non-chinese friends back in secondary school, or even see that some non-chinese teachers have some difficulty pronouncing some chinese names at the first week of school?"
"The name thing, it's not about Chineseness.I don't have an English name/alias because I grew up with my name that was given to me by my parents. I only respond to it and it somehow makes me feel myself.While I can understand why some people decide to have an English name at work, I find it a bit disconcerting.If I can make an effort to know and learn how to pronounce my colleagues name properly, why can't they do it for me?Why is it on me to make my name easier to learn/pronounce?"
"If I can make an effort to know and learn how to pronounce my colleagues name properly, why can't they do it for me?Why is it on me to make my name easier to learn/pronounce?The same could be said for Chinese Singaporeans (regardless of their Chinese or English names) who make no effort to learn Malay, Indian, & other names. For that reason I see this issue as more of chickens coming home to roost than some new problem faced by Chinese people."
"Yeah. Actually most Indians and Malays usually give shorter forms of their names to help Chinese people e.g. ""Just call me Raj"" - the saddest thing is that sometimes they look apologetic about their own names being hard to pronounce for Chinese people."
make an effort to know and learn how to pronounce my colleagues namemust be objectively speaking.
Well I agree but I also try. I may get it wrong the first few times but after that no issues.
"While I can understand why some people decide to have an English name at work, I find it a bit disconcerting.I tend to sympathise unless the joker decides to give him/herself some equally unpronounceable , obscure, or even worse, made up English name. Mmmmm yes, because Bob from Texas over there can't pronounce Xiao Ming but is gonna do better with whatever that jumble of letters is."
"It's not just about making the name easier to learn/pronounce. Some people just do it because they think it's ""cool"" to have an English name. Some people give themselves stupid names, like Lancelot, or Ezekiel, because they think it's ""unique"".I know this because I know Lancelot and Ezekiel, and that's the reason they chose the name as their ""Christian name""."
"To be fair, those are pretty damn Christian names. Like they’re religiously relevant as opposed to just being an unusual English name.It’s more of the names like Jayzne (Jason), Dyonysus (Dionysus, a Greek god), and Jezzika (Jessica) where the names were obviously picked for the sole purposes of “uniqueness” and/or made further convoluted in spelling. And yes I do know people with those names."
So I left a shoebag (with a pair of sports shoes) under the seats in the Circle Line today. It's my only pair of running shoes :(( I was wondering how often others would bring items left behind to the control office and if anyone of yall ever lost an item/got it back please share it here!update: found it!
"Hope you find your shoebag. You can try contacting SMRT/SBS depending on what line you were on. Try to be careful with your items on the MRT, as the police may get involved if someone decided to report a suspicious article."
"Thanks man, going to contact them soon."
Hit that SGSecure
"One of my colleagues left his bag on MRT. He realized only about an hour later after reaching home. He spoke to MRT staff and they got it for him.Just reach out to them. Unless some other passenger took it, they would have it with them."
yep! got it back! thank you :)
How did you get it back?
I contacted the smrt staff and they told me it was at the end of the line. I had to travel across sg to get it back but at least i got it back!
"on a train bound to dhoby ghaut i got off at paya lebar, only realising after i’d left the station that i’d left behind a bag of clothes. went back to the opposite platform and waited for the same train to come back. eventually it did, and my bag was just sitting there untouched.i figure if anybody were to pick up lost items especially clothes or shoes it’d be the staff. i feel most commuters would look at an abandoned article and think nothing of it. but anw congrats on finding your bag lol"
Oh that's smart HAHA unfortunately I had to go to school aka hell. Yep! I think one of the staff found it thank god
It's over a year old lol
Nice! does it fit you? is it your favourite colour?
Your feet must be pretty small then!
It's funny now cause you're having a conversation with deleted posts haha!Actually quite fun to guess what were the contents of the deleted posts
LOL no idea why the dude deleted his comments

"Annual leave, weekly working hours, and cost of living are included in calculating the metric, which isn’t the difference in these variables between men and women. There is a good chance that another study will find that Singapore is the worst place for men to work as well, considering how they conducted the study. This isn’t a study showing that Singapore women have it worst than Singapore men, but rather a comparison on which countries are best for women to work in."
"That's retarded.Also we're the only asian country in the list. Our work culture is definitely not going to be similar to the west so I've no idea why silly things like annual leave are included in a study that's supposed to be about gender equality. This seems like bullcrap.There are some relevant stats I guess, like pay ratio? But even then there was that thing about median pay vs mean pay"
"Because feminism or some shit. Holidays are for the benefit of women, while men are soulless automatons and don't need holidays, so having less annual leave is sexism against women /s."
"Screw this shit la. If you dive deeper will realize there's not much different in paying for the same job, same company and same experience. Only difference being individual's skill in salary negotiation.As a company, the goal is to maximize profit for shareholder. If female are indeed paid lower, why not just hire purely female. Lower cost and maximum profit for the same quality right, instantly please the shareholders Sia.Female save less potentially due to a group of them being housewife or something."
US sjw nonsense lar. They think can stir some lefty powerplay here. Wont work.
"Can’t be, my higher ups and managements are all females. Huh?"
"Yeah this intersectional propaganda is not going to work here.""Men serve NS"" is practically the Exodia card."
"There are already complaints from staunch feminists in Singapore claiming men always bring out NS into debates about gender equality and they feel that it is unjustified.Ask them to serve though and they either talk big, or disappear."
if anything men wasted two and half years of their fing life and society repays them with indifference. Two and half years is a loss of $100k assuming median wage. who compensate us men? talk cock only. make me angry only.
Plus 10 cycle reservice and IPPT. All these western feminism ideals wont float in Singapore one.
"are you sure this is a age for age, same job type comparison. I have a team of both men and women doing roughly the same type of work and i can tell you, they earn almost exactly the same starting pay give or take one to two hundred. And certainly difference is NOT driven by gender. It is driven by prior salary."
"Yeah, lots of ways to skew stats.Not to mention how prevalent NS is in Singapore. Females essentially gets a 2 year headstart."
Again this rubbish
Now tell me why our birth rate is so low.
The 2 years I wasted on NS considered wage gap or not?
Primarily because of NS and the large amount of Singaporeans that the public service hires that practices paying Singapore males more
"Had a female interviewer telling me that they pay males $200-300 more because they ""need to support the family""Had to respond with an awkward smile a la polite cat"
"She's probably mistaken. It's common practice to pay people who've completed NS $200-300 more, and almost all of those are men for obvious reasons.I think the solution to this gender inequality is NS for women."
"It's common practice to pay people who've completed NS $200-300 moreActually it's not common at all, there are rumors (but no confirmed facts) about a few places in the government practicing this, but it's non-existent in the private sector."
"It’s because they take into account of the 2 years national service as work.So hence men get a 2-year increment.Even the 10 years service award, men only got to work 8 years to achieve that because they deduct 2 years of NS."
I was so confused for a minute.... lol I've never heard of such a thing before..
"Well if the cultural norm is an expectation that men pay more to support the family, then it would only be fair that men get paid more since men are also expected to pay more.Try saying in public that the wife should fork out exactly the same amount of money as the husband when it comes to household expenses, see what people say."
A gOod mAn shOUld pAY and pAy! /s
"Women have to give birth too, maternal leave, etc."
Not all women give birth though. And it's always a choice.
"Make women serve NS, then we’ll talk about gender “equality”."
Finland with 161 weeks of combined maternity and parental leave is ridiculous... thats basically 3 full years.
"How did they measure this so called wage gap? Was this the usual median vs median attempt?Did they control for additional hours worked, part time vs full time, personal job choice, dangerous jobs etc."
"Gender already equal la, enough atudies show that maternal leave is cause for pay dips, other things like women not asking for pay raise as much or longer OT's, among other thing, all add up to men earning more because they earned it."
> gender pay gapLmao
Christ not this shit again. Where's Jordan Peterson when you need him.
ok buddy. yeah we definitely need the academic equivalent of a snake oil salesman to somehow pin the blame for social issues on “postmodern neo-marxism” despite the two concepts being almost entirely antithetical to one another.
"“postmodern neo-marxism”Feel free to give it some other name if you wish to play word games, but his arguments are sound."
I would recommend avoiding mention of Peterson seeing as how leftist media has dragged his name in the mud (the hit piece on 'enforced monogamy' linked in this thread for eg). It's a lot easier to convince people by reproducing his arguments
"Yeah they provided links to sites and channels that are openly leftist, who are only going to pull the same ""so you're saying"" nonsense and twist his words."
Just going to leave this here since the esteemed Jordan Peterson's name has come up:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LqZdkkBDas
"I don’t know, for someone who claims that “muh SJWs are regressing society”, he sure likes to subscribe to reactionary viewpoints like enforced monogamy to prevent incels from lashing out."
"He should have just called it SJWism instead of Marxism, but other than that he isn't wrong."
"Singapore militant owned businesses in JB, including massage parlours: SourcesKUALA LUMPUR • A Singaporean man arrested recently for militant activities had multiple businesses in Johor Baru, ranging from massage parlours to restaurants.Sources said the militant, whom Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs identified as Mohamed Kazali Salleh, 48, also brought in scrap cars from Singapore and Indonesia to Malaysia.""The authorities are investigating whether the businesses were a front for the Islamic State terror group,"" said a source, referring to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) by another name.Kazali was among six militants detained by Malaysia's Bukit Aman counter-terrorism police in anti-terror sweeps between Dec 19 and Jan 28.The militant, who had given funds and received orders from Malaysian militant leader Akel Zainal, was told to recruit a few others for an attack on a Freemason building in central Johor Baru, another source said.""He had been in close contact with Akel since 2008.

"So my contracts is up like way Long ago (May 2018) seeing the new plan circle life offered, the $20 for unlimited data ontop of a base plan, any one can tell the procedures of changing to a different telco? I would like to keep my number the same if possible. And existing circle life users any pros and cons you could share?"
"Been with them for a year, summary:The connection is good, like 98% connectivity. Recently there have been a few down times probably due to the fact that they are upgrading their infrastructure/apps.One year with them, so I get a GB free permanent on top of my 6GB plan.I'm running unlimited now because they gave us free for three months last December. When it's due I should be back to my 10GB from various bonuses they gave from time to time.Been paying $28 monthly no hidden feeThey do give 25 free sms now.My calls usage is like +- 20 mins, which is suitable on this telco. Else do find one that offers more call minutes.Incoming call not free, it's using your call minutes.Help desk is responsive and helpful.Company is young and energetic. They give random awards and freebies. Just now a friend got 500MB for his birthday month.Just in: They upgrade most of us to 20GB/mo now for free!"
What’s the 20GB/mo free promo?
"A marketing goodies for existing customers, that many of my friends and me got it, a 20GB/mo add on with no free for three months."
"Still a bit vague.Where did you get it? When? How? Why only 3 months? Is it related to the anger vs ""new customer 20GB code""?"
"a promo code from regular marketing email from themDecember 13, 2018 ""3 months 20GB on us""no ideano idea.Tbh I heck care if new customer getting more than old customer. I already having 9G/mo which is more than enough but it's a good gesture from them, that I didn't ask for ;)"
"Thanks I didn't receive that email sia. but I did some beta shit for them and got about 2 months of free data+new temporary number(that I used for work calls, which is really useful) , so I guess that evens out"
Pro:+1 base plan to rule them all+$20 for unlimited call ( $16 unlimited outgoing amd $4 unlimited incoming)+$20 per month or $3 per days for unlimited data andCon:+M1 network is still subpar compared to other 2 company.+stuipd marketing stinct; their MO is to make people to make noise for them. Damn annoying imo and sometime i just want my telecom to be good boy and just supply me with the service pls.
"Just sign up through online, then there is an option to port your number over. Tick yes.Then once everything settled. Just wait for the simcard to arrive.Don't need to terminate your original line first. Let circles do the porting over. It will auto terminate."
Then the bills of the original telco will discontinue ?
"Yea. When I ported over from Singtel, I didnt do anything about Singtel."
"Fill up the online form on circle life website and choose the port over old number option. You should receive your SIM card as early as the the next day and your number successfully port over by end of the next day. Pros: Good 4G connection. Circle life app is very intuitive, easy to roam overseas with the ability to set limit on data & smses, generous data offering, rewards you with 500mb loyalty program every 6 months. Cons: Experienced a few times of no data connection."
"Been using for a year. Originally some difficulties with a low coverage in a specific work building, but now it’s over. Price is fair, bandwidth is there, and overall no hidden fee or tricky behavior. I stick to it"
"Personally have been using them for a while. Have both their $0/mth as well $28/mth plans (Personal & Work). I agree with most of the points that /u/chaoszcat have raised but would like to also mention that there has been several occasions where it is difficult to get my issues addressed. It is also not as flexible as most have mentioned (perhaps my requests were too much) and have also received somewhat condescending responses (maybe I'm unlucky).My company has CIS with them but I've been with them before I even joined the company, was told that I am unable to transfer to it. If you would like to get free incoming, free 20gb data during this port-in, do PM me for the code. I dont get anything out of it, since my own plan is not on CIS and they refused to move me."
"Liaise with Circle Life before I jumped over. They were pretty helpful. I didn't have any problems with porting over.Only problem is network coverage. I was on M1 previously and I don't think that it is as good as M1. Certain areas, it dropped to 2 - 3 bars.So just bear that in mind :D"
"They will treat you well when you are not a customer. There are many promo codes you can use to sign up.Don't join them if are hoping for some benefits or promo codes after joining. Most of the time, they spam your inbox with advertisements for new joins (you can't use them if you're an existing customer). I don't understand why they keep sending sign-up promos when I am already a member.I don't get any sort of promo codes for existing users."
"Personally i feel that you might want to do more research on other telco first. The unlimited data will throttle your speed(to how low, i not sure) after you hit 20GB. Meanwhile, singtel sim only plan with 30GB data cost around the same with no throttle. Unless you are always streaming video from netflix, if not i see no point in getting unlimited. I barely hit 30GB even as a heavy data user.However, at the end of the day is up to personal preference. Just my 2 cents."
"Am currently in NS, have a mechanical engineering diploma from Singapore Polytechnic but GPA is super low. SIM GE accepts students even if they have low GPAs right?"
Tia gong they only accept students who can do their research themselves.
"Yes, I know of people with gpa below 2 in SIM."
which course & uni (eg rmit/uol etc) are you looking at
"IT related probably, computer coding maybe"
"then should be University of Wollongong, not quite sure if they got requirement on minimum GPA. Either way, i think there's a open house coming up in early march you might want to check it out ?"
I'm currently studying there so you can approach me if you need any advice.
what course are u studying in?
Dss
"Would it be a good course for someone without programming background but not as good at networking? I see dss as most relevant but I don't know if I have the passion.On the other hand, how is the people from poly with exemption blending in? Is there like a stigma about them or is there coping issues?"
"Can be done without programming background, but its alot of hard work. The pace is very fast due to the 2-month term.Easily half the course just copies assignments from their seniors anyway, then study smart for their exams.No stigma, but would not recommend going direct to y3. at least direct to start of y2 or you will suffer."
how do I get exemptions? do I like need an IT diploma from poly?
Depends on relevant mods. Should have exemption page.
Direct to y2? If I qualify for into y2.5? At the point where the course start branching out?
"Y2 is a complete crapshoot because there's some important modules, but the order in which they are offered isn't exactly fixed, so if you qualify into 2.5 Im not sure which you'll end up taking.I'm also not under the new curriculum but I don't really like DSS's new curriculum which seems to be moving towards BIS (imo at least)."
sorry if this is a stupid question but what do u guys study and learn about??
"Basic C++, java, not just coding, but also the planning phase of system development, stuff like that.Havent moved to y3 specialization."
"ah I see, also would like to ask when application for the course is available for DSS? I looked on the website and all I could find were 4 intakes, I assume those are application dates?"
"I cant really remember, there's 4 intakes a year."
Hi co admin =)))
co admwat
May I know how many hours do you go to school for per week? And is there more individual or group work?
"The schedule varies from week to week. No fixed schedule.Plenty of individual work. Some group work, not much. Be mentally prepared for plenty of freeloaders."
"I've checked most of the admission criteria, mostly is C6 and above for O Levels and a diploma awarded by Singapore's relevant polytechnic"
"Was in wollogong. Quite tough if you're not hardworking. Elsewise, with the degree easy to find job anywhere in IT field."
"Which degree did you get? I'm also looking at uow, but can't make up my mind on which course..."
Dss. All the it ones have same year 1 and 2 structure. Just different things during year 3.
"Ah, perfect, dss in my eyes seems the most ""relevant"" to me too. But the other IT courses such as the part time it and business InfoSys, how does it compare to dss?"
"Check the course structure on sim website? You need not necessary go into the field you're studying. Comp sci is quite broad, entry level wise most company will still take you in."
"is the application dates all year round? what if I wanna apply for a spot 1-2 years in advance, after I ORD. Cant tseem to find anything about it on the website"
UOW only offer general degree for distance learning and not Honours degree which need to go to their campus at 4th year. Did you do honours degree.
"Nope. Just the general degree, but there's a graduate with distinction result though. I am pretty sure none of of anyone i knew goes into the honour degree thing."
"Do you think it's worth getting a honour degree? Do you get paid less due to your degree being a general degree? My diploma allows me to exempt for 1.5 years, is the course tough?"
Not too sure but imo still can't compare to local u but at least our benefits are the shorter studying period. Your job experience will be an advantage over local u graduate.
Do you have internship while you studying?
was it easy for u to find a job with the degree from DSS?
Less than a month of job searching. Probably shorter if i tried looking harder? If you try the 2 most common company graduate go to probably quicker.
yeah but the exact GPA requirement is not stated on the site right.. better speak to someone on these concerns. going uni is quite an expensive decision it's better if you are able get the right one :)
Not sure why both u and u/prime5119 were downvoted in this thread.I've tried to restore balance by upvoting.
maybe there are some competitors trying to drag SIM down lmao they are everywhere in term of marketing effort these days.
"just check the admission website. simple thing like this. if they know who you are will happily accept you, more tuition fees to collect."
"Hello /r/singapore. My wife is visiting Singapore the next couple of days and is adamant on bringing back a souvenir. Is there any local brewed/distilled alcoholic beverage that's only available in Singapore (liqueur, whiskey, gin, ...)?"

"Haha. Great beers eh.Oh yes, there is also the long standing Brewerkz."
"There is actually. I know of two, tanglin gin as well as brass lion gin. Iirc, tanglin is the more famous one. Not sure how it taste cause I'm not a gin drinker."
Brass lion is better hands down
"You can try heading to some craft beer bars in Sg to try some local craft brews. I recommend BunkerBunker along Prinsep St, they carry quite a lot of local labels, found it a couple days ago and love the vibes."
You can try to look for bottled Singapore Sling
Upvote for Lion City Meadery.
"OooHave you tried it before?I wanted to buy mead once and couldn't find anything else except Rachelle the Rabbit, so I bought that.Quite nice"

Different income deciles have different tuition spending. Not sure what you're trying to tell by using the median tuition spending across all households.If you're trying to say tuition spending forms a large proportion of the household income for low income households... your graph doesn't show the full picture to arrive at that conclusion.
"I believe OP is trying to show how tuition is much less affordable for lower income groups, and very affordable for higher incomes? Therefore showing how socioeconomic status can potentially affect education prospects."
"Fair enough, but if you use a fixed amount as the reference line across all income deciles... then I'm afraid it still doesn't bring the point across very well.You'll know for sure that $200 forms a larger proportion of household income for the low income families without even using a chart/graph."
"Of course $200 is a greater percentage of a small number than a bigger number. Who is disputing that obvious fact??The point of the graph is to illustrate the degree of the disparity. It shows that $200 is a completely unrealistic number for the poor. It shows how it is impossible for the poor to afford market-rate tuition. They will most likely be able to afford no tuition at all.If your reaction to this graph is ""duh what's the point?"" rather than ""yeah tuition culture is really shitty for the poor"" you might need a bit more empathy."

They will most likely be able to afford no tuition at all.You can replace ""tuition"" with anything under the Sun and you can reach the same conclusion that ""the poor can't afford xxx"". The graph is misleading at best.It did not take into account government transfers and subsidies, it is only income from work and not from all sources. Furthermore, there may be retiree households which have no income but also has no need to spend on tuition. The number of retiree households could be sizeable since Singapore has an aging population.The graph should be made better by showing the amount spent on tuition by income decile, look at income from all sources, including government transfers, and also only among households with at least 1 child of schooling age (households would have no need to spend on tuition if they do not have a schooling child)."

"I'm horrible at stats but if median gross monthly income in sg is almost $4400 as reported in dec 2018, how is this graph accurate with 7th Decile (household income not individual) under $4000? isn't 50th percentile the median (yes i had to google)?"
"I don't know where you got $4,400, but it's possible that refers to total household income. The graph's y-axis denotes household income from each member of the household."
"no. it's as i stated."" The median gross monthly income among Singaporeans and permanent residents who were employed full-time was S$4,437 this year, including employer contributions to the Central Provident Fund.""graph is per household member, which doesn't help much if it's a 3 gen household. If we want to be accurate, Y axis should be per household with at least 1 child of school going age.For households with at least one working person, the median household income for Singaporeans is at $9,293The median household income from work per household member, however, is at $2,792.This graph doesnt give conclusive proof by the fact that those at the higher percentile could have less kids, less # of household members and thus lower expenditure on tuition. There are many single adults earning $12k+ plus who live on their own ( ""A single person occupying a dwelling by himself is also considered a household."" )You can be sure nominal sum spent on tuition per household per kid is many times higher for those with higher disposable income. Also from personal experience on the lower end tend to be less willing to spend on education etc.Just remembered why I hate stats....so easy to manipulate.I appreciate the point OP is trying to make, just interested from a statistical point the income figures this govt provides."
"Elderly cardboard collector in S’pore contracts arthritis, unable to support intellectually disabled sonA vegetarian food stall in Shenton Way that offers low-cost meals to the needy has appealed to the public for help.AdvertisementIf the name of the food stall sounds familiar, it might be because you’ve previously heard of them here:Selling cardboard for 0.05cents per kgIn a Facebook post on Feb. 15, eatery Yummy Mummy wrote a lengthy Facebook post about an elderly cardboard collector in Singapore.Addressing her as Mdm Neo, Yummy Mummy reveals that the woman makes a living by selling cardboard for S$0.05 per kg.Neo tries to sell at least 60kg of cardboard a day in order to get by, reportedly only on a packet of rice and some bread.She [Neo] skips her breakfast and if she has rice for lunch, dinner will be BREAD.

"Honestly, cases like these are why I support the idea of a UBI."
personally id rather aim towards universal healthcare so people can strive towards their goals without unforeseen health issues pull the rug under them
Yup. This is a much more feasible and practical idea.People who blindly support the idea of a basic income don't realize the fiscal difficulties in implementing one.
Healthcare is undoubtedly a need and a right.But food and shelter aren't?A UBI is simply an extension of those necessitites for life.
"But food and shelter aren't?There are already government programmes for that. Why would you need to implement a costlier and more complicated ""solution"" when you can just work to improve current ones?There are too many ignorant people who think of UBI as a panacea to all of our society's issues. Fact is Singapore is doing a decent job when it comes to welfare for the poor, there are some that fall through the cracks yes, but more can and should be done to improve the current programmes rather than try to implement a costlier and more complicated fools plan."
"No one is claiming that UBI is a panacea.What we are highlighting is the difficulty of obtaining access to help due to bureaucracy.Take the above for example, it required the attention of a mainstream newspaper before MSF was able to intervene - I'm not saying that they did it for good publicity, but the poor in society are not necessarily the most visible.They might not know where to seek help or feel too proud/hesitant to ask for handouts.Access is important; and a UBI is a good way to overcome barriers to gaining said access."
"The onus should be on the needy to approach the relevant agencies for help.If they do not know how or where to, that's something agencies in Singapore should improve on, spreading awareness and educating the needy on the help they can get. If they're too proud or whatever, that's honestly their own issue.UBI isn't going to be any different from any government schemes that help the needy right now. Not to mention, it's literally just an inflated ""government angpao"" that people who are eligible already get now.Frankly speaking, from reading the general comments about people wanting UBI in in this thread, it's clear that they haven't really thought it through or even compared it to how welfare in other countries work other than the idea that ""helping the poor is good, they need money, therefore UBI is good"".Not to mention, the very funding of it is going to be an even more complicated matter. Like I said to someone else, it's not simply ""raising taxes on the rich"" to fund it."
"I think we fundamentally view society's and an individual's responsibilities differently. I believe that society has a duty to its citizens, perhaps a parent-child relationship to some extent. I disagree that we leave needy people alone because ""it's their issue if they're too proud to seek help"" (paraphrased).We need to understand that humans are emotional creatures who cannot be expected to act rationally and objectively all the time. Why someone who is in need refuses help deserves research, and we should not be too quick to brush aside their concerns about losing dignity by seeking assistance - because for some, they might feel that dignity is the last thing they possess.Discussions about UBI are necessary because we need to ask ourselves the hard questions behind the casual assumptions we make about society today. Such as how capital has far outstripped labour in terms of income generation; or how we can formulate better (re)distributive models that not only address the objective measures but also subjective perception.Humans are diverse in opinion and desires, and any endeavour involving them is necessarily complex. That should not be an excuse for not attempting to implement welfare schemes. Many changes are a matter of political will, but some are not, and it seems ironic that we, as fellow citizens, sometimes sabotage discourse on making equitable changes because of our own preconceived notions."
"How do you propose to fund a UBI without a drastic increase in taxation though? Wouldn't it be more sensible for aid to be targeted at those who need it the most (like this guy here), rather than disbursed shotgun style to everyone?"
Marginal tax rate? Above certain threshold increase even higher tax rate. Tax the rich even more. Their 10% increase in tax probably worth 100% of others.
"UBI is very expensive, because it entails distributing a living income to every single member of the population, regardless of their social circumstances or income (yes, even to the residents of Sixth Avenue GCBs). You're looking at a massive increase in taxes to fund it, close to say Norway or Denmark."
"How about a modified model based on income? Surely it’s not a one size fit all, maybe a more customized / specific version that would be more suitable for SG?Just because the generic model doesn’t fit / work in SG, is not a good enough reason to completely discard the option.How about priorities from bottom up with more help to the bottom by taxing more on the rich, reduce income / wealth inequality."
"The fundamental idea of UBI is that everybody, regardless of income or wealth, receives the exact same basic income. If you're going to vary the money disbursed based on the income or wealth of the recipient, then it isn't significantly different from what is already done in most countries (including Singapore), where the poor receive some financial support funded by tax paid by their richer countrymen."
"I don't believe that singaporeans generally require a UBI. However, I do believe that the government should give more welfare to the poor.. Especially the elderly poor, since they are the ones that built Singapore up."
The Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation packages are timed right before a general election for the very purpose of recognizing the elderly who built Singapore with their own hands.
"Yeah what I'm saying is, these packages may be sufficient for the majority of the elderly population, but it still fails to sufficiently provide for the more at-risk cases."
"Then it's not UBI, it's welfare. The whole point of UBI is that it is need blind, which reduces admin costs massively and increases buy in from the general population."
I don’t think the answer is a binary of choosing either UBI or welfare model. The approach should be to balance the pros and cons of the options available.
"The whole cost saving portion of a UBI is that it replaces welfare. If you try and have both you lose a ton of cost savings since you need to start evaluating need for the other stuff. In that case, you may as well just have welfare.That really is the big advantage of UBI, no need to do any means checks, just send a cheque (haha) to everyone registered every month. Minimal administrative costs."
"How about send a cheque to everyone below certain pci? But if give too much, no incentive to work harder"
That's not a universal basic income anymore then. That's just government subsidies/handouts... something Singapore already provides.
"The idea of expanded welfare (more than what is done currently) is to provide more help to those at the bottom. The incentive (ubi / welfare) should cater just enough for the bottom but not too much that they are not willing to work. The issue is in balancing the amount to push people to continue working up.I don’t think the answer is a binary of choosing either UBI or welfare model. The approach should be to balance the pros and cons of the options available.SG should continue update / refine / evaluate the various possible options. A trial can also be done to gather more data (sometime in theory it doesn’t work, but reality + unforeseen factors can help it to be successful)"
"I don't think anyone would disagree that the idea of doing more to help the poor is a good one. Any child could say the same thing. The problems and fiscal complications arise when it comes to financing such programs.It's really, really not as simple as ""raising taxes for the rich"". We're not in the same situation as the USA for example, where raising certain taxes would be slightly beneficial."
"You can’t do too much to ensure they are still incentivize to work. Therefore the amount is not as much to finance. The welfare model is looking to improve but not to be relied upon. For productivity, it’s important their wage / income is not too much that they would work lesser.The welfare is a safety net and a new model is to increase the safety net to help the needy. To finance, improving factors such as efficiency can also help to reduce the tax needed to be raised.Throwing money at a problem which would require higher tax to finance is inefficient. Therefore people should be looking at efficiency / effective more than financial aspects(worrying about tax). SG gov, single power structure is also a positive factor unlike in US where a lot of money is spend inefficiently for politics which could be used to help others."
No link bro. I'm talking about financing the UBI programme.
"Except you’re not really distributing anything to those living in GCBs if you just tax back the UBI you give to rich people with progressive income tax in the very same year.I’m not seeing how this is different, mathematically, from giving money directly only to the poor, except that welfare framed as a universal benefit tend to more politically resilient in the long term."
"Perhaps I am misunderstanding what you are driving at, but if we are going to distribute money to the middle class and above only to increase taxes imposed on them so that their taxes paid to the government will effectively include what they received in UBI it strikes me as rather ridiculous. You might as well just limit the ""income"" disbursed by the government to those people who genuinely need it then, rather than have this merry-go-round of cash.Could you care to explain why UBI is more politically resilient? If I see my taxpayer money going to people who are far richer than me I'm far less likely to be pleased with the system than if the money actually went to people who genuinely needs it."
"You ask how it makes sense to give money to people who pay it back in tax. One reason is that by giving everyone the same amount you drastically reduce administrative costs as well as fraud. Variable payout systems are gamed by the pseudo-poor, which leads to costly enforcement systems. Giving everyone the same is simpler, saving costs.Singapore already has one of the world's simplest and easiest personal taxation systems, and arguably UBI is the simplest financial welfare system."
"I agree UBI has its pros, but in my view its best suited for a system where such a large proportion of the population is receiving government welfare that spending huge sums to distinguish who is or is not eligible to receive welfare and preventing people from gaming the system is no longer practical. This is fortunately not the case in Singapore, since a far smaller proportion of the population is dependent on welfare, so its cheaper to just directly provide them the funds in a targeted manner.I can see UBI working only in a much-transformed, post automation economy, where a substantial amount of jobs at every level of society has been rendered obsolete due to AI, and the tax burden lies dominantly on the companies which employ the AI to generate profit rather than on income tax. CMV maybe?"
"Historically, the experience in the US has been that universal benefits such Medicare are much more difficult to repeal by republican administrations compared to welfare policies targeted at the poor, the hypothesis is that people suffer from loss aversion; they care psychologically much more about “losing” a benefit than whatever gains from lower taxes may result from cutting universal benefits (even though mathematically, they’re equally losing out in terms of paying more taxes) and the larger part of the electorate this affects, the more resilient the welfare policy becomes."
"I don't think political resiliency of a welfare system is usually an problem, unless you have a political party dedicated to gutting the welfare system (which seems to be an uniquely American issue)."
Wouldn't the tax income from the rich more than offset the amount they receive from a UBI?
"The thing about increasing taxes for the rich is that these rich people have the means and ability to immigrate out of Singapore once they deem they are paying too much taxes. A big reason why Singapore has so many millionaires and billionaires is because of Singapore’s low tax rate. Take that away, and u will see these people moving out of Singapore. In the long run, I’m not sure if u will collect more tax revenue to fund UBI through increasing tax."
"Surely we’re not even close to that equilibrium. Maybe increase to a higher amount but below the alternatives?There are limited amount of countries where the rich would be willing to live and that is where lies SG competition on tax. As long it’s below the others, SG can charge higher than what it is now.Surely no rich want to migrate over to developing nation simple due to tax. Their choices are limited as such. SG should not fear the rich moving away too much. Giving the rich such power is dangerous as they will have SG as hostage over money, “do as I say / want or I’ll take my money and leave”. SG would be prioritizing money over values (whoring itself out in fear of losing sugar daddy)"
"Actually, France had done this before. They raised taxes on the rich and the rich decided to leave en masse. Gerard Deperdieu ended up taking Russian citizenship. So much so that France's tax revenue fell after the tax rates were increased on the rich. Truth be told though that France raised the tax rates to 75% which is probably higher than what you had in mind. But if you want to support UBI, then tax rates would have to be increased by a significant amount.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/31/france-drops-75percent-supertax"
"In long run France probably benefit more out of this. It’s not healthy or sustainable to over rely on the super rich tax. Also, they have legal / accounting teams to help them in loopholes, both for their company and personal tax.Despite a fall in tax revenue, a fairer tax system to ensure everyone pulls their weight is better. Imagine how screwed it is that a nation have constantly placate to the rich as they get to threaten you everyday over money while contributing to the wealth inequality.Don’t think generic ubi model would work - historically it didn’t anyway. Maybe the answer lies in individual country implementation to suits their need and capability. The model should inspirit / bore welfare and safety net to the less fortunate and not to live in fear of the wealthy.Imagine if 1 day the rich decide they are unhappy with some of the programs, since most of the money is from them, they can direct or influence the new programs and of which will be beneficial to them. Possibly creating a cycle in ensuring the poor will remain poor - they have the power of the market to suppress your income. Over relying on the rich is dangerous and unsustainable in long run, any fall in tax revenue is more of correction than a loss (don’t let them use scare tactic to get their way)"
"I understand the premise of a fairer taxation policy. But the objective of raising the taxes for the rich is to increase tax revenue without having to increase the burden of taxation on the poor. If the revenue from taxes drops because of a policy you implemented, wouldn't it be a policy failure? A fall in tax revenue would mean that benefits (that are largely offered to the poor or the otherwise less fortunate) is reduced."
"Issue is (at least for other countries) the rich as individuals and companies have legal / finance teams helping them with loopholes. Which leave the poor with working wage that is insufficient to live off. The idea of expanded welfare is to cater just enough for the bottom but not too much that they are not incentivize to work. The issue is balance how much to push people to continue work and move up.It takes more than just the short term changes to effectively measure a policy. Any extreme change or fall will definitely be an issue but a slight dip in short run can be what is needed for sustainability. The notion of ever increasing revenue is unsustainable. Also, more money does not mean more to the needy people. Having less just mean you need to be more efficient, throwing money at a problem does not solve the issue.Also, if the rich are to be over relied, the gov will then be serving them ahead of the people in fear of monetary loss. This can escalate quickly to corporation / rich individual possibly installing power to create laws that benefit them more than the average people. US have lobbies / “super pac” conundrum."
"Unfortunately I am not really well versed in other countries taxation rates to comment. What you say makes economic sense, but honestly I will imagine you will need to increase the tax by a huge amount to fund UBI, though I’m not sure how much."
"Yeah don’t think a generic UBI is the answer. Historically it didn’t work as the giving living wage does not incentivize people to work.SG should continue update / refine / evaluate possible options. A trial can also be done to gather more data (sometime in theory it does not work, but reality + unforeseen factors can help it to be successful)But the most important is the spirit of such movement should be to help the needy / incentive people to move up and not to be enslaved by the rich who is currently benefiting from the current model that resulted in such vast wealth inequality.Keep in mind that the rich have vested interest in keeping things the way it is now and can afford to hire mouthpiece academia / politician to advocate their goal. (Let’s give in to their demand as the alternative is they run away with their money, which mean gov does not serve the people but the money)"
"Yes, we need more rich people that don’t start companies (tsk tsk, FB Co-Founder). Even if that requires the poor to suffer even more. Right, right? /s"
"I'm sorry, how exactly do rich people make the poor suffer? And are you saying that rich people only benefit a country when they start companies?"
"As much as you don’t like it, these people pay tax and probably more tax than you and I pay. The tax revenue is precisely what allows the government to set up programmes and initiatives to help poor people."
"sorry, what's a UBI?"
Universal basic income
why not just good social care?
"Sure. The reality is that there simply are people with permanent physical or mental disabilities that make it hard or impossible for them to find employment. Whatever we want to call it, I would 100% support any initiative to ensure that these people can afford to have a decent quality of life (i.e. accommodation, hygiene, food, healthcare and even some degree of recreation)."
me too :)
NIT w/ LVT is better
"This is insane. Why would anyone do this job though? I'm not sure if I'm reading the numbers correctly. 0.05c per kg of cardboard x 60kg per day is a salary of $3 per day. Why doesn't she just get a McDonald's job? That would earn her more money in a single hour. Don't mean to be insensitive but the numbers seem completely off.But yeah if I hear one more Minister say that it's the duty of charity organisations to step up to help people like this and not the government, I'm going to have a fit. It's the government's duty to tax people and figure this shit out.Her house looks like it could do with Marie Kondo's help too."
"hi ive been involved in a (really new) outreach programme that specifically aims to help elderly cardboard collectors so i thought i could give some insightthe reason why most of them do this job is because they dont have the qualifications needed even for a simple “mcdonalds job”, a number of them dropped out in primary school so they don’t even have pri school certification.many of them also have health issues that’s why they’re unable to work their previous (definitely more lucrative) jobs! at least for collecting cardboard it’s own time own target.there’s actually a lot of help that can be given to these seniors however the majority of them i’ve encountered don’t want/ is reluctant to receive the help because they like the “independence” that having a job and supporting themselves gives them. when you’re poor and have very little, the least you can hold on to is your dignity right?a lot of them also may have had negative experiences with “government” related stuff in the past so for this group they tend to avoid anything that comes from the government, even financial assistance.you must realise that these seniors are generally very hardy and resilient people. that’s why in the past it’s been difficult to give help because (for a significant portion of them) they themselves refuse the help. however from what i know, since 2017 there’s been more specific help geared towards this group of elderlies!"
"I've done some work with elderly through charitable groups and as you've said, you do meet such individuals.There's a fictional description that struck me as painfully true about such individuals.Cockbill Street was where people lived who were worse than poor, because they didn’t know how poor they were. If you asked them they would probably say something like ‘mustn’t grumble’ or ‘there’s far worse off than us’ or ‘we’ve always kept uz heads above water and we don’t owe nobody nowt.’He could hear his granny speaking. ‘No one’s too poor to buy soap.’ Of course, many people were. But in Cockbill Street they bought soap just the same. The table might not have any food on it but by gods, it was well scrubbed. That was Cockbill Street, where what you mainly ate was your pride.Terry Prachett, ""Feet of Clay"".I'm really glad to hear about your programme! Thanks for sharing. :)"
"Add in the Vimes ""Boots"" Theory of Economic Injustice and you've got a pretty accurate look at how the poor remain poor."
Sir Terry Pratchett was always so good at distilling moral and intellectual issues into very simple to understand concepts (and in a satirical and humorous way too). Thanks for quoting that.
"But surely you must agree that it is preferable for people to make independent efforts to improve their own lives and support their loved ones, rather than just resign themselves to fate and become dependent on government / charity support?"
"This is an amazing piece of insight, thanks for posting! Does your volunteer group facilitate their cardboard collecting efforts in any way then?"
"welcome!! uhh the purpose of the outreach is to mainly build rapport with them because as i’ve mentioned above a lot of them can be quite resistant to assistance. after the rapport is built, they’re more likely to share what are some areas that they need help in and that’s where we’ll engage the help of FSCs, SSOs etc. and then follow up with them.there’s a lot of engagement with the middle men (aka cardboard buyers that the elderly sell their cardboard to) because they’re the ones that see the elderlies everyday and are the “closest” to them. the middle men are used as a platform to inform the seniors about when we’ll be coming down for free dinner etc. and also to let us know if any of the seniors are more absent than usual so we can find out if they need help."
"i think that the case with many of these elderly is that they were not fortunate enough to even receive the education that would have granted them the ability to deduce that what they're doing is inefficient. at the same time, many of them are too headstrong and stubborn to accept help and advice from strangers. it ends up creating this vicious cycle where we see 70 year olds continue to resort to selling paper, collecting cans and cardboard to scrape by"
"Ministers say that because they don’t want the government(which is using taxpayers money collected by law) to pay for them at a rate that is politically unfeasible.It’s not the government fault if ppl are the ones unwilling to foot the bill for social expenditure. Which is why they often bring up charities because ppl who genuinely want to help them can do so using these avenues, with no political cost as the government is not forcing anyone to donate money, unlike taxes."
"From the article, it seems like she's receiving $150 worth of vouchers from the government every month and MSF is already reaching out to provide more help. I'm pretty sure they will at least help ensure they get food and find suitable employment.Sometimes people fall through the gap nobody knows how bad it is."
If the grandma cannot speak English she cannot even get a McD job. Those that work in the kitchen are usually younger so they can work fast.
"According to a minister, it is so they can exercise."
"Well right now I think she won't have to worry for the rest of her life, donations will start to pour in.Good for her"

Wait till you learn that we’re the largest hub of human trafficking in SEA lol
Wait what!?
Yup we sort of are
"Keyword: ""Hub"".Being a place with high transit traffic does that to us, both for the naturally higher traffic jacking up the numbers (and makes it harder to scrutinize said traffic), and the fact SG connects to a lot of the places people are transiting to legally... and not knowing the shit that will happen once they reach wherever they're going..."
sin is where the money is
"Profiting off human misery, and not stepping up enforcement to international norms so long as it remains plausibly deniable and revenue-positive.GE coming up, folks."
"Yes, and no. Not slavery like you’re thinking of, but the conditions in which many foreign workers, both domestic and construction, live in are appalling.I’m not sure likening that to slavery is the best, most accurate comparison, but they do face terrible treatment in their living conditions and work, and we don’t recognise it even."
"Yeah the dormitories they live in are so dirty. And those are not cheap even. MOM does conduct surprise visits to ensure that they are in livable conditions, but their standards a bit low IMO."
"And so is NS, which is literally forced labour, but the article deliberately excludes it for political purposes."
RIP Israel then.
"RIP South Korea, Israel, Taiwan, Vietnam, France, Brazil, Thailand, Norway, Sweden."
"More than that actually. Include finland and switzerland as well. But norway and sweden dont really count because it's easy to get out of it. Regardless, it's common for government and govt-linked organisations to create loopholes for themselves, because those who write the rules will always make double standards for themselves."
"Eh I did mention calling it slavery doesn’t feel quite right.On the other hand they really do have no recourse - that doesn’t penalise them very heavily - if they get a shit employer or face shit luck.Your gauge is Indo and maybe Filipino, fair enough. But what about the village Burmese, Cambodian, Thai etc, tricked into signing a contract after being over-promised earnings and not told about loans and expenses? Or the Bangladeshi and Indian workers, brought here after selling all their assets to pay recruitment agents for the privilege of risking injury to earn, what, 1k per month?Again, not saying that calling it slavery is most accurate, just saying they have shit conditions and don’t completely fall under Willing Buyer Willing Seller as well."
"Its defined as modern slavery, as these individuals do earn a basic salary but it is too low to pay off the debt they owe to the agents, causing them to be in debt indefinitely.Also some foreign workers are lied to by the agents, and end up working at places totally different from their job description."
"Yeah I’m not arguing that some of them work in modern slavery - I’m not sure categorically saying all foreign domestic and labour workers work in modern slavery, extrapolating from a number of them that do, is the most accurate.Also only a Sith deals in absolutes and you basically hurt general public buy in when absolutes are used."
"Of course not, not all domestic workers and foreign workers are in modern slavery!"
"It's not even 1k per month though, not after you factor in that many workers have to pay kickbacks to an agent to get their job. It's an illegal practice that's been going forever, btw.Meanwhile, it's not uncommon to hear of injured workers not being given the appropriate number of MC days. The whole WICA process for them is also left to the mercy of their employers, because unethical ones can certainly make it needlessly complicated.As mentioned, accommodation is another area that's lacking. The newer ones are rather decent, but many don't get lucky and still have to live in squalid conditions, notably factory converted dormitories. If you've seen the state of FCDs, you seriously question why the MOM even approves them.Then there's nutrition. For workers who aren't allowed to cook and have to rely on catering, their food gets prepared early in the morning (think 3am) and they then eat it for breakfast/lunch. Would you eat food that's been left at room temp for 8 hours? I wouldn't.So while the workers may have smiles on their days off, the way we treat the people who build up our country is extremely inadequate."
Kickbacks? You can check with foreign workers and the NGOs that work with them. It's pretty common knowledge that many pay thousands just to get a job in Singapore.http://twc2.org.sg/?s=kickback
"1k is a generous assumption. Most of them earn maybe 6,7 hundred, before employers deduct food and lodging cost. PLUS they sold everything at home and possibly took loans to come work here, they’re starting from zero or negative assets.Look, my essential message is that they are not yet slaves. NOT YET. But their lives come uncomfortably close to being slavery. We won’t treat other Singaporeans like that, why do we treat foreign workers so badly?"
I agree action is better than talk; I’m just pointing out the logic behind labeling their employment slavery has (some) merits.
They look happy because they get to live like the rest of humanity for a day
"I don't really think that (modern) slaves have to be miserable all the time. If we applied your logic to NSFs then just because we see NSFs being happy at Orchard Road, then they should all be relatively okay with conscription.I think there's plenty of very... slave-esque practices involving foreign workers. I was quite shocked to find out that my relatives keeps the passport of their domestic helper."
"yea whats wrong with conscription? same logic with paying taxI have no idea where you are heading with this comparison. I'm just pointing out the obvious folly of saying ""look there are happy NSFs/domestic workers over there, they must therefore love conscription/working as a domestic worker"".in indo many family also have their domestic helper stay in. theres no such thing as time off on weekend.This would probably fit the definition of modern slavery too. Just because it's happening in Indo as well does not negate the fact that it's happening in Singapore.u should try to talk sense with ur relativesOf course I have. The practice though appears to be common, despite the fact that MOM explicitly highlights that it is illegal. Which also makes me doubt if this issue is actively being enforced."
"if u ask majority those workers whether they feel they are slaves they probly wont,This seems... really speculative. And it also assumes that you can actually get a clear answer from people who don't want to be penalized for speaking their mind.and i believe most have better living condition here than in their home country.Like I also said earlier, that conditions might be worse elsewhere does not negate the problems in Singapore right now.to the point that they will likely be sad if they cant work here anymore cos we decide that it is slaveryEr you are really jumping the gun on possible solutions here. Sure we could ban domestic workers entirely and shut down the industry, but then we can also have better regulations and protections for domestic workers so that their employment is not longer under slave-like conditions.also seems like we in the privileged position start telling that this is slavery based on our own standard of living and utopian ideal of what constitute a slavery. again not saying there are real slaves eg those who got conned, kidnapped etc, trapped here for the rest of their life doing slave work and cant simply quitThe report is based on some fairly objective criteria. This paragraph is also self-contradictory. If you can acknowledged that people who get conned/kidnapped/trapped here are indeed operating under slave-like conditions, then what if if you ask these people and they say that they are fine and that their home countries are worse. Does this, using your own logic, solve the kidnapping? Are concepts like getting kidnapped coming from a privileged position?also no point of having this slavery index and stuff. its like we r in a room with stinking trash and instead of taking the trash out, we r making research on how stinky it is and start complaining that it should not be thereI think understanding and recognizing the problem is obviously the first step towards a solution. If you are in a room with stinking trash and the pretend that the trash is not there or insist that people cannot say that the trash is there and how much trash there is, then I have no idea how you will arrive a common understanding to begin to address the trash problem. People will simply operate under half-solutions (since there is no full acknowledgement of the issue), or worse, people can just pretend that the trash is simply not there.In any event you are also making a false dichotomy - we can have these studies that help us better understand the extent of the problem and at the same time also have NGO and Government legislation to assist these foreign workers. It's not as if we all can only do one thing at a time."
"They really ought to be more specific in detailing exactly which groups they are referring to within the context of Singapore, rather than just using the term ""modern slaves"" which seems to be very broad and sensationalist. There is a difference between poor working conditions for labourers, specific cases of FDW abuse and sex trafficking rings for instance. The index isn't really clear on exactly who the 19,000 ""slaves"" are.Certaintly there is some incidence of abuse of vulnerable groups but the term slavery is going too far. When most people think of slavery they think of:Slaves being subject to the absolute authority of theirs owners.Slaves having no legal recourse.Unregulated working conditions.Slaves having no choice.I don't think this squares with the treatment of groups the report is presumably trying to draw attention to, which might make most people critical of the findings and do more harm than good. Most, for example, would not find it believable that we are doing worse than Vietnam and Indonesia in combating ""modern slavery"". While there are problems here, they really shouldn't be compared to the situation in places like NK and Africa."
"The methodology is in the website. I'm not saying I agree with the methodology, but it is there.The 19K ""modern slaves"" definition is there as well."
I can believe this. Seen too many domestic workers in horrible working conditions.
"I don't know how to react.Hmmm? Acknowledging that we're not as clean and/or great is a good step, and then work to make Singapore a better place in whatever capacity you can is the next."
'member that couple who made their maid drink mop water?That counts as a type of modern slavery.
"That seriously pales in comparison to...In the context of this report, modern slavery covers a set of specific legal concepts including forced labour, debt bondage, forced marriage, slavery and slavery-like practices, and human trafficking.source: the report’s methodology... these two. These right here.For example, when a maid doesn't want to quit because she hadn't paid her ""introduction fee"" in full (for 6+ months).Or when people from poorer countries transit through Changi Airport on their way towards outright hostile working conditions (not necessary within our borders... most of the time...)"
NS ah?
"The data on this website is unreliable. Apparently only 15,000 in the U.A.E. If find this hard to believe."
How do you know its unreliable?
"I am somewhat in agreement.Domestic workers and foreign blue collars laborers are especially at risk.Many either have no easy access to assistance, or are kept in the dark about their rights.And even when they have access to help, laws vastly favoring their employers can be used to force their compliance."
"Surprised to learn this, but not really shocked. The world that we live in today is more ironic and hypocritical than ever.A first world country does not equate to paradise because not everyone living in it gets to enjoy everything it has to offer."
"You mean you had no idea? What do you call the foreign workers and foreign domestic workers who have little rights, little pay and little recourse when injustice is done? Slaves isn't far off."
"You weren’t born knowing shit either, and we need allies. Chill on the aggro unless they fight back."
Not unfair. Apologies for the tone.
But was it really you?
DIO?!
"It is no secret that singapore is a great place for human trafficking. According to their methodology,In the context of this report, modern slavery covers a set of specific legal concepts including forced labour, debt bondage, forced marriage, slavery and slavery-like practices, and human trafficking.It is quite clear we check 3 out of the 5 boxes.2. many people from our third world regional partners often borrow money to move to singapore/get contracts in singapore.3. til today i see that the practice of dowry and purchasing foreign bribes is still a prevalent thing in singapore5. we are human trafficking hub.but of course the report doesnt take into account that 2 and 3 are literally our neighbours desperately trying to flee their country. (and us accepting them with open arms)"

Actually open them, and you'll see mostly zeroes and minus-one ratings (on a scale that goes from -1 to 1).

Pretty cool. Is it open to public?
"It can be booked via SLA website for events and photoshoots. They make you fill in a couple of application forms to determine who will be there and what it will be utilized for.. Option is for two hours free, but media can't be for commercial use, or pay a fee (around $200?) for the whole day and to be able to use the media for commercial gain. Source: booked it for a pre-wedding photoshoot. Another LPT: SLA has quite a number of abandoned sites which it manages and let's people use in this way. Check their youtube channel for some sample sites."
ah i see. good to know
"Just checked out their Youtube, what an interesting channel! Thanks for the rec."
"Damn it would make for a good movie setting, like a 60’s spy agent base."
So its not really abandoned
"""abandoned"""
"thanks man, been wanting to use such spaces!"
i heard u have to pay. im not entirely sure. this pic was taken an hour before an event that was being held there
the event was quite a while ago ;)
the mclaren event? yeah it was that lol
Reminds me of the building from The Office.
Welcome to Slough
Isn't this where zombipura was filmed?
never heard of that movie (sorry) but did a quick search and yeah it was filmed there
there was a day it was open to public and y’all could walk inside https://i.imgur.com/CvMitO1.jpg
Looks like it could host an art space. Something like the Tate Modern.
the interior is really nice too
I love this architectural style. I think it's called International Style.
I don't think it's International Style - International Style is something more like MBFC. This looks like something in between Brutalist and Bauhaus.
Ah yeah that's probably a better match. The entrance threw me off a bit.
Where is it located?
to the left of labrador park mrt. one of the factories near the sea
I can see this building from my office / gym and I stare at it while on the treadmill.
Somebody call Dan Bell

"Is it really that hard to plan ahead? I've been out of my home country about a dozen times and so long as there isn't a natural catastrophe, serious illness or injury, etc. it's not too hard to plan things going smoothly. There are also tons of resources online for first-time travellers who aren't sure what they're getting into, not to mention the travel sections of most bookstores/libraries..."
I'll be quite sympathetic if she was just complaining about the difficulty of traveling aboard - we all have a first time disaster. But its her 'advice' in her last paragraph that makes me undecided whether to laugh or to cry.
"I can sort of understand...(?) for Japan at least.Like, personally, I'm an on-time kinda guy, especially for things I care about. And I'd definitely be caring about holiday plans because I paid for it and I wanna enjoy it to the fullest.Then on the other hand, my parents (who went with me) are more relaxed. They said ""Aiya, on holiday already still so rush for what? Holiday is to relax what, dunnid to rush here rush there.""Thankfully we weren't the only family on that trip (we were tagging along with a section of another family's tour of Japan) and I could small-guilt trip them into rushing because we're not the only ones affected if we're late, it's not good to trouble others.But yea, back to the point: Some people wanna relax during holidays, and to them, relaxing means no rushing or targets to meet."
"Hmm but Japan is one of the easiest non-English speaking countries to travel to. They have a reasonably well-developed and reliable public transport network that makes it easy to get from place to place, most urban places have English directions and service staff conversant in English or Chinese, the prices there are quite reasonable for first world country standards, and you're far less likely to be a victim of crime or scams as compared to other countries (in which other country will the service staff chase after you to return extra change you left behind?).But yea, back to the point: Some people wanna relax during holidays, and to them, relaxing means no rushing or targets to meet.To each their own I guess. I've been to Japan enough times that I can afford to take it chill since I've been to most of the attractions already, whereas in Europe I take a more target-driven approach because I'm far less likely to make a return trip.But if your travel style differs so much from your parents, perhaps it may not be the best idea to travel with them that much. I know you want to be a filial son / daughter and bring your parents aboard, but I think this kind of differences lead to tensions I prefer to avoid while on holiday."
The biggest problem when travelling is not the country you are in but the people who you are with. 5/7 would travel alone again.
"it's not too hard to plan things going smoothly.If it's just by yourself, or another person. The larger the group gets, the steeper the difficulty curve. There's too many moving parts, too many variables. Friends and I often plan trips together, and friction happens one way or the other. We've learned that it's part of the process.She's only 19, just starting to adult. Everything is hard."
"If her answer to meeting difficulties is simply never to try again, things will remain hard for her even when she's 99"
Precisely this. It doesn’t help that her difficulties stem from something pretty easy to solve – punctuality.
"Exactly. I find it hard to emphatise with her finding it challenging to be on time. Makes her sound like the kind of friend who is late for every meet up and texts you 10 minutes before the arranged time saying, sorry traffic is bad or whatever lousy excuse."

"Just shows how sheltered the youth in Singapore can be. In a country where living with your parents into adulthood is the norm, there's little incentive for the average youth to become independent."
"""don't go on a grad trip because you might need life skills to survive"""
"The worst part of this wasn't the fact that she lamented issues with trip planning, missing transportation or learning that dealing with people can be difficult.It is that she concluded the experience was not worthwhile and ultimately decided that the lessons learnt had little value.That's just really sad. Sometimes we need to get out of our comfort zone in order to know what we have, where our limits lie, and when we should turn back.I hope she changes her mind in the future."
the part about bus leaving on time for me cracking. such a blondie
"All who wander are not lost...But lost she is, yes?"
Very lost. No google maps to save her either.
"Wat is dis.People learn by making mistakes. Of course things will cock up when you go on trips for the first time.When you are 40, will you be the only one in your circle who refuses to go overseas because you are scared of missing a bus."
Ya and then blame everyone for not jio-ing her
"If planning a trip to Japan is hard, then she gonna get a ride shock when she come enter the working world..."
First world problems 😑
More entitlement than first world.
"The sad part about this is that singaporeans will predictably go ape shit and pontificate/project all sorts of issues on to this, at the girl's expense.She's a young person saying something stupid. Young people say stupid stuff all the time. Why are we all so surprised now."
Yea people who use Audrey as an example of why girls should be enlisted clearly haven't seen some of the numbskulls that remain just as blur and sheltered even after completing NS
To be fair no one is digging into her personal information. Everyone is just attacking what she said.
Yeah so we're attacking something stupid that was said by a 19 year old.
Yes like how Gen x complained about millennials zomgz we are getting old
"I think she is conflating two ideasPlanning an overseas trip by herselfPlanning an overseas trip for entitled Singaporeans who don't really want to go on holiday with an open mind to experience culture, but wants to enjoy specific experiences overseasIf I plan a trip for myself it will be done pretty quickly. I love experiencing and learning new things in new countries, so a lot of things will be on the list, and being familiar with using public transport I won't have many issuesBut if you have to plan for a group of people with specific tastes and interests, who are interested not in learning something new, but rather only doing specific things (ie visiting more ""civilised"" places in less developed countries) it will be a headache to accommodate everyone's tastes"
But unless you're traveling alone wouldn't you have to plan around your companions' interests anyway (unless they are the bochap type who will enjoy anything you lead them to)?Somehow or another I can't see her as the sort who enjoy solo traveling.
She doesn't seem like the type of person that enjoys travelling from this short post. Literally nothing about any enjoyments from the trip. Or maybe she expected holidays to be like relax trips to batam
Ok this is awfully embarrassing but does anyone know how to edit the title of the post?

Missing 5:01pm bus isn't an excuse for non early riser
Unpopular opinion here.She is just this young and probably cant adapt or refuse to adapt to her surrondings. Probably she will learn along the way on how many things she will miss out and hopefully that will change her form of perspective and learn to do backup plans.
"another illustrious product of the education system.""bus that comes at 5:01pm is gone by 5.02pm being just a minute late"".Madam, you were late."
So much facepalm. xD I hope she learns the skills to tackle similar situations in the future.
Send her to Tekong. She will learn about time management and more.
That's kinda untrue lollll my platoon can be punished for 3 weeks consecutive for not fall in on time at 5:30am but you still can see some people slowly go wash up in PT kit at 5:25am then act like they are rushing down at 5:40am I'm like WHICH PART OF THE PUNISHMENT YOU CANT GET ENOUGH

Grabhitch should take punitive measures against riders who cancel last minute. Like erm....driver can be half way there and the rider cancels just like that. Grab's matching isn't that great sometimes and so drivers may need to go slightly out of their way to get to the pickup point.The above example is bad but still not as bad. The ultimate crappy rider is the one who wants to cancel but refuses to do so and do not pick up calls. Poor driver has to wait there wondering if the rider will come.Grab should really charge these people a cancellation fee. Want to save costs by getting hitch but act as if they are the only ones whose time is important.
space gray or silver for macbook pro... (taking obvious scratches and discolouration into consideration)

How long is too long to message someone again whom you're not very close to but got along quite if you just want to catch up as friends? Like an ex colleague/army friend/school friend that you don't keep in contact with. Does it become weirder if their of the opposite gender even if you have no intents other than to catch up as friends?
No leh. I usually jio my old friends casually to have lunch together albeit last time I talked to them was primary school
not old friend but more like old acquaintance
Trying to catch up always makes me feel like they need me for smth either help with this or that or to promote something to me
Never too long; have met up with people I haven't seen in ten years.
"Yes but I hope you still jio though. Nth to lose but I think she will appreciate it if you make it clear that you don't have an ulterior motive. If you didn't, then try to make it clear like ""hey, I am an IT staff now, what have you been up to?"" something along the line. Go for it!!"

you can try just telling the front counter u have 11b? they should be able to check on their system.anyway for polyclinic u dont have to pay right away
So I can just skip payment and pay it with 11b next time? If that's the case thank you!
Polyclinics have your records in their system. Just bring some card to scan your NRIC at the registration counter. They will know that u are in ns.

"i think you’ll need to tell them when you register at the counter. just info ive read arnd here btw, i dont have an 11b. best to have someone else confirm!"
"damn, listen to the Bernie Sanders' I'm Running For President speech.and then realise that a lot of these problems are already solved in Singapore."
The world runs in circles. The US is basically repeating their mistakes from the past while we’re still solving our first batch.
What are those problems.
is MDIS or Kaplan better for diploma programs?
If you study private diploma then you have to study private degree.
"Neither, even if you can’t enter local polytechnics studying O levels again as a private is a far better investment of your time and money :x"
poly drop out here haha
Oh man.. there’s no way to go back?
"not sure, did apply through DAE tho, guess we'll know if I'm in when the school term starts..."
SP/NP/NYP/TP heh
why not RP :(
which diploma and are you planning to do a bachelor's after your diploma
"if you're going for a levels next year, means starting jc this year, follow the US primary race. it will open you to debates in public policy, social policy, government, current affairs and all that. it's a great time to write a GP essay in my opinion"
I'll keep that in mind!!Im not into politics but with gp starting guess I'll have to
"Anyone knows any places where I could buy an ad that I am looking for participants for my thesis project? I am trying to write up my thesis but I am not sitting in Singapore right now, and it is really hard to find volunteers without being at NUS."
have you tried reaching out to sgvolunteer.com? My club used it once to source for volunteers for our event and it got good responses. Worth a shot.
"Oh, a great idea for our research group in SG in general!"
"Carouhell, Gumtree"
"Awesome, posted on Carousell! Gumtree posted before."
"Is there a group of software developers/programmers who meet up semi-frequently or something? Would like to join to exchange experiences and getting to know new people, too."
Have you looked up Meetup.com? Tons of software developer groups for a huge range of languages or specialties.
"I'm aware of the place, but looking for other sources I might have missed out."
Let me introduce you to https://engineers.sg/events/Take your pick of meetups!
"Woah, thanks a bunch!"
"Swee, got reply ask me go for interview liao :):)"
Thanks boys and girls i shll do my best :D
"Year4?? Same here, just keep spamming them applications!"
All the best!
Good luck and all the best!
Good luck and be prepared!
Anyone here worked on a documentary before?
What’s up
I'm thinking of making a documentary and am curious about the process haha
"Well, all I can say is that it's fun! It's a lot like doing a thesis but more fun, really. I mean, the need for research should be pretty obvious. You can have a 'topic' in mind but you'll definitely do a lot of research before settling on an objective. One thing I really enjoy while doing a documentary is the interview process. I love talking to people and hearing their take/experience on the subject we're working on. Bringing them together later on will be a chore, but discovering different perspectives from so many sources tends to bring out some hidden gems so... I think it's quite a journey. I hope you enjoy it too!"
Wow! Thank you for all the valuable information. I appreciate it :)
You’re welcome. Enjoy!
How can I help?
Just curious about the whole process. Was thinking of making one haha
Interesting :) I would love to help if you're gonna do it. It usually starts with a ton of research and then selecting some interesting specifics to document. What topic do you have in mind?
Cool! I'll PM you
Anticipating :)
"Went back to nus to climb aaaand nope, I’m sick. Must’ve drank too much Milo, heh.On a side note: vanilla flavoured milk and fresh milk are not the same. Interesting thing I didn’t notice for a long, long time."
My cat went missing yesterday :( he was staying with my brother at Sumang Lane. He's a grey Ragamuffin with a twitching eye and blue collar.
Oh no! I hope you find your cat soon.
I hope so too! :(
"Have you posted on local FB cat communities? I'm only on Cat Lovers Singapore and can't name other groups but give that a go. One piece of advice I've heard before is leaving his litter box outside so he may smell it and make his way back. Seeing as he is a Ragamuffin someone might have kept him, though. I've only ever had dogs go missing, so I pasted posters along all the bus stops on roads that link to my place and offered reward money (the people who found my dogs refused the reward though). Good luck finding him!"
"I have yet to post on local FB cat communities, my SIL informed her estate group and they said they'll keep a lookout for him. I'll try the litter box tip. Yeah I think someone might have kept him as well but I hope they inform us if they do intend to keep him, at least we know he is safe. I posted on all my social media and got friends to repost it. Thanks, I hope we can find him."
The fb groups usually take awhile to add new members so start applying to join now! I think if anyone found him they won’t be telling you that they are gonna keep him (also I would wanna beat the shit out of them if they openly admitting to basically catnapping my cat). I understand there’s a shred of hope there though. Did it have your details on its collar? I really hope you get reunited with your cat. I have three and honestly think I wouldn’t be able to sleep or eat if any of them ran away :(
"Yes I applied, waiting for them to approve D; true, I don't think they'll tell too and yeah I would be upset that they catnapped him but if he chooses to be with them then I can't do much D; there are no details on his collar, just a regular collar with a bell. I'm afraid that even if no one took him, there are wild boars around the area, what if he got attacked D; I hope to find him soon too ;( it's kinda like losing your child D;"
"Yes I know how you feel, my cats are my fur children.. I don’t want any human kids ever so they have filled that spot for me! When I lost my dogs I sat on my balcony and cried like hell. It took me two weeks for the people who found and took them in to contact me. I don’t think wild boars will want to attack him unless he wanders too close to them or is trying to steal their food. I used to have wild boars behind my house, they seem to mind their own business. Definitely try to post leaflets to your brother’s neighbours and pasting posters up! Try looking into the drain areas too, a friend of mine lost her cat and eventually found it in a drain outside. Sending good vibes your way, all the best!"
"I'm glad you found your dog again :( I totally understand how sad you must have felt. Yes, a friend of mine is helping me make posters and I'm gonna go look around the area later during the day. My cat normally doesn't eat anything other than his cat food so I hope he doesn't get into trouble or anything D; thanks for the help and good vibes. Really need it ;.;"
"I was so happy this afternoon and now I am very sad!! I feel despair and my heart physically aches. For no reason at all. :-))) why am I like this :"")))"
"don't blame yourself beaver, we all have good times and bad times :( I hope you find the reason soon, do you notice anything that triggers it? eg weather, environment etc"
It's just at night when I'm not occupied with work then I feel horrible :-(
stupid late night thoughts :(
"Hmm, do you feel this coming and going? Are you female, if so it may be hormonal. If it is kind of doing it in cycles, it may be a sign of bipolar II. Just a speculation though. Take care."
I'm a guy tho haha
"Do you believe in the theory that every time something good happens, something bad will balance it out?If so it’s likely your brain conditioning itself and anticipating negativity of sorts. It’s largely placebo. Maybe try to shift your mindset instead. But otherwise it sounds so much like an anxiety Attack."
found out okto is closing down and merging with channel 5... das sad :((
will miss kidscentral
they should bring back kids central :(
"Hi,Wanna ask if anyone has had similar issues as me and if so how did you solve it?The story is: I got accepted into NTU, accepted the course through Joint Admissions and now they have emailed me to say that as I had not responded online after emailing me twice, my place in NTU is revoked. Unfortunately, I had not received any emails from them since I accepted it and believe this is a misunderstanding.Appreciate anyone who can give guidance on this. Thanks!"
"If you accepted through joint admission, why would they even email you afterwards. Sounds fishy"
yea all my friends received like admission emails for matriculation too so im not sure whats going on.. tmr call them
"See what evidence you have. From what i know, most online acceptance will auto send emails to acknowledge that they received. Check the email you put during the application whether if you have it. If so, forward to them and call them to tell them you have sent them the acknowledgement."
I didnt receive any email of such an acknowledgement but I have a screenshot of the page at confirmation.
What did they say when you send them the screenshot
"They only sent email to inform me today, replied them today but no screenshot, waiting for their reply first bah"
ye man im just asking for info cos the hotlines are only from 8.45-5.30 bro dont worry will call tmr
do you think they will entertain you if you dont show them the proof...?
You got check your junk/spam folder?
yea man
Today on Darnest things my pseudoscientific colleague says: The moon appears yellow because of water vapour.
Your colleague doesn't know what he is talking about.The moon looks yellow because it is actually a hole in the sky. Everybody knows that.
Eh pls. Is because it is reflecting the yellow sun
"Man, I don't know how you keep a straight face when talking to them. xD"
My eyes have rolled so far back my head I can’t bring them back around anymore. Help.
tell him it’s because of the cheese laah
"This would be the natural conclusion of the decision obtained by Jolovan Wham, stating that stern warnings are purely administrative and have no real legal effect."
"Past warning has no impact on sentencing: High CourtUnlike a prior conviction, a conditional stern warning cannot be factored in during sentencing for other offences, the High Court has clarified in a case involving a former undergraduate who molested his classmate and peeped at another student.The 26-year-old had touched his 24-year-old classmate while she was asleep in April 2017.This happened just two months after he was administered a conditional stern warning by the police for peeping into a bathroom cubicle at a 22-year-old undergraduate in November 2015. Both offences occurred on campus and all names were redacted in judgment grounds delivered last week.Under the terms of the warning he received, the man was to ensure he did not commit any offence within 12 months of the warning being administered. But he did.As a result, he was charged in court for the peeping offence as well as for the molestation offence.When it came to sentencing him for the molestation offence, the district court took as aggravating factor the fact that he was serving a conditional stern warning for peeping.In the judgment grounds, Justice See Kee Oon said the peeping offence cannot be taken as an antecedent as the man was ""not charged, much less convicted and sentenced"" for it until he was also charged for the outraging modesty offence.Justice See Kee Oon noted that the man had ""an extremely strong propensity for reform"" but pointed out that ""deterrence outweighs rehabilitation in this case"". The former student, who has started serving his prison term, had his sentence changed on appeal to eight months' jail with no caning, and a fine of $2,000.He said the warnings are a signal that reoffending will lead to the accused person being prosecuted for the offence he had been warned for, and not as ""discrete aggravating factors in sentencing"".The former student had pleaded guilty and was convicted in a district court last year for the peeping offence, for which he was sentenced to one month's jail. For the second offence, he received eight months' jail and three strokes of the cane. A third charge of criminal trespass was taken into consideration.In the High Court appeal last month, the man's lawyer Tan Hee Joek had argued his sentences were manifestly excessive. Among other things, he said the district judge had erred in treating as an aggravating factor the fact that the man had reoffended while serving the 12-month conditional stern warning.Mr Tan also called for caning to be set aside as precedents show caning is not always imposed even where private parts are touched.Deputy Public Prosecutor Raja Mohan said the district judge had rightly considered that the appellant had reoffended two months after being given the warning, and had escalated from peeping to committing molestation.Justice See partly allowed the man's appeal for the peeping and molestation offences.He saw no reason to disturb the eight-month jail term for the molestation conviction, saying the aggravating factor of escalation in criminal behaviour was negated by the mitigating factor of early plea of guilt.But he set aside caning, noting there was no skin-to-skin contact or prolonged contact in the molestation case. The victim was also not restrained by the man.As for the peeping offence, Justice See said it was not premeditated and the offender was ""suddenly overcome by an inexplicable urge to peep"". The judge held that the threshold for a jail term for peeping was therefore not crossed and replaced the one-month jail sentence with a $2,000 fine.He noted that the man had ""an extremely strong propensity for reform"" but pointed out that ""deterrence outweighs rehabilitation in this case"".The former student, who has started serving his prison term, had his sentence changed on appeal to eight months' jail with no caning, and a fine of $2,000.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"
"I understand there is a r/SGExams forum thread and I did ask there before but only 1 person replied..but I would really like to get a broader perspectives on what kind of CCA I should choose.So basically I'm interested in this 2 CCA's mainly: Interact Club and ODACInteract Club basically is a club where students get to plan activities which would then be held at charity organizations or other beneficaries as a volunteer work. (i.e: Touch Home Care, IMH, etc) I personally enjoy more of the planning but wouldn't really mind doing some good deed whilst presumably being able to build my portfolio? (As per what seniors used to say)Then there is ODAC, which basiccaly stands for Outdoor Activities. Its literally like a UG but without drills and uniform. So there is planning of camps, Physical Training, teamwork,etc.⚠️I'm really into both so I don't really have a problem joining either one. Since I'm okay with both then I'm thinking next would be, which one would benefit me the most in terms of applying for anything in the future that will help me stand out and why.If there is anyone who has experience in any of this or have interviewed people for anything, which one would help me to stand out more in my portfolio?Thank you!!"
"(Controversial?) Opinion here : Just join what you like.Portfolio this, portfolio that.Unless you're an elite student aiming for really good scholarship programmes or anything similar, it doesn't even matter.Hell, unless you're the chairman or head of the CCA, it doesn't really matter portfolio-wise what CCA you joined - unless its competitive sports and you're really good at it."
ahh icic. okay ty!!
"I’ll be the cliche one and say do what you enjoy.I was in a similar situation years back and I chose the sports option. Did I regret? Nope. If given a chance would I have went for the other option? Why not? At the end of the day you meet people, make friends, create memories/ experiences, and that’s what it all mattered in my opinion.If you’re thinking ahead for portfolio, I have a friend who has an amazing portfolio that dates all the way back to secondary school days, I also have a friend who had literally empty portfolio. Both of them, like me, just graduated a year plus back and they are both doing very well in life.What I am trying to say is that you really don’t have to be too stressed about it at this stage of your life. Enjoy your JC days and focus on your A levels.If you’re interested, I wanted to go into a team sport in my JC days but got rejected. I then chose an individual sport and was blessed to have made many memories (good and bad). I then chose to go into a team sport in NUS and had the time of my life. My first job did not care about any of these experiences, while my second job probably hired me because of these experiences.Good luck lad!"
Ahh icic! Thanks for sharing. Really appreciate it!!
Talk to people from those CCA in your school. They will have a much better idea of what it's like for your school than anyone on reddit. Both will have good impact on your portfolio as long as you get a leadership role in it.
"ahh icic. so as long as i get a leadership role, im good?"
"Yes, the point of portfolio is to show your non-academia qualities. If you show active participation in many activities, it'll do the job. But portfolio is mainly just for scholarship applications and overseas uni so don't worry too much."
ahh icic. i plan to sign up for a scholarshop in the future thats why
"Are you a top student (academically)?Are you aiming to apply for a scholarship?If not...At the JC level, only your results count. Even if you're trying to be a doctor or dentist, only the results count. CCA is a distant second factor. I've seen national players with poor results, chairpersons of Student Council with poor results etc. They all could NOT get to NUS via the discretionary application.My suggestion is to take the CCA that requires less time AND use the free time to study.Source: I used to be in the education system. Not going to elaborate."
"haha jc just started...and if top means being the highest scorer, im no where near top ... maybe average?I plan to apply for a scholarship tho.okay. ty!! i'll take your advice into consideration too :))"
Top means straight As :)Scholarships tend to value community service more than CCA or leadership.You can volunteer after your A levels are over (before enlisting into NS if you're a male citizen). That buys you more street cred than any CCA.
Oh really? Thats news to me. I didn't know scholarshop values community services more! Will you be able to tell me more please!!
"CCA records count for very little in everything except maybe scholarships. In a job interview setting, CCAs are basically what you talk about as chit chat before or after the actual interview, which is going to focus on your actual qualifications.Maybe scholarships, esp government ones, might care a bit more since the G likes to pretend that they are promoting ""well rounded"" students.Anyway as for your choices, ODAC imo. You can always do things similar to interact after school. ODAC on the other hand is quite difficult to find the time and people for."
"ahh icic. yea, i plan to apply for a scholarship. ill take ur opinion into consideration. ty!!"
"I think if you’re into that kind of work, join the Interact Club. Personally I think it’s a good way of learning some planning and execution skills, and to gain perspective on life. Could be vital during your formative years.But ultimately you have to have some sort of interest in the role."
"What about ODAC, in your opinion?"
I don't think employers really look at CCA. Just do what you enjoy. More importantly are your grades.
Okay. Thank You!!
"Interact Club - you can meet many people (and new people who came to join 1 or 2 CIP events), and get to organise community events (good for CV). CIP CCAs is always a good idea."
CV as in portfolio?ahh icic. I was thinking about that too 😖 cant really make a decision between ODAC and Interact Club.ODAC allows for more leadership experimentation and usage from what my seniors said.
"If you're aiming for NUS/NTU/SMU, they won't care about your portfolio unless you're applying through discretionary admission or certain courses like medicine. If you do what you enjoy, you'll do better at it and the interviewers will be able to see that you are genuinely interested."
ahh icic. passion will show right. HAHA tyty!!
"Chances are you won't get to show your passion at all.Application is done online where you just pick the courses now, I heard there's no need to even key in your results because they (local uni) have it from MOE, assuming you're from A Levels.It's literally bot-sorted.Unless you go to the appeal stages, no room for sob stories (and inspirational stories) at all."
"Eh, CCA as a distinguishing factor is way overemphasised. People in council, people in any fancy sounding club are really a dime a dozen. Think about it, grown ups in the real world don't care how snazzy your CCA sounds because to them they're all the same - clubs that kids go to play in after school. In the grand scheme of things your JC CCA won't affect your future that much.JC sucks enough with A levels, pick the club that sparks the most joy and you can see yourself spending your precious non-mugging time in :) if not for my CCA I would have gone bonkers!"
ahh icic. May I ask what CCA were you in?
Drama club :)
ahh icic HAHAH.
"I would say, if possible, sign up for both. Manage the time somehow. If your experience is anything like mine, after JC and maybe early uni you may never be free enough to try so many different activities again."
Ahh ic. Any reason/benefit for signing up for both?
"I was a JC student 2 years ago and I studied humanities, graduated with 85RP. This might run a little long but I’ll share my personal experience here. Your CCA doesn’t matter much unless you’re in student council. When I was applying for Uni, nobody asked about my CCA. Initially, I took up a sports CCA because I wanted a contrast from the constant studying, but the constant trainings quickly tired me out and it wasn’t helping me academically. I switched over to Debate club, and I think it was the best decision I made. My schools debate club taught me to think critically, question sources and formulate strong arguments by finding flaws in my own logic. It helped me anticipate criticism and preparation for it through creating counter arguments and exploring new methods of supporting my stand. What I learned in debate club played a big role in me getting 85RP. Formulating a stand and convincing arguments are critical in humanities subjects, and I felt that the lessons taught in subject classes on essay writing were lacking. Every essay I churned out conformed to the same structure that every other student was using, my essays were generic and uninspired. It felt like I was just filling in the gaps between topic sentences and paragraphs. Debate club taught me to deviate from the norm and explore new styles, and even using philosophy to argue certain points. Within a few weeks of joining the club I went from dreading the long essay writings to looking forward to them. Once you break out from the same “format”, you can get creative and even find it enjoyable to write. Essentially what I’m trying to say is, based off my personal experiences, if you want a CCA that helps you grow academically and intellectually, go for debate. However, if you’re a science student you may feel differently about the emphasis on essay writing.On a side note I’ve found that majority of the people in debate were legit scholars with 4H2s and they really pressured me into sitting down and studying.. so I guess it’s good for positive influence too. Of course this will vary depending on your school"
HAHAHA icic. Thank you for the advice!! Really appreciate it.
Interact club so you got more time to study.
HAHAHA okay. ty!!

"Mindef launches recruitment hunt for cyber security specialists, sets up new cyber training schoolSINGAPORE - The Ministry of Defence (Mindef) is on a recruitment hunt for cyber security specialists whose mission will be to beef up its cyber defences.It has also set up a new cyber training school that will conduct courses for such specialised personnel and also help improve cyber hygiene for servicemen and employees across the ministry and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).In a statement on Wednesday (Feb 20), Mindef said it hopes to recruit some 300 personnel to perform specialised operational roles in areas such as cyber incident response, monitoring of computer networks, and testing for security weaknesses in IT infrastructure and applications.The announcements were made on the sidelines of an Advisory Council on Community Relations in Defence (Accord) visit to Stagmont Camp, hosted by Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How.Mr Heng told reporters after the visit that the establishment of these schemes and the cyber defence school will put Singapore in a better position to defend itself against cyber threats.""(Why we've set up these capabilities is) to ensure that we are operationally ready even in the face of these attacks, so that we can protect our sovereignty and give peace of mind to Singaporeans,"" he said.These regular personnel, who will be on the front lines of Mindef and SAF systems to protect against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, will come under two schemes.Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How (left) speaking at the Cyber Defence Test and Evaluation Centre. ST PHOTO: KHALID BABAThese are: the Command, Control, Communications and Computers Expert (C4X) vocation under the military experts scheme, and the Defence Cyber Expert (DCX) job specialisation for defence executive officers.The introduction of the new schemes means that there are now specialised roles in cyber defence for uniformed and non-uniformed regular personnel, as well as for national servicemen.In February last year, Mindef introduced a scheme for full-time national servicemen (NSF) cyber specialists, where they will take classes under the Singapore Institute of Technology's cyber-security degree, while being deployed in advanced cyber-defence roles.The C4X scheme will be implemented in the middle of this year, while the DCX scheme started late last year.Related Story Digital Defence to be sixth Total Defence pillar, signalling importance of cyber securityRelated Story 30 per cent of total spending set aside for defence, security and diplomacy effortsThe SAF Cyber Defence School, which was established last November and opened on Wednesday by Chief C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence) Ng Chad-Son, has run courses such as the Cyber Defence Operator and Cyber Specialist Cadet courses, meant for NSFs in the cyber vocation.The school will also conduct cyber security workshops for servicemen and employees of Mindef and the SAF to strengthen education on cyber standards, regulations and best practices, and to inculcate strong cyber awareness.Depending on their operational roles, DCX and C4X personnel will be trained in technical skills such as threat hunting, malware forensics, cryptography, network security and cyber analytics.Besides operational roles, these regular servicemen can also be deployed to staff appointments like operations planning, policy formulation and long-term capability development, said Mindef.The apex appointment under the C4X scheme is a Military Expert 8-ranked commander (Brigadier-General equivalent), and Defence Cyber Chief for the DCX scheme.Some of the qualifications required to apply for these schemes include information technology and computing-related academic qualifications, strong analytical abilities, and certifications in the cyber security field.C4X personnel will specialise in military cyber operations and have deep understanding of military systems and networks, said Mindef. They will also, through various military courses, attain leadership skills and military knowledge.Military Expert 4 S. Subash, 30, a plans officer under SAF C4 Command who has signed up to be a C4X, said he will have to take a number of external courses as part of his transition process.""This is to ensure that we keep up with evolving technologies and to be updated with the cyber threats out there,"" he said.Defence Cyber Expert Serena Ong, 31, said she took on the job because it was challenging and there was a lot of room for professional growth, with cyber threats growing and evolving all the time.Her job includes scanning for cyber threats on the Web, and collecting information on them to analyse how they may affect Mindef's systems.""The DCX scheme is good because now there's a shortage of cyber security professionals not just in Singapore but around the world. This scheme will help to widen the pool of candidates,"" she said.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

Abit late to be building your barracks when the zerglings already in your command posts.
Too little to late I suppose.
Great Grandfather ran to the jungle to escape.
Heard from my mum that her father did so too. He doesn't speak about it to any of his grandchildren.
"My grandfather walked all the way to Thailand. I think that's why he knows Malay and Thai. His sister died along the way. There were dead bodies along the roadside. He ate tree bark to survive. One time, some Japanese soldiers were chasing after the group. A Malay family hid him in their latrine. When he returned back to Singapore, they were building the war memorial. He wanted to buy a spot for his father but it was too expensive for them to afford. Only the rich and well-connected are on our war memorial. The poor die nameless at the roadside. He hates the Japanese and questioned my mum on why she went to Japan for a company trip. To this day, he doesn't like to eat a lot and gives his wife and children all the food. He's a very skinny man and the rest of his family is plump. He still worries whether they have food to eat."
would love to hear more of your grandfather story.
"We can forgive, but never forget."
""
so sorry to hear that :(
Can’t imagine being forced to be a collaborator. They hold your fam hostage and the only way out to wear that black hood and occasionally finger other ppl as resistance members and send them to their deaths.From a purely ethical standpoint what’s the right thing to do? It’s a trolley problem.
"At that point, fuck ethics, survival first."
"While I may not necessarily agree with you, I respect your decision. Because what's morality if you're just a dead corpse? Survive, and your children live to see the future."
"I think a lot of people, if put in that position would have the same reaction. When push comes to shove, human survival instincts can be quite incredible. We just don’t use them much because of civilisation."
The many outweigh the few.
"My grandpa (back then a young boy) tried to climb up on a waiting truck filled with Chinese men. He thought they were off for work and wanted to earn a little something to feed our family. Luckily a Jap soldier spotted him, pulled him off and let him go. But not before beating the crap out of him.My other great grand uncles weren't so lucky. It was a hard time for all."
"I wonder why they pulled him off as if there was some sort of morality left. I recall listening to a podcast talking about accounts of Japanese soldiers talking about their killing experiences. At the start of the war, some of them were fresh and unwilling to get blooded because most of them are teenagers or professionals in one field or another. But the war changed them as it went on, they didn't feel a thing from stabbing or shooting at men to women to children, old and young to toddlers. Their actions and what they saw from their fellow soldiers desensitised them. Maybe that soldier that pulled your grandpa off was simply following orders to have only adult Chinese men on the truck."
"Who knows? My family is just really thankful that he did so.Actually on my in laws' side, there are a few stories of mercy by some Jap soldiers. My spouse's grandpa was a young boy, and a small group of Jap soldiers would give him treats and even food at times. In turn, he would run small errands for them. I think they even gave him ciggies which he sold for cash. He stole from them once though, and I think he got a thrashing when he was caught.I think war brings out the best and worst in people. Maybe the soldiers were reminded of their own brothers or sons at home. I read somewhere that the soldiers had to undergo camps in which they were brainwashed. Some kamikaze pilots were even chained to their cockpits.What I dislike the most is how the Jap govt refuses to admit the war even occurred. At the Tokyo museum, there is no mention at all of their invasion of SEA. There is mention of how the Americans bombed them, and that was how WW2 was summed up."
The japanese school at changi does acknowledge the atrocities and they fold paper cranes for one of the war memorials. Or at least thats what i remembered during my ne tours
"IKR, considering how advanced their technology is, you would think that they would be able to openly recognise the events too."
"It's the same as the line of thought that the majority of Germans during Nazi Germany don't actually subscribe to the Nazi ideas, but were in it simply because it was their country. Wehrmacht soldiers were just ordinary soldiers told to fight the enemy. In the military, 'just following orders' is a good way to stay alive and unnoticed."
"I think in a situation as shitty as perpetuated war and occupation (imagine as a NSman you've been deployed for half a year overseas; how shitty is that?) you do what you have to do to survive lah. And sometimes things like just ""following orders"" and the killings that come with it gets rationalized as being just another day on the job.But of course there are moments where the reality of the situation cuts through the haze of bullshit and you have stories of Japanese soldiers pulling people away from the Sook Ching massacre spots."
"The massacre began in Singapore, where somewhere between 5,000. Japanese estimates, and 100,000, Singaporean estimates, ethnic Chinese civilians were killed at various places in the region. The operation was overseen by the Kempeitai and subsequently extended to include the Chinese population in Malaya. The majority of Singaporean Chinese were Hokkien(Picture: Singaporean-Chinese heads on poles in Singapore by Leo Rawlings)"

Grandpa had a shop in Arab street area and hid people sometimes in the back
"My grandfather went up the lorry, thought he could help his family was the eldest - his younger brother tried to talk him out if it but to no avail. His brother lived to a ripe old age with great grand kids."
"wait sorry I don't understand. So your grandfather stayed in the lorry. Assuming he didn't live, how are you here?? Am I missing something?"
"maybe his grandfather already had kids before going up the lorry? :( sook ching didnt discriminate by age, young or old, up the lorry you went if they caught you :("
"Yes, he was in his early thirties and had 6 kids. The extended family was staying together. Was a volunteer in the local arms force. He went up and never came back, rumour has it they took him to Tanah Merah / Changi beach. What I gathered was that the Japanese targeted those educated people or those who might put up a resistance."
"What I gathered was that the Japanese targeted those educated people or those who might put up a resistance.That is correct. The Japanese put out word that those who boarded the trucks would have work to do - thus earning a salary. Those whom wore glasses were targeted, as that was a sign of education. Checkpoints were set up where males chinese had to write their names - those whom could write were also hauled up to the trucks.Those whom looked able-bodied were hauled up as well."
"My grandfather knew better than to even appear for the screening.After all if you had join the Dalforce, you knew what the operation was about anyway."
My grandfather hid in a drain by a temple. Those were dark days

Great gramps sold tau suan. Japs loved it lol
"Thanks for posting this. I grew up as an expat in Singapore, 1979-88, and I remember learning about all this in 4th or 5th grade. Took field trips out to Alexandra Hospital, mass graves, etc. Seeing this brings back my memories of Singapore."
"Grandpa was a nurse working for the british when war came. Didnt have it easy. Got shot in the leg and walked with a limp for the rest of his life, also witnessed some of his colleagues getting tortured by the japs.Only realised later on that he was most probably present at the alexandra hospital massacre and lucky to be alive. Never liked to talk about his experiences though."
"You know what, this made me realize the shit my grandparents go through.They were there when Singapore was still under British rule. Personally has seen Singapore at war. Saw the horrible acts done by the Japanese. And also their surrender.They were also there when Singapore joined Malaysia and separated shortly after. It must be a time of great uncertainty because no one believed Singapore would survive. They had to choose if they saw a future in Singapore and believe that becoming a Singapore Citizen was a right choice.But let's not forget that they managed to experience something lucky, a Golden Singapore Age.They saw PM Lee Kuan Yew and the first generation of leaders built up Singapore. Saw that the country was prospering and thriving. GDP was increasing, quality of life was improving, etcThey really have gone through a lot. We must be extremely lucky to still have some of these people alive with us today."
My grandad was out doing a delivery when they rounded up the Chinese men in his village. He also fast hand fast leg married my grandma for fear that she would be rounded up by the Japanese for forced prostitution.
is your grandad a non-chinese?
"He was Chinese. We have a 2 character surname, 歐陽 (Ouyang) . With his given name it makes it 4 Chinese characters. The Japanese didn't like it as most Japanese names were 4 kanji characters. So he changed it to just 歐 (Ou)"
"This was either in my textbook, notes or exam paper cause I remember seeing this a while back."
Reminds me of mediaeval torture methods– can't believe this was less than 100 years ago
Cue the LKY story
"A young LKY himself was once rounded up by the Japanese along with other Chinese men. Sensing that something fishy was going on, LKY managed to sweet-talk the soldiers with his knowledge of japanese. He asked them for permission to go home and take his clothes.Fortunately, the guards agreed to his request but ordered him to return immediately. LKY never came back. t was only later than LKY discovered that the men who had been rounded up had been taken to Changi Beach and shot as part of the Sook Ching Massacre."
lest we forget
Never forget.
Grandmother told me they ran and hid in drains. Lots of girls were carted off to pleasure the japs.
There were actually quite a sizable number of Taiwanese and Korean soldiers that came to Malaya who committed atrocities.
"yup, for the koreans after having been annexed a lot of them joined the army out of sheer desparation."

"A monster indeed, felt so disgusted and uneasy after reading what he did. Better avoid reading it to prevent ruining your entire day. Can't believe such people exists.Hope the wife can recover from such trauma and move on."
read it and remember what happens behind closed doors in your neighbourhood. articles like this crop up fairly often so we cant act and live in a bubble of ignorance
The wife is disgusting as well.She gave her own niece & daughter to abuse as well.Booking a room & leading her niece to him & waiting outside to stop the girl from running awaay.I bet her family broke off tie with her once they knew
"I stopped reading at the part where the man used a dumbbell to hit her cause I was too weak to finish. After what you replied to me and I read on and the wife isn't totally innocent either...She gave her own niece & daughter to abuse as well.She didn't really gave her own daughter but decided not to tell, but she did bring her niece over... disgustingThe couple had sex and his wife then went to the toilet. Seeing his daughter awake, the man forced her to perform a sex act on him, even though he suspected he had an STD. This was later confirmed in hospital.When the mother came out of the toilet and saw what was happening, she was furious and shouted at her husband. He warned them not to tell anyone about the incident or he would beat them upThe accused had moved the family out to a hotel after an argument with his mother, with whom they had been staying.Even worse, the grandma didn't do shit all these time until her own son raped his own daughter?!"
"People can get really oblivious to what’s happening at home. Either she didn’t know, or she was also afraid of him."
The woman did not call the police so do u think he Will not do it again. It is as good as asking him to do it again & giving her to him againHer daughter knew her father will do it again so seek her grandmother for help.
"Where did you read that the wife waited outside the room in case her niece ran away? Couldn’t find that part. She’s a classic case of a bully’s victim. Succumbing to crimes for fear of further abuse. She’s terrified of him. Wouldn’t say she’s disgusting, just weak. Also she didn’t “give” her daughter. She stopped the abuse the first moment she saw it happening."
""
""
""
""
"How can you blame her in this situation? She feared for her own life and the life of her child, and she did try to protect her own daughter. You clearly don't even understand how she would think and act in an abusive relationship.The emotional and psychological burden on her to do these things just so her own husband won't hurt or kill her is overwhelming, and it could push anybody to do what she did for the sake of their own safety."
U should tell that to her niece as she scream for help she was saving her aunt & her daughter so the abuse was worth it.I can bet her family has disowned her & the mother or the father of the niece who grow up with her will never listen to such nonsense as they know of the harm she has caused themShe pushed her own niece to hell so she recieved no pity.
"You should tell that to the mother after she has been traumatised from years of abuse by her husband. She was forced by him to do those things, so now it's her fault? She's not the one who raped her nice, it's the rapist's fault. She's as much of a victim as the rest of them are.It's disgusting how you can blame a victim of abuse for the things she did under the order of her abuser. Next, you'll be telling me that she deserved to be abused by her husband. Go fly a kite."
""
"If you think about it in her shoes, she did not really have a choice. Yes, she could have refused, but that would mean getting beat up even more by that disgusting excuse of a human being. After suffering so much trauma, she probably wouldn't want to go through another round of it. It's not like she did it with evil intentions."
"the only victims are the niece & her daughter, both of whom she can protect if she had acted like the father's mother & called the policeThe mother or the father of the niece who grow up with her will never listen to such nonsense as they know of the harm she has caused them.She pushed her own niece to hell so she recieved no pity."
did you read the part of the article where it said that the husband threatened to kill her if she called the police? she must have been wanting to tell somebody but too scared for her own life to do so
She can act like the father's mother & called the policeThat was what the grandmother didDid u think such a man never threatened to kill his mother as well.Said what u like but ask yourself if she had destroy her niece life.She did & not only that she help to cover it upShe had a choice & instead chose to destroy her niece life.Her niece screamed but even then she refused to help.She was a 'good person & aunt' indeed.Tell that to the niece & her parents about all this & see their reactions.
"Classic abuser behaviour is separating the victim from potential helplines. It's exactly what he did to the wife - threatening her if she tried to tell her family or the police. Basically separating her from any help she can get if he continues his toxic behaviour, using death threats. This type of thing is conditioned over a long time.Plus the grandmother was his own mother. He probably hid this from his own mother. Would you want your mom to know if you were doing this kind of stuff? I guess not."
All that is based on what u thinkAll I based on what she didShe dragged her niece to hotel even when her niece did not to (Fact)she covered up the act (fact)she ignored her niece screams of help (fact)she could called police but chose to destroy her niece life (fact)that are the facts.Also her mother throw him out of the house so you think he care about her for if he did then she will never done that.
she ignored her niece's cry for help because she was afraid of her husband carrying out the death threats. how hard is it to understand this
The dude will only be 52 when released wtf
they should lock him up for life
Should be death sentence. Idk why rape isn’t ds since kidnapping is.
If rape is death sentence it may cause rapists to decide to murder their victims to hide the evidence since either way its death sentence
still doesnt explain why kidnapping is ds
Very good point. Any lawyer here can explain?
Kidnaping typically involves greater premeditation. But just guessing here. Was mainly just responding to say why rape shouldn’t carry ds. Tho believe me I also think these guys should rot in hell
This is why we need Batman the Punisher.Edit for the punisher.

What the actual fuck
"Guy gets off easy, especially with the gag order in place."
"Gag order is there to protect other 3 people involved, i am sure authorities wouldn't have issue to expose him if other innocent people were not involved."
Yeah you're right and I understand that. It just makes me feel he gets away easier with his name not mentioned anywhere tho. But I get the reasoning
"But i agreed that we should have sex offender registry, at least for those culprit who abused children."
"This kind, go jail also won't have an easy time."
"The monstrosity of humans knows no bounds.. Just when you thought it couldn't be any worse, another one comes up and makes all other crimes seem mild..25 years is too low, keep him in there for life, and let him out into the yard after whispering to inmates what he's done.. I'd gladly let my tax dollars be spent on him repeatedly being punished & recovering throughout his 25 years in there.. God damn it"
"I still can't believe that there are people saying that the mother is at fault for helping him. She's suffered years of abuse under him, and it's possible that she did alot of what she did because he would have tried to kill her if she didn't. It's not her fault that her hand was forced, it's the fault of the man who was forcing her."

This POS should not be allowed to have any contact with his wife and daughter ever again.
"I can’t even fathom assaulting a pregnant woman, let alone your own wife... wtfAnd that’s not even the worst part..."
I hope he gets his punishment in prison.
I don’t mind going to jail for skinning him alive.
"This is why I feel that men who engage prostitution are trashy... God, I think there were opportunities to reach out for help but years of abuse have seasoned the wife into thinking that she was trapped with her monster of a husband no matter what. This is truly tragic, had the grandmother known of this or intervened earlier the niece or their daughter (I'm just like nani the fuck at typing this could have escaped... 25 years isn't enough, he needs to be locked for life wtf."
"The mother of this monster definitely knows how violent her son was towards her daughter-in-law especially since they live with her and the violence has been occurring for years, but she turned a blind eye, possibly to protect her son and victim was not her flesh and blood, until it finally became her extended flesh and blood. It is common to see parents protect and embolden their violent sons. Infuriating and so wrong."
"'Monster' who prostituted wife, sexually assaulted 6-year-old daughter gets jail, caningSINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to 25-and-a-half years' jail, much more than what the prosecution had asked for, after he prostituted his wife, sexually assaulted his daughter and molested his wife's niece.He was also ordered 24 strokes of the cane and a fine of S$12,000 to disgorge the profits he had earned from the prostitution - the first case of its kind in Singapore.AdvertisementAll parties cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victims' identities.He pleaded guilty to one charge each of sexual assault by penetration of a minor, prostituting his wife, receiving payment over exploitation of a trafficked victim and aggravated outrage of modesty.Another four charges were taken into consideration in the sentencing of the 27-year-old, whom the prosecution described as a ""monster"" with ""unprecedented"" sordid sexual depravity.The High Court heard that the man married his wife in 2012, but had been physically abusing her even before that, slapping her face, and kicking and punching her.AdvertisementAdvertisementThe attacks became more frequent starting from 2015, with him assaulting her at least weekly and even while she was pregnant.His wife was therefore very fearful of him, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Eunice Lau, not daring to contact even her own family as her husband forbade her from doing so. He also threatened to kill her if she reported the abuse to the police.JOBLESS MAN ASKED WIFE TO WORK AS PROSTITUTE TO SUPPORT FAMILYAs her husband was jobless between 2010 and 2015, the 27-year-old woman supported her family with her S$1,800 salary working as a receptionist and office assistant.She gave this entire sum to her husband as he demanded and received a stipend in return.When she stopped working in September 2015, the couple could not support their family and considered aborting their second child. But the man hatched a plot to prostitute his wife so they could pay for their infant son's diapers and other expenses.The woman asked him to get a regular job, but he refused, saying that prostitution was a quick and lucrative way of earning money. The woman finally succumbed to his request because she feared his assaults and also because she needed to buy milk powder for her three-month-old baby.COACHED BY HUSBAND, WIFE STROVE TO MEET DAILY CUSTOMER QUOTACoached by her husband, who was familiar with prostitutes as he frequently hired them online, the hapless woman began working as a prostitute.She met her customers in hotels in Balestier, keeping to a daily quota of customers set by her husband. In this way, she gave sexual services to 138 men, earning about S$11,000 in just three months, which she handed over to her husband.On top of this, she gave in to her husband's demands to film her sex acts as he had a ""deviant fetish"" to see them, the prosecution said.Her prostitution was closely monitored by her husband, who once kicked her in the head as he felt she was taking too long to get customers. He also punched her face when he got jealous or if her clients paid her less than what they had agreed on.On one occasion, a former classmate of the woman had engaged her services without knowing who she was. The woman's husband wanted a threesome and hit his wife with a dumbbell when she could not persuade her classmate into it.MAN ORDERED NIECE TO BE DELIVERED TO HIM IN HOTELOn Aug 1, 2016, after beating his wife up for falling asleep, the man asked her to bring him her 13-year-old niece.She refused, suspecting that her husband would harm her niece and knowing that the child was taking her Primary School Leaving Examination.When he threatened to hit her, she fetched her niece from school, lying to the child that her mother had agreed. The child was taken to a hotel in Balestier, where her aunt had booked a room for the accused.There, the man molested the girl, who cried throughout the attack. The court heard that he stopped only when the child could not breathe due to the pillow he had pressed on her face to muffle her screams.He called his wife to the room and she apologised to her niece before taking her to a polyclinic.AFTER HE TARGETS HIS OWN DAUGHTER, MAN'S MOTHER CALLS POLICEThe man's crimes were finally discovered after he sexually assaulted his six-year-old daughter sometime between Jul 20, 2016, and Aug 14, 2016.The accused had moved the family out to a hotel after an argument with his mother, with whom they had been staying.The couple had sex and his wife then went to the toilet. Seeing his daughter awake, the man forced her to perform a sex act on him, even though he suspected he had an STD. This was later confirmed in hospital.When the mother came out of the toilet and saw what was happening, she was furious and shouted at her husband. He warned them not to tell anyone about the incident or he would beat them up.When the family returned to live with the man's mother, the young daughter told the grandmother what happened and she called the police.Psychiatric reports from the Institute of Mental Health indicated that the man was ""somewhat boastful of his sexual exploits"".He also appeared to have anti-social personality traits and continues to be a risk to his daughter, on top of posing a high risk of violence towards his wife, who has a personal protection order against him.The jail sentence was much longer than the 22 years the prosecution had asked for.Said DPP Lau, the three victims, all of whom were vulnerable women in the man's life, must ""suffer the trauma and degradation of the accused's actions for the rest of their lives"".0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

"For many families or relationships that are suffering from trauma, violence and abuse, there are other family members, friends, neighbours, people in the community, religious groups or even some doctors and nurses who attend to domestic violence victims, who KNOW but for various reasons, choose to turn a blind eye to the actions of violent perpetrators. Days turn into years and these abusers feel more emboldened and invincible. In many cases, the blood is also on people who know and whose silence is complicit in such tragedies."
WADDAFUG
What. The. Fuck.
It is in these cases you know there are real evil out there in the world. It's very real and very human...
Surprisingly light sentence for the crime.
Disgusting. This kind of person is truly the scum of earth. I hope he rots in prison
How this kind of man can get a wife is beyond me
He should be hanged instead. 3 lives ruined by 1 insane man
"The first few paragraphs mention he was charged with penetration of a minor, so that tells us what the sexual act he demanded of his 6(!!) year old daughter was.I don’t ordinarily hope for someone to suffer in prison, but considering how he’s reportedly “somewhat boastful of his sexual exploits” after all this, rehabilitation seems far-off for a monster of this degree; 25 years seems downright lenient."
Why does this subhuman trash get the privilege of being sentenced by human legislation. He should be ended.
"I hope the worst things imaginable will happen to him in prison, better still if he can take his own life. The world is better off without wasting oxygen on such scum."
Wow this one is hardcore. I think even on worldnews level.
Wow… fuck…
Physically and sexually abusing your wife and daughter. Exploiting your wife for sexual services. Sexually assaulting your wife's niece. This guy is fucking monster. How could such a disgusting man exist?
the fk
"6 years old, OWN DAUGHTER..There’s no way he’s not mentally ill because anyone in the right mind would not do it."
He should be given life imprisonment without possibility of parole?
"I don’t understand! Why can’t the govt pass a new bill to chop off pervert’s private? Especially pedos?! Drug trafficker gets death sentence already, why pedos get caned and jail time only? He will be in a male dominated environment with lots of sexual frustration, he’s gona be released with a vengence and he still has his “gun”!"
im for chemical castration or just saying 1-2-3 chop so this monster cannot do shit again to his daughter and niece
"This guy deserve to rot in hell. Chop off his disgusting banana and stuff it into his mouth. 24 canning is not enough. Should increase to 60!! Make sure he cannot sit and stand properly. Since he like to sex so much, please put him into same room with the gays. Let his inmate pressure his butt."
Wait. The daughter was 6 in 2016. The couple got married in 2012. So they had a kid in 2010 but went 2 years without marrying. This didn't raise a red flag with the mother's family?While the niece molestation was disgusting I want to sympathize with the wife. She's probably suffering from Stockholm's Syndrome after years of abuse so couldn't refuse.The dude should get life though. 25 years later he come out 50+ still can do harm.
The wife would have been a clear cut victim if she hadn't been so broken to have sacrificed her innocent niece. What a monster.

It is an actual practice to put certain things under a tree as a method of disposing them.
"And of those factors, is there a general estimate on how great an effect each one has?Also, given the conditions in the title, for a particular flat type (eg. 4 room, will the cheapest units be smaller?)"
The height. Higher floors command more money
"Yet strangely not when renting, from what I've seen. Why do you think that is?"
"I don't think so. Flats/apartments that are at a lower level/floor usually cost less to rent everywhere, not just in Singapore. The main issue is the noise from car and foot traffic, which living at a higher floor spares you from. This may not be an issue for some condos in Singapore because they are sort of shielded from the traffic by the enclosing walls."
"The view makes a difference. I suppose it depends on the launch, but the top floor flats in the block next to mine cost $13k more because the view is unobstructed while mine is partially obstructed"
Ah i see. Is there much variance in the area of a flat type in the same block? Because that’s the one drawback im actually concerned about for the units which are “starting price”
"What do you mean by area? If you mean floor area it's all standard. If you mean location within the block, mine is a point block not slab block. So all the units pretty much similar except for orientation"
Yep i meant floor area. Thanks!
Low..floors with maximum grants
No what. The flat price they put separate from the price with grants
"Not sure if it’s the same in BTO, but generally corner units for resale HDB units tend to be slightly more expensive than those “corridor” units of the same floor due to being slightly more private (your neighbours will not walk past your unit that often)"
"its height, the specific floor in some ""special"" cases, and the location of the unit on the level.Generally, the higher the floor, the more expensive it gets. Some times you can add as much as 5k/floor to the price of the flat.However, in certain special cases with regards to floor, there can be flats that flout the norm. For example, a 4th floor flat can be cheaper than a 3rd floor flat. In my BTO, I bought a flat on the 11th floor, but both the 8th floor and 10th floor flats were more expensive than mine (10k more for the 8th floor, 5k more for the 10th floor). I guess cos at the end of the day, Singaporeans are a pantang bunch in general.Finally the location of the unit. Is it a corner unit? Standalone or shared wall? near the rubbish chute? near the lift? near the staircase? All these will also play a part."
"What I really want to ask CCS:If we found the next Singaporean guy coming out from a 40 year prison sentence, showed him this clip and a clip from The Noose, would you be willing to bet your political career that he would be able to distinguish which was satire?"
How on earth is this the second choice for Prime Minister
He literally sounds like one of those uncles ranting at the kopitiam after too much Tiger.
"Actually, if you look at him and then look at the old videos of lky talking (esp the ones about the pilot's strike) I feel like it's quite clear that he's trying very hard to emulate lky. Down to the hand gestures.I dunno what's sadder the fact that this guy has no political character of his own, or that his attempt to emulate is such and atrocious failure."
"Now that you mention it, I can't unsee it. It's really a poor mockery of LKY."
His qualifications look really good on paper? He was in the same grc as lky..I dunno..
cos wearing white. if wear other colour ppl here would be mocking him and doubting his chances of even becoming an mp.
He'll probably lose his election deposit if he wasn't wearing white.
As if you don't mock him because he's wearing white lmao
oh boy don’t say that...it’s 2019 SG gov gets triggered very easily
"He's (or was) the Golden Boy, the living testament that Meritocracy Works TM. Single parent family, ex-RI alum, etc. But of course people were resentful of the fact that he was a paper general that got parachuted into politics too quickly and too soon, as well as his style of being folksy (/u/keechiu) seemed to most abit contrived.Not sure if i like how he got his comeuppance; yeah i mean har har keechiu lmao and all that, but what happened to him has the implicit meaning that money doesn't buy class and that low SES folks like myself will never break through to the aristocratic glass ceiling no matter how far they climb lol.I mean just look at everyone else in the thread clowning on CCS and his supposed lack of class - it's true, then, that money doesn't buy class?"
money doesn't buy class and that low SES folks like myself will never break through to the aristocratic glass ceiling no matter how far they climbSadly you could be right here mateThere are studies out there that suggest that low SES folks will always struggle to break into elite circles and industries. How are you going to talk to your peers about the golf trip your parents took you to at the age of 18 at Florida? Or how you went to volunteer at Rwanda during a gap year that you could afford to take?
"Sup keechiu, how u feel about all of this? Had breakfast yet? 😂"
"As I mentioned above, I really don't think the office of pm is a glass ceiling. It's pretty much the actual ceiling since it is the highest office in the country."
"I sense your unease but I don't think you are entirely right. Becoming the pm is not a ""glass ceiling"" in the normal sense of the word since only three people have been PM since the independence of this country. If it's a glass ceiling then I think we have more serious problems since no woman and no nonchinese person has ever broken that ceiling.You are right that the case of ccs seems to say that money can't buy you class, but then again this was never something that meritocracy was meant to provide. Meritocracy can though make you a contender for pm, which I think shows that the promise for social mobility is still (somewhat present).Disclosure: my dad dragged himself out of poverty and now we live an upper middle class life. I wouldn't say my dad is ""classy"" but he sure speaks way better than ccs."

Starting off with the assumption that your voter base is stupid is kind of rude. Even if it’s true. Doesn’t make you more relatable
"Assuming that he was willing to run for PM, he should have started preparing years ago.And by preparing, I mean going for public speaking, professional grooming, behavioural courses.Look at Tharman. Well spoken, well-dressed (not necessary branded, but executive-level presentable), charismatic.These things can be taught and learnt. CCS just comes across as an awkward penguin.CCS, if you're reading this, it's not too late, WSG has courses that can help you. I'm sure you can tap on your SkillsFuture credits to upgrade."
"Yes, Tharman is intelligent, articulate, has stage presence, charisma and can think on his feet. Watch him present himself on a global stage in front of learned peers. You can’t teach CCS these things now and expect him to not crumble, say, under questioning on BBC HardTalk."
chuckles he'll crumble like fresh apple pie with extra crumbly crust
"you know who did those classes justice? jack ma. he isnt the most eloquent, he practised but boy hes good now"
"A good example of how it's never to late. @CCS, don't waste your skillsfuture credits!"
CCS just comes across as an awkward penguin.i nearly laughed my head off
This video of CCS dancing should keep the laughs going:https://youtu.be/1iEQCCUsdHk?t=47
omg 🤣 future prime minister btw
"To be fair, CCS and Tharman grew up under very different circumstances: CCS was brought up by a single mother while Tharman's father was an erudite medical school professor."
"He also went to RI,RJC and went to University of Cambridge. Plus it has been decades alrd."
"Ri and rj doesn’t teach these social things though. Acs does more of that in terms of environment.Ri especially for ccs era was rather egalitarian. No one talked about family background, there were poor and middle class people aplenty. To use a crazy rich Asians example, Michael could’ve been RI while nick and his gang were all acs."
"In b4 ""But he's so humble! He wears a Casio watch and drives a Toyota!"""
Iron Sheik make him humble
Lol i saw him on Bloomberg. He's just awful at speaking.
"Eh, when other people do it is because they trying to buy votes in an auction k.When we do it is because we genuinely care about the rising cost of living on the poor (rising because we want to raise GST ourselves)"
Can someone pull out the video where LHL said need to increase GST means gahmen is not doing their job well?
I mean to be fair other people want to give EVERYBODY an equal amount of money but this budget is specifically giving the poor more money than the rest...

"You can have all the qualifications and experience. Hell, you might even show that you led a stat board or ministry with extraordinary success.But if you got no charisma, it's game over. By that same logic, someone who is ultra charismatic can win over the majority."
“Puppet ruler”. The actual power and decision making is actually made by others. It’s just a front to win votes
"Not really ""game over"" when u have affiliations with the ""powers that be""."
"If you speak like that in a truly democratic country, you are going get killed against more articulate opponents.Only in SG can you speak like that and still get paid millions.Uniquely Singaporean indeed."

Sandwiched middle class
He sounded more like arguing and scolding people than trying to get voters
Ironic.
"I guess his way of speaking panders to the elderly but I am assuming he is saying to give $3000 to the poor instead of $300 to everyone?I would support that scheme even if it meant I got nothing from the budget, no idea why people here are criticizing it. Blind criticism feels kinda childish to me"
"Thanks for sharing this video. I wasn't aware that campaigning had started.Good content though. However, Minister Chan's style felt a bit like imitating founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's style. Just a feeling.I hope Minister Chan finds his own style soon."

You add text box -> right click -> send to back ah?
"Not really. I added the text with Snapseed. If I had done with the ""send to back"" the bottom part of the 'E' would be entirely behind the building. :)This took some time manually removing some of the buildings."
What camera did you use?
"I took a timelapse with my GoPro and some shots with the phone. For some reason I can't seem to post videos in here, so I thought I'd post this. This was shot on my phone-OnePlus 5."

"Hello. Does anyone here have any idea which insurance company in Singapore might be able to provide personal insurance coverage for an individual who isworking on board a ship, overseasaway from Singapore for at least a total of 6 months in a year 3)one of the hazards of the job will be dealing with UXO (potentially removing or detonating with the assistance of ROV), if found beneath the seabed.Reason for the question is because my current insurer, or the underwriter, is not willing to cover if anything should happen to me while I’m on board. I forgot if there was a specific reason as to why they are unwilling to cover, I’m gonna guess it’s due to the UXO part?I’m also reluctant for now to run around and ask insurance companies if they do provide coverage for someone like myself. So here I am asking the Top Minds of r/sg if they have got any answers for me.Thanks!"
Are you looking for personal accident plan?
Yeah it’s probably that. Personal accident insurance thingy.
You may try Chubb insurance.
Thank you! Will look it up.
Wouldn’t the employer cover employee’s accident insurance? Or is this an additional insurance above what the company is covering?
"Hi, yes the employer does that. I was just thinking of an additional insurance above that."
I am not from insurance.My Fren (insurance agent) said they do cover people with high-risk jobs eg firefighters or miners. You have to shop around with several insurers on the premium rates u hv to pay. Some may charge higher premiums for certain jobs while some charge a flat rate - dependent on their own research.Ultimately you have to ask various insurers to see which plan fits your Budget and requirements
Okay thank you for the assistance! Looks like i may have to shop around after all.
"I have been running a consistent 9 min for my 2.4km for 4 years just as a way to keep fit.However, I would like to push my limits and see if I can go further but not sure of how to do it.Anyone could kindly suggest any tips on how to TRAIN at the stadium.Thank you very much!"
I think you are on the wrong sub. You can run faster than most singaporeans.
ty !!
"wow it's gonna be tough to improve your timing but try something like this:workout 1: 8×400m at 8'30'' pace with 1.5 min rest in betweenworkout 2: 4×800m at 8'30'' pace with 3 mins rest in betweenthen slowly work down the rest periods between each setalso, video yourself and see how you can improve your running form to be more efficient.last, get a pair of racing flats"
HAHA i see. Great! Thank You!
"wow just saw that u r j1, you should consider training with the track and field or cross country team."
HAHA icic. im just running to keep fit 😂😫
they could probably use you to get some points during nationals
😂😂 you flatter me. TYVM!!
"I honestly think that at this stage you should seek slightly more professional help. You are ‘as fast as can be’ for the norm, hence specialist advice would be good."
i see. ty for the advice!
"I saw the title. Clicked and read.""I have been running a consistent 9mins for my 2.4km""Stops reading."
I think 9min is spectacular enough
haha ty!!
HumbleBrag
Run with me. I would observe ur running form and give u advice. PB 7:50 . Anyone can Message me if interested
what does PB stand for?
personal best
ahh icic. dang 7:50 is hella fast
Chop off one of your arms. That will lighten your weight by a few kg and thus increase your speed.
ahh icic tyty. will this mean ill have more difficulty running with 1 arm since i cant swing both arms anymore 😂😬 :/ HAHA jokes jokes.
ahh icic ty!! but wouldnt that make it much harder to run thus causing my timing to be slower since now i camt swing both my arms. HAHAH joke joke 😂😫
Wah you're the envy of most guys here. 9 minutes!
hahaha..tyty. 😁
"There would probably be conditioning involved, improving certain muscle groups and focusing on strengthening them."
ahh icic. okay okay. ill look into it. HAHA tyty!!
"Yeah you're prolly faster than most peeps here, try /r/running"
haha ty ty. I'll try there :)
Any faster that 9 mins you gotta need professional training. Nutritions and special equipments is needed push your limits further.
ahh icic. ty for the advice!
Singapore heading down the hikikomori route because of skewered work life balance and increasing costs to raising a family? Is anyone surprised?
"Yes, hikikomori. Or closely related concept like grass-eating otakus.The Japan Trap is a complex multi-factor problem. Career and family are closely linked. Once the economy slumps and careers are affected, it leads to a generation of people with no incentive to start families. Individuals lose purpose. As many areas of life are linked. Hence you get multiple problems: less marriage, less babies, less employed, on and on... But, is the Japan Trap related even to immigrants? Maybe for Singapore, yes, but I don't this this is the case for Japan.But somehow, I can't comment on Singapore. Will curbing immigrants solve the problem? Maybe. Do immigrants cause the problem? Maybe. I'm more of a hindsight person and cannot speculate."
"Japan is actually following our footsteps in regards to immigration, they weren't this open back when our floodgates were generous.Japan does so to attempt to deal with the shortfall of able workers as its population goes rocket shaped. I guess they saw how well it worked for us. Still, you need to remember that the local culture there is so ingrained to never really treat you as one of them unless you can behave like they do."

EDMW BBFA spotted.
Holy shit you just say out the thing I read few days ago in another website
I'm more surprise u made the comment. One of the key points made was income has kept ahead of inflation yet according to you cost of raising a family have kept ahead of inflation. Any data on this
"Seems like a in thing to affix a name onto -nomics now. But ours at least looks more auspicious. Hengnomics has like ""Lucky we did this"" feel to it, LOL."
heng-ah-nomics
Bahahaha I would love for that to appear in an article
it felt more like heng it wasnt recorded
"Not really, I've seen Freakonomics (it's a book). In the case of Japan, we're probably talking about ""Abenomics"" but thats not slapping -nomics into a random name, that IS just a meme attached to Shinzo Abe. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abenomics"
"Abenomics is not a meme, and has been directly referenced by the Japanese Government on their materials before."
"Now Heng wants to drive the ratio still lower to 35 percent in two steps by January 2021. Two more foreigners need to be let go while keeping the same 20 locals in employment. Since businesses need to grow, they’ll have to make up the difference by hiring more locals instead. It’s a risky strategy because firms can always curb expansion or shut down. But so far at least, the gamble has worked.Interesting. I'm working in a SME and they're facing problem hiring more Singaporeans actually. Singaporean demand higher pay but as a SME, they can only afford so much. This is where some company resorts to hiring and abusing intern.Hiring aside, with our aging population, I wonder how would this work out. I know nursing and construction has a bad reputation in Singapore and many avoid it. Who will fill in those roles? Honestly I know lots of Singaporean always complain they don't even know they're in India, China or Philippine at times, but foreign workers are much needed imo."
I can relate to this having previously worked for a local SME. We constantly struggle to find the balance between willing locals and the abundance of foreigners who are willing to do whatever it takes.
Isn't it because there are abundance of foreigners will to work for lower pay that affects the pay of the locals?
"Curious, how much does your SME boss pay himself? such that he/she is unable to afford the salary of a Singaporean employee?"
"No idea what my boss's pay is, I doubt bosses tell people their pay.What I do know is that past year (2018), my boss didn't pay himself salary for a period cause the company isn't earning. Rumour from HR and reason given by boss to people who didn't receive their performance bonus this year."
ohhh. okay! thanks for your reply!
You should make plans to leave
"If the SME cannot afford to pay their labor then they should not exist. Simple free market economics.No such thing as ""they can afford to only pay so much"" unless the bosses are suffering as much as the employees"
"BloombergOpinion AnalysisAging Singapore Tries to Avoid the Japan TrapBy Andy Mukherjee | BloombergFebruary 18 at 10:01 PMJapan has aged; Singapore is aging. Japan’s workforce is shrinking; Singapore’s has plateaued. Japan’s homogeneous society has struggled with immigration; Singapore’s island culture has been welcoming of foreigners, though increasingly less so.So is the city-state scoring an own-goal by inviting a demographic decline and Japanese-style lost decades? After Monday’s annual government budget, in which Singapore Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced stronger curbs on immigrants in service industries, questions around his economic strategy have become more urgent. For Singapore firms, hiring the right talent in the right quantities and at the right prices is already the No. 1 headache. And yet the bureaucrat-turned-politician, tipped to take over as Singapore’s next prime minister, is inflicting more pain.So what exactly is Heng’s big idea behind choking off supplies of foreign workers?Consider the change in the labor composition of Singapore’s service industries since 2013. Back then the dependency ratio ceiling was 45 percent. Hence, a business with 20 full-time locals (citizens or permanent residents) could employ 16 foreigners. In 2015, the ratio was reduced to 40 percent. For the same 20 locals, three foreigners had to be cut. Now Heng wants to drive the ratio still lower to 35 percent in two steps by January 2021. Two more foreigners need to be let go while keeping the same 20 locals in employment. Since businesses need to grow, they’ll have to make up the difference by hiring more locals instead. It’s a risky strategy because firms can always curb expansion or shut down. But so far at least, the gamble has worked.📷Every member of households with at least one working person has seen inflation-adjusted income from work grow almost 23 percent between 2013 and 2018, compared with less than 10 percent in the previous five years. Is a permanently anti-immigration stance the right one for a small, open economy (population: 5.6 million)? Contrast again with Japan, but this time focus on the difference in how the countries are responding to their shared demographic challenge of low fertility. Japan, since 2013, has embarked on a bold program of monetary adventurism to beat back deflationary expectations, engineer low or negative real interest rates and coax employers to invest more and raise wages.Abenomics, as the plan is known, has had only limited success. Singapore, by comparison, has gone deeper into the engine room of the economy, and sought a stronger (rather than weaker, as in Japan’s case) currency. And while Japan has been forced to temper the force of its monetary expansion by raising sales-tax rates, Singapore has used its enviable fiscal resources to throw money at low-wage employees. Heng’s latest budget proposals will see 60-year-old, low-income Singaporean workers get 30 percent of their compensation from the state. That’s on top of a new  S$8 billion ($5.9 billion) support package for seniors.Cementing popular support for the ruling People’s Action Party ahead of an election and a leadership change may be part of the motivation. But there’s also economic logic behind the budgetary largess. The city has systemically attacked pockets of inefficiency and high consumer prices in everything from transport and telecom to media and banking. Singapore has even crossed swords with developers who wanted a Hong Kong-style mania in property prices after a prolonged, policy-induced decline. Instead, they got whacked with new government curbs instead. It’s hard to say how this experiment will end. The Singapore dollar may have to stay strong to ensure that an artificially tight labor market doesn’t trigger an inflationary spiral, though there’s no sign of one yet. If anything, real household incomes have grown handsomely over the past five years partly because inflation has been low. A strong currency amid weakening global demand could spill over as frothy asset prices. Hence the property curbs will probably stay. (I was expecting them to be relaxed after the leadership transition, together with a little more impetus for immigration.) 📷Even as Finance Minister Heng thins down the foreign worker category, he wants to weed out the less experienced among them. Encouraging automation of routine tasks is key to the plan. The past three years of rapid growth in Singapore’s labor productivity must endure. Otherwise, without additional foreign labor, annual GDP expansion can’t be much higher than the long-term productivity growth of 1.5 percent. Singapore will lose out to rivals (unless London suffers badly from a botched-up Brexit and China intrudes too much in Hong Kong’s autonomy).Singapore is special: Not many global cities get to write their own immigration policies. However, if Hengnomics does succeed, there will at least be a different route to breaking out of the tyranny of demographics than money-printing and negative interest rates.To contact the author of this story: Andy Mukherjee at amukherjee@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

"Singapore has even crossed swords with developers who wanted a Hong Kong-style mania in property prices after a prolonged, policy-induced decline. Instead, they got whacked with new government curbs instead.When did this happen?"
Last year. Every developer was gearing for bumper prices instead they got another round of cooling measures. Even cdl was complaining
absd i think its called
developer side costs got hit a lot harder than consumer side stuff like absd
is that a good or a bad thing? (asking as an outsider)
The interesting thing about this is that the government reported higher than usual Stamp duty which resulted in the Gahmen handouts.

"suicide booths, just saying"
"""He claimed that the Wee's low IQ exempted him from National Service, but the prosecutor disputed this, saying there was no proof.""is mindefs record keeping so bad that they couldn't just verify this"

Low IQ can be exempted from NS?!
im pretty sure iq of 60 can exampt you. its most likely gonna be endagering people arnd him uh.
"Not sure about Singapore, but US won’t admit anyone with an IQ lower than 80 into their Military. Maybe can use that as reference?The rationale is that-that their research concluded that that is the minimum IQ for a person to function in the Military, and it’s their job to be able admit as much people as possible."
So trump bone spur was really about iq
"Not sure about Singapore, but US won’t admit anyone with an IQ lower than 80 into their Military. Maybe can use that as reference?In Israel they conscript them anyway, even those with Down's"
The rejects go to the police which is why we're always reading about exemplary actions of American police on Reddit.
How is that surprising?
Did the victim recover fully
"You can never fully recover from such traumatic injuries, mentally and physically."
"District Judge Marvin Bay agreed with the prosecution's position, noting that the prosecutor had been ""extremely moderate not seeking any caning in your sentence"".Unless I'm reading this wrongly, it seems that a low IQ of 60 means diminished responsibility and does not justify caning even though it was an extremely vicious and violent attack. Baffling."
"An IQ of 70 or below is considered an intellectual disability. Intellectual disability does seem to warrant a sort of lenience in court as it appears to be taken like a sort of mental illness.There’s not enough legal precedence in Singapore with regards to this, so this is definitely up to the judge’s discretion"
"Gives new meaning to the phrase""I stomp u"""
o.ostaring contest.come on lah. like this also fight?
"I didn't know low IQ exempts you from NS.I mean, yeah pretty obvious not to put a weapon into a retard's hands but there are get-arounds for ""NS"". Messboy for example.During my service there was a clerk in my company whom I am pretty sure had a really low IQ. Maybe he met the minimum requirements for NS but Jesus fucking christ was he stupid.I don't remember his name but he was this short chinese scrawny pale guy with slurred speech and his mouth was always open.All he did was literally sleep in the ops room or wander around the office. The enciks knew he was retarded and excused him from COS/DO duties. His only role was pretty much to collate morning parade state to submit to HQ and that was it. Maybe some miscellaneous duties like water the plants and some paperwork but that was his ONLY responsibilities for his entire 2 year service.AND he could still fuck it up.There was one time he submitted the MORNING parade state at 4pm. HQ got pretty mad that day.Like it sounds pretty mean spirited for me to talk about him this way but when he is YOUR clerk and even by treating and talking to him nicely and he STILL FUCKS UP YOUR LEAVE APPLICATION, its hard to stay nice at him."
Err I've seen a guy who acted like he was mentally challenged during recruit phase causing the whole platoon punishments every single day. But lo behold when I saw him again a few months later in camp reporting sick to the mo. he was fully decked out in ah beng branded clothing looking all normal. He even had the gall to challenge some of us to a fight for the verbal abuse he received from the recruit days.
"At the time of the attack, he was already on bail for assaulting someone else. After the Golden Mile attack, he was granted bail, and then proceeded to assault someone again at St James.I think he needs some professional counselling, in addition to prison time. Doing time is one thing, but some help should be given to help him with anger management."
With this kind of violence... He needs A Clockwerk Orange style of therapy
Probably should have gone to a Milk Bar instead of a Thai Bar.
"Man who stomped on fallen man's face in 'barbaric assault' at Golden Mile gets jailSINGAPORE: A 24-year-old man who was caught in a viral video stomping on a man's face at Golden Mile Complex was sentenced to jail for three years and nine months on Tuesday (Feb 19).Wee Boon How carried out a four-minute assault on the victim, 26-year-old Bong Hong Yun, in the wee hours of Oct 11, 2017, at the first floor of Golden Mile Complex.AdvertisementIt began when the two men got into a staring incident near a pub in the complex, before they began exchanging vulgarities.This progressed to punches and kicks, with their friends trying to separate them to no avail. Eventually, the victim fell to the ground but Wee continued his assault, punching his face until he lost consciousness.Wee rained blows on the victim's face before stamping on his face, kicking him multiple times.VIDEO: Police are looking for the man who was seen stomping repeatedly on another man at Golden Mile Complex https://t.co/oAAgkctpEk pic.twitter.com/GEzGddpdbT — Channel NewsAsia (@ChannelNewsAsia) October 14, 2017AdvertisementAdvertisementThe victim was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital where he was warded for two days before being re-admitted for facial reconstruction as he had suffered fractures.VICTIM INSULTED ATTACKER'S MOTHER, SAYS DEFENCEWee's lawyer told the court that the victim had insulted Wee's mother.This was an ""extremely raw nerve"", he said, as Wee's mother had abandoned him and his father when Wee was only seven years old.Additionally, Wee had a low IQ of 60 and studied only up to Secondary 2, he said.The prosecution asked for a jail term of at least three years and nine months, saying that footage of the attack showed the ""savageness"", protraction and ""absolute violence"" Wee used.Deputy Public Prosecutor Zhou Hongyi said Wee ""has not learnt his lesson"", pointing to the fact that he had carried out the attack while on bail for assaulting another man in April 2017.After the Golden Mile attack, Wee again reoffended while on bail, assaulting another man at St James Power Station on Oct 28, 2017.She added that Wee also attacked the victim's friend, and that while he claimed to have surrendered himself to the police, he did so only after ""much persuasion"" from the authorities.PROSECUTION TOOK INTO ACCOUNT WEE'S LOW IQ, DID NOT ASK FOR CANINGIn response to the defence's arguments, she said the prosecution had taken into account Wee's low IQ.The defence asked for a jail term that was three months shorter than what the prosecution asked for, saying Wee wishes to turn over a new leaf and is trying to find help to curb his anger management issues.After leaving school, Wee worked as a door-to-door salesman selling ice cream and keychains, said the lawyer.He claimed that the Wee's low IQ exempted him from National Service, but the prosecutor disputed this, saying there was no proof.Before being taken into remand in November 2017, Wee worked as an attendant at an economic rice stall, earning about S$1,600 a month.He gave S$300 of this to his father, whom he lived with in a one-room flat, said the defence.Wee, who is now the father of a young son, pleaded guilty to one charge of causing grievous hurt and two charges of rioting.District Judge Marvin Bay agreed with the prosecution's position, noting that the prosecutor had been ""extremely moderate not seeking any caning in your sentence"".""There is no place for acts of wanton group violence, especially in a crowded public place in modern-day Singapore,"" he said, calling the assault ""barbaric"".0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

"Is there anyone here that has done a deed poll?Any recommendations for lawyers?I understand that I must submit a request for ic name change after I change my name, but is passport compulsory as well?"
"Did my Deed Poll a few times, always used Vexus Law because it was cheap, efficient, and I had all my paperwork done on the same day.Some people have had bad experiences with Vexus, but I've personally not had any issues."
"Probably prying too much, but why would someone want to change their name so many times?"
What kind of bad experience? Do i have to notify before going down?
"A quick google and you can see the ""bad experiences"" lol. They've changed their name now but this is the same firm: https://www.lavocatlaw.com/services/deed-poll-change-of-name, you can see all the info there."
"I did a Deed Poll just a few months ago (Dec 2018).Yes, you will need to change your IC as well as your passport. Your passport is a form of photo identification of you as well. Do also remember to update your bank accounts, insurances, credit cards and anything that was linked to your old name.Most importantly, make sure you keep the original Deed Poll safe. It states who you were before and who you are now. Some stuff like university transcripts may not be re-issued in your new name, so your Deed Poll is basically the document that says you were the person that got the degree and now you’re known by a new name.Lawyer wise, you can approach any law firm to have your Deed Poll done. I have friends who would recommend more well known firms for fears of meeting unscrupulous lawyers in lesser know firms. It should cost you between $50-$100 or so. Expect the total sum to be more as replacing your IC, passport and driving license requires fees."
"Aside from a name change, what else is a Deed Poll used for?If i changed my name, can it be anything I want? Am I required to have a name and surname?"
"From what I know, a Deed Poll is mainly for a name change.There are limits to the name that you choose. ICA can reject the name if it is vulgar, offensive, contain any honorific titles, can potentially cause any unrest or misunderstanding. If you are modifying a chinese name, the chinese characters has to be in any chinese dictionary recognised by the registrar.Edit: other than those above, I don’t think there are any other restrictions. Usually if there is the lawyer will inform you."
"Ok, good to know. Thanks!"
"Yup I did a deed poll a few years back (2015) as well and the admin work was quite a hassle.Any lawyer should be able to do a deed poll for you. (I got a friend to help me out). Generally it costs about $50 for it to be done. After that, you have to change both your IC and passports.If you are still studying, just update the school with a copy of the deed poll so they’ll print the correct name on graduation certs.

Had one done at Vexus law corporation. Decently priced
Having A in yellow and B in green seems a little counterintuitive
"Agree, especially since it starts with Red:Cnice visualization idea though OP"
True thanks for the feedback tho! Initially i thought using yellow is almost akin to a Gold rating but clearly that wasn’t effective - i might do a follow up vis to this!
"I haven't been back to Singapore for 16 years now, and I fondly remember the triple Mcspicy. Out of curiosity I went to McD Singapore and couldn't find that on the menu, only the double. Is the Triple Mcspicy not a thing anymore?!?!!?"
You can always add on the patty. Make a quadruple mcspicy. Go where no man has yet gone
"Ultra,Fiery,Anus!"
And repaint your toilet the next morning
don't understand how people can eat spicy food and get diarrhea...I only get diarrhea when I eat spoilt food
Don't think it's that hard to understand that people have different bodies.
Yeah I used to be able to take McSpicy with garlic chill added without issue. But now even the McSpicy didn't taste anywhere spicy to my mouth. My stomach sure reminds me of the consequence the very next day.
They just need more training.
How do u add extra patty? Is it a new option? I've tried looking for it in the self order booths and couldn't find it
"I don't think it was ever a thing, you have to buy a double mcspicy as well as a mcspicy. No box can hold that monster."
Yeah Googling doesnt bring up much either except for customized orders.I think the menu planners at mcd's ain't sadist enough to come up with such a thing either.
"Yeah it's not on the official menu. But you can always custom order.McD should really keep their prosperity/samurai burgers on year round, they are in another world as compared to the daily collection."
"I can't remember when it happened, but many many years ago, McD sold McSpicy double as the normal offering. The patty previously was probably only half as thick, somewhat like the mcchicken thickness. McSpicy triple was probably a thing back then.Now, McSpicy has only 1 thick patty. The ""mega"" version would then be double McSpicy."
Please apply petroleum jelly to your anus.You are welcome.
"never understood that. Unless the patty itself has changed, I could down two triple mcspicies and not feel a thing"
Weird flex but ok
"Can just custom orderMy friend always buy Mcspicy + add patty. It's strictly different from Double Mcspicy, cos no middle bread + lesser veggie fillings.If they can cater to that weird shit, don't see why they can't add one more patty onto Double Mcspicy too.16 years ago I was too young lol didn't really eat Mac then, but yeah I've never seen such a thing before ever since I started eating Mac abt 12 yrs ago.edit: you made me realise Mcspicy has always been my go-to for Macs. (Other than seasonal burgers) Never remembered really buying other burgers much. Probably less than ten Mcchicken and like... 4(?) Filet-o-fish?"
Double mcspicy doesn't have a middle bun or extra veggie. You might be confusing between a double cheeseburger and a big mac?
Oh lol I've never ordered Double mcspicy before whoops. Thought I remembered my friend's reasoning but I guess I forgot it after all. Not sure why he fucking does that if there's no difference LOL
Mcdonalds didn't use to have double mcspicy as an official menu item.
"And that's relevant?edit: oh figured what you mean. But he's doing it now. ""16 yrs ago"" we were all kids where got money to buy Mac."
what? since when does double mcspicy have a bread in between?
"I'm assuming the custom order needs to be done over the counter, as opposed to the self-service kiosk?"
Teriyaki burger was really good.Meat was tender and rather savory.Bread was very soft.Too bad discontinued.
It was always maximum double McSpicy iirc
"Hi everyone! I am not entirely sure if this deserves a post of its own, but I hope to hear the opinions of anyone who are affected by this bus route change!Personally, from what I have noticed is that this change will greatly affect 2 groups of people - Malaysian students who cross the border everyday for schools in Marsiling and Woodlands Secondary. As an alumnus from one of those school, I feel the pain of those students having to wake up early for their travels to school and knowing that their only direct bus to their schools is going to be cut off will be painful for them. Even though it may not affect me as much as I thought it would, I thought that these students deserve a better and convenient way to their schools which the current route provides.Don't get me wrong, the changes are great. Greater accessibility to Marsiling Mall, Fuchun Sec/Pri School, and Woodlands Polyclinic. Also, it kinda makes sense of this change to take place as the Old Woodlands Town Centre is currently under demolition.Anyway, that is just my 5-cents rant. I would love to hear from those affected and living around the area! Any thoughts?https://www.smrt.com.sg/Portals/0/Announcement/2019/Service%20913%20Publicity%20Poster%20-%20final%20V1_7.pdf"
"I kinda feel that there should be another bus service (idk maybe call it 914 or something) for the new route.It just feels weird that after so many years, 913 is going to change up its route."
"Yups! I have been using 913 for my lifetime, so adapting to it will be tough."
"I think people may get very confused with the new 913M service, it should be renumbered to something else instead (905 perhaps?)"
"I think for LTA point of view , since all woodlands inter-town service West loop loops at Woodlands Central. LTA wants to reduce route from overlapping each other hence changing 913 route to serve the newly built BTO flats. As you mentioned just now , yes is quite bad to remove direct route for Malaysian student to their primary/secondary school , but the good thing is it will allow people to transfer to MRT system at Marsling instead of woodlands. Which will prevent overcrowding. Introducing new route like 914 will be unlikely, because it won't have much demand since it is newly build , the catchment area isn't big as well."
I use 913 to go to the Checkpoint fairly often so I feel greatly affected because I lose my direct bus there 🙃
"True that it affects the students coming in from Malaysia but isn't the traffic quite bad in that particular area? From my understanding, it used to throw off the bus schedules quite a bit."
"I have been taking the bus route for a very long time. I do agree from what you said, but from what I observed, it is mostly during weekends?"
Not really. During most peak hours and evenings too I think.
Thanks!
"Pictures are the median salary of Singapore citizens and PRs, as at June 2018. Median salary here is not inclusive of employer CPF, so it's just your contractual salary plus allowances, and 1/12th of bonuses earned in FY2018. First picture is for all genders, second picture is for Males, third pictures is for females.Interesting takeaways:Median fresh grad pay for degree holders is likely to be only $2,882, not the $3k+ commonly hyped. See the 2nd picture, which shows male degree holders in age range of 20-24 having median salary of $2,882. Males should only graduate at age 23 to 24, so these are the people with less than 1yr work xp.Females are staggering more likely to have a degree. Compare data for age bracket 25-29 between males and females. Males earn more, no matter the education level. But median salary of females are still higher, implying that most females fall in the degree-holder category.Holy shit the wage gap between genders from age 35 onwards."
"Yeah, pregnancy and children really does that. Women tend to take a break, and that sort of kills hyper-competitive careers in Tech/Finance/Research etc."
How do guys with NS graduate with local uni degree at 23 years old? Wouldn't most of them get their full time job at 25?
"poly diploma, top up with SIM degree only 1-2 years"
"Well, then I guess the idea that fresh grads get $3k+ still holds true for local unis? In fact, it might be higher than that since the median is $4k."
NTU business 3 years Honours as well
"Regarding median fresh grad pay for degree holders, it also includes private uni degrees which don't accord the same level of recognition. They often have module exemptions with some able to be completed in a year, and may skew the numbers downwards.Gender wage gap was interesting, but it's one of those classic examples in stats that don't tell the full story."
"Yup research have shown that when you narrow the data down to men and women in the same industry with the same job scope, the wage gap is rather negligible. What we see as a gap is probably due to the different industries the different gender tend towards to."
"What we see as a gap is probably due to the different industries the different gender tend towards to.Well if that is the case, then it's also a worthwhile question to ask why the industries that women tend toward generate less income than the ones men tend toward."
Would also be interesting to question why do men and women diverge into different industries. For instance FASS in NUS has a M:F ratio of 1:2.5 while that of Engineering/Computing is the other way round .
Do FASS graduates get comparable pay to engineers? No? There's your answer right there.
Er how does this answer anything.It just begs more questions like why are more women going to FASS even though it earns less than engineering.
""
""
"Well the classical reason is they have different priorities. Men tend to prioritise income more - perhaps partially because they need to (people will happily marry a wife with lower income, but not vice versa). At any rate, certain careers have horrible work life balance - consulting, finance, R&D - or are dangerous - construction, military, mining, refining - and men tend to take these careers a lot more than women."
"This is all not wrong, but I think that it's only a half answer. The full issue is why men prioritize income, cannot marry a woman with higher income, and are more willing to sacrifice work life balance.On the last point though I'm not sure if that's even true. Millenials in general (and not just women) highly value work life balance."
"Yup, plus I would think that this would be less of an issue esp in a developed and more progressive country like sg. My general perception ( as a 20y/o ) is that millennials no longer conform to traditional gender roles and wouldn’t mind their wives having a higher income than themselves . Doubt this is the major reason behind the skewed ratio but certainly a possible contributing factor."
"For private uni students it's not only module exemption, but lack of proper curriculum as well. For local unis every module have group assignments/projects, but not private uni."
Point 3 is definitely interesting.
I just realised how underemployed I am....

"Former opposition leader Benjamin Pwee to join Singapore Democratic PartySINGAPORE — Weeks after leaving the political party that he has led for six years, Mr Benjamin Pwee revealed on Tuesday (Feb 19) that he has decided to join the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP).In his Facebook post, Mr Pwee, the former leader of the Democratic Progressive Party, said that he and a few others have submitted their membership application forms to the party.""We share and believe in the values and ideals that SDP stands for, and they have many other like-minded credible people,"" said Mr Pwee. ""We also believe in their organisational resources and capabilities as a long-standing political party in Singapore.""Mr Pwee told The Straits Times earlier this month that he planned to join a “bigger, more effective” party, after having led the DPP for six years.The DPP’s central executive committee accepted Mr Pwee’s resignation as secretary-general on Jan 26, with Mr Hamim Aliyas – previously the party’s chairman – assuming Mr Pwee’s post.Speaking to TODAY on Tuesday, Mr Pwee said he chose to join SDP because believes in the “many quality and credible people they have and are attracting”.“We also have many good friends in the SDP”, he said.Aside from him, there are three to four other individuals who have also applied to join the SDP. They include some who also recently resigned from the DPP as well as people “from my personal circle of government scholar friends”, Mr Pwee said.He noted that they are still waiting for SDP's official decision regarding their applications and will leave it to the SDP to announce its decision on whether it will take in Mr Pwee and the other individuals.TODAY has reached out to the SDP for comment.When asked why he decided to make the move only now, Mr Pwee said that the DPP had known about his intentions for the past year. It was a “considered decision”, he added.Mr Pwee said: “It is not a knee-jerk decision and it is not about jumping ship. It is about consolidating into a larger, more well established party and combining forces and resources for a similar shared cause.”Prior to leading the DPP, Mr Pwee was a member of the Singapore People’s Party headed by veteran politician Chiam See Tong.Back in the 2011 General Election, he contested in the five-member Bishan-Toa Payoh group representation constituency as part of the SPP team.In the 2015 polls, he again contested in the constituency, this time as as leader of the DPP.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"
"My respect for SDP goes down if they accept him. People who switch parties too often are not reliable.Oh well at least WP, Tan Cheng Bock and Chiam's party didn't take him in.And paper/prior work experience cred isn't everything. So-called heavyweights Tan Jee Say / Ang Yong Guan only got ~20% in GE2015, but Lee Li Lian of a much humbler background easily beat the PAP candidate in 2013."
"""We share and believe in the values and ideals that SDP stands for, and they have many other like-minded credible people""This guy has very flexible values. Pretty sure CST's SPP whom he was previously a part of had very different values vs SDP"
Correct lah. The shared value is to win election.

I searched some online but couldn't find much. When did leaseholds and enbloc start? Are there any interesting stories/facts there?
Leaseholds probably started with the first batch of flats.
Hmm leasehold (yes even 999 year lease is leasehold) started off during colonial times and the 99-year lease only kick in when the PAP took over because of the need to develop land to house people blah blah blah.Enbloc really sort of kicked off in the 90s as a means to redevelop and rejuvenate the urban areas of Singapore. I say it only kicked in the 90s because the first few places to go were private condos/residences that were built in the 60s and maybe the 70s sitting often on prime land.
"why aren't there similar enbloc laws in other countries that have leasehold property, e.g. HK or UK?"
Thanks! Are there any links/books I can go to find out more?
"If they prepared it before hand(bonus if they group individual denominations together) I'm fine.It's the ones who dig and dig and dig (from their purse or bag) but can only manage to gather one coin at a time that kinda triggers me, but only when the queue is long. If I'm next in line I'll give some leeway. Still not very nice tho.Same goes for that person who refuses to take his or her ez link outta the bag / shirt pocket even tho the red light has been showing for the umpteenth time."
Unker actually just dumped a dusty plastic bag of coins onto the cashier and asked her to count and deduct from the total amount due... Bagging his items took 30seconds but counting the coins took almost 5min cos when cashier told the uncle the final amount he insisted the value was 10c higher..
Uncle should just use the self pay which accepts currency.
"I recommend this, just dump the coins in and let the machine sort it out.Not sure what would happen if the uncle want to dispute the machine's counting."
Uncle should just use the self pay which accepts currency.I thought self pay was card only. Didn't notice they upgraded the machines.
I don’t think Cold Storage has it yet but I’m pretty sure NTUC accepts coins/notes.
"If we were to be kind, we could see it as the poor chap had to scrape whatever he could to get some basic groceries. I'm leaning towards him being oblivious and more of a ""money is money what"". Could have at least sorted the coins or made the transaction during off peak hours."
Ok la actually this happened at fairprice finest at bukit timah and uncle paid those coins and then used notes to pay the balance haha
Haha what about those who rush for the bus and fiddle with their bag to look for the ez while the rest stands in the rain?
TO THE GALLOWS!
Can't blame me when the cashier asked for a 20 cents coin
"Actually, there are legal tender limits on how many coins you can use for a specific payment, so the cashier could have rejected him.They are only obliged to accept up to $2 in 5 cent, 10 cent and 20 cent coins; and up to $10 in 50 cent or 1 dollar coins. Source"
"Huh, I worked at fairprice and there was no limit for $1 coins. Thought it was funny and then poof, some guy comes in and pays $100 in $1 coins and the rest in vouchers. It wasn't really inconvenient but I had to close counter to count and recount and the people in my queue already running away to find another cashier quickly when they saw the coins. Took my own sweet time haha. The guy was worried for me and helped divide though so I was fine."
"Haha I googled that exact thing!! But he didn’t look like he hit 20 of any denomination cos the cashier informed him the amount was $12.xx and there were a few 50c and $1. I doubt he would actually care/she could be bothered to inform him tho.In hindsight I guess if the queues are never ending, a small break like that might have worked for the cashier :p"
Depends really. Worked as a cashier ages ago and personally i'd rather clear the customers a quickly as possible. Delays might mean flustered customers in the queue and eventually an unpleasant interaction.
Imagine if it was... Brunei coins!!!
"They are only obliged to accept up to $2 in 5 cent, 10 cent and 20 cent coins; and up to $10 in 50 cent or 1 dollar coins. SourceWhat you have stated on the legal tender limits for coins has been updated recently. The revised law has standardised the legal tender limits to 20 coins per denomination in a single transaction.Edit: Put it simply, when a transaction exceeds $37, the cashier can reject him if he wants to pay using only coins."
Thanks! TIL
Hey just noticed.. It's your 1st Cakeday ImpossibleAnger! hug
"Aww, thanks Cakeday Bot"
"Trust me, the pressure is more on the cashier"
some of financially tight.
"Looks like he got lucky at ""banluck"" over the CNY."
"There's new legislation recently that states the maximum amount of legal tender for coins. I can't remember what it was exactly, but honestly, who's gonna right?"
Pretty much solved with cashless payments lol
Apple Pay/Google Pay + Self-check out counter = Bliss 😁
i just go with cashless w self checkout these days. it’s just faster.
stupid sia....
Just curious to know as the numbers reported by certain medias seems inflated.
Someone posted about median salary just a day ago.
Reallyyy? Um do you mind linking the article?
https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/as7kez/median_salary_of_residents_before_employer_cpf_by/TLDR: $4k-$5.4k.
Depends on class honours also.. Esp for civil service
"Certainly it can be inflated. a lot depends on the nature of the degree (engineering, healhcare related, business etc).A lot also depends on whether the person is a foreigner or not.Just a rough take on what it can be so far, based on my personal experience and knowledge of my friends and acquaitances salary, all with 4-5 years experience:Friend - 1st class honours in engineering in defence-related R&F engineering=, after 5 years - $7K upwardsFriend - normal SIM degree (no honours) in business management, working in Civil service for more than 5 years - definitely $7K upwardsMalaysian Chinese PR with foreign degree in big local bank in sales - $7K - $8Klocal singaporean citizen with SIM degree in a big Mainland chinese bank- 5 years experience - $3K every month(before CPF)University of Madras, 1 year experience, in a IT complex for a big local bank - $5K upwards every month"

"Football: Tottenham announce first team's visit to Singapore and Shanghai in JulySINGAPORE - A Hurri-Kane is set to hit Singapore shores this summer as Tottenham Hotspur announced that their first team, headlined by England captain Harry Kane, will visit the Republic in July.While the 25-year-old striker is currently nursing an ankle injury, he could return at the end of the month to boost English Premier League title hopes for Tottenham who are currently third behind Manchester City and Liverpool but within striking distance.Other Spurs stars expected to feature prominently are France's World Cup-winning skipper and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, England midfielder Dele Alli and South Korean sensation Son Heung Min.Tottenham said in a statement on Tuesday (Feb 19): ""We are delighted to announce that the first team squad will travel to Singapore and Shanghai as part of our pre-season tour in July in preparation for the 2019/20 season.""The tour will also enable us to join in the Centennial celebrations of our Global Principal Partner, AIA, whose roots trace back to Shanghai in 1919.""Our tour to both Singapore and Shanghai will form an important part of the Pan-Asian life insurer's Centennial, with a 12-month programme of special events and activities across its 18 markets in the region having commenced in January.""The visit also affords the club the opportunity to engage with our millions of fans across Asia including Official Supporters Clubs in both countries in which we will be playing fixtures.""Related Story Tottenham still in title race: SonThe announcement virtually confirms Spurs will be one of the four teams competing in the International Champions Cup at the National Stadium in July.Last week, The Straits Times reported that English Premier League clubs Manchester United and Tottenham are all but confirmed for the visit and negotiations are ongoing to add Italy's Juventus and Inter Milan to the line-up.It is understood that the ICC is set to take place here over the July 19-21 weekend and will feature four teams - one more than in the last two years. But there will be just two games instead of the previous three.Although the fixtures will be confirmed only on March 27, the new arrangement means the four teams do not need to take a break between matches and the weekend scheduling should attract more fans to the National Stadium.While Spurs last visited Singapore in 1995, when they lost 4-2 to the Lions on penalties after a 1-1 draw in regulation, tours to Asia are not new to them. They were in Beijing for the 2009 Premier League Asia Trophy and Hong Kong for the 2013 edition. They also played in Malaysia in 2015, as well as Hong Kong in 2017.Spurs fan Fabius Chen, a 33-year-old public servant, said: ""I was there as a kid in 1995 and it was the first time I watched them in person. My favourite player at the time was Darren Anderton and I have never forgotten Singapore goalkeeper David Lee saving his spot-kick in the shootout.""I'll be there again in July because as a fan from Singapore, chances to see the team live are few and far between.""I hope manager Mauricio Pochettino and defender Toby Aiderweireld will still be at the club then. I'm also looking forward to seeing a few new faces that can hopefully take the team further next season, a couple of future stars like striker Troy Parrott, and definitely a better result than the last time they were here.""0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"
What would happen to the ofo bikes strewn around Singapore? Is there any way we could possibly purchase them for personal use? From what I know they’d be thrown to landfills anyways.
"Idk, some legends remove the lock, do a little tinkering, some spray paint and tada it’s totally not an ofo, it’s a bike they bought"
"Is there any actual legal repercussions for that? Because after Ofo dies, the bikes legally doesn’t belong to ofo as it no longer “exist” right? I don’t want to do such shady stuff and then after that it comes back and bites me in the arse."
"If Ofo falls into liquidation, the liquidators have control of their assets aka the bikes. If you do shady things, it's still theft."
Ooo thanks for that info!
It's still theft.
"Unfortunately, you need to wait for the liquidators to attempt to sell them. I've seen a job offer for someone to dismantle oBike bikes, it seems that they were sold for scrap value rather than there being an attempt to flood the second hand market, and I can see why. Too much of a niche market with the power assisted stuff around, even if you could technically buy one and experiment with a conversion kit."
That time Ofo did have a sale of some of their bikes ($50?)I hope they have it again. Some of their bikes are still good.
"Hopefully they do such sale again, since their bikes are better than ofo, though I wouldn’t keep my hopes up considering even their hq in China is pretty much dead"
Got one around my estate become support for plants and creepers. I swear they have some sort of magic which helps plants grow faster
Just buy a 2nd hand bike ffs...
"I think ofo will still be liable if lets say you bought it and discard it on the road some day in the future.So this is the hidden responsibility that society dont see, although i agree that it is a waste to throw the bikes away."
"when the video first started, I was wondering why they needed so many walls of mint plants.anyway, the amount of bare and empty rooftops around here always frustrates me, no solar, no urban farming nothing."
The problem is the amount it can hold... and output sadly...

"Might need more details on the plan,need more elaboration on “somewhere near Singapore Art Museum”"
well that's part of the secret (it's a dinner location)
It's deliberately done to prevent gatecrashing.

Aiyaa.. Its ok swee you guys around soon!
Guess he's not coming back then
"He already has UK citizenship through his father, he has no reason to return to Singapore. And to be honest ah.. did anyone really think he'd come back if he was granted deferment? Assuming that he succeeded as a professional footballer?2 years is huge in a footballer's career in terms of development and salary too."
"Let's be honest, he doesn't need to step into Singapore ever again. A UK passport is infinitely more useful in terms of job prospects, with a less competitive market in the UK. Its special relationship with the US and Canada will be more helpful in finding a job should he not pursue footballing anymore.Who knows, either he stays with Fulham or he can go to League 1/Scottish football too. No reason to be in Singapore."
Smart guy.
for good reason
We are never ever getting back together.
Even if he doesn't make it it would serve as an opportunity of a lifetime. Ns is overrated nowadays.Just old senile men in Parliament clawing at their last PAP straws.
Nationalism is the last refuge of the scoundrel politician.
can't blame them when it's so effective. look at how many idiots were enthusiastically raring to go to war when the malaysia dispute broke out. men in their 40s proclaiming they have their number 4 and field pack ready and waiting to be mobilised.
Probably when he made millions and no club wants him then he come back.Anyway no chance for him to come back Sg one not as if any notable Football club comes SG to play matches
He will be arrested and sent to jail the moment he enter singapore again.
Meanwhile Tony Tan's son got a 12 YEARS deferment to study then come back serve NS by studying soil. Lmao
"“The Enlistment Act is blind to 'personal convenience and considerations’, no matter how talented the individual or exceptional his circumstances,” Dr Ng said.Continuing on that theme, Dr Ng added deferment is granted to individuals very selectively, “if their deferment serves Singapore’s interest first and foremost, never their own”."
also Singapore government: wHy DoN't SiNgApOrEaNs IdEnTiFy WiTh ThEiR cOuNtRy
"I foresee next month’s ST headlines: Millennials are destroying many industries, including National Service"
"I have nothing against Tony Tan's son getting his super long deferment if the soil studying actually produces results. There should be pressure on him to prove that that work was worth granting such special treatment. I feel that Singapore missed an additional opportunity here - Ben Davis could have been granted 12 years as well, to come back and serve his time as a national coach maybe (at NSF rates of course). Win-win all around. And if he does not make it, he's just another guy lah. No need to be salty about it. Instead, if his career does take off, we can't claim any credit here since he has to break the law to reach success."
Hahahah what a fucking joke.
Has this guy ever explained how the soil bacteria research is in Singapore’s interest first and foremost?
"The case is a bit more complicated than that, and it was addressed in a parliamentary reply in 2011:https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/email/link/?id=008_20111020_S0007_T0005&fullContentFlag=falseBasically:NSFs are routinely granted disruption to study medicine because army needs doctors.Most people study medicine in Singapore/UK/Australia, which is a typical four-year undergrad degree. But Patrick Tan wanted to study in the US.In the US, you study for a medical degree and get your MD after completing four years of undergrad.Patrick Tan chose a medical degree that was combined with a PhD degree.In total, his disruption was 4 years of pre-med undergrad at Harvard + 8 years of MD-PhD studies at Stanford.Supposedly two other people have also been granted such lengthy case-by-case disruption on a similar basis.To me the case isn't clearly resolved, and it centers on that four years of pre-med undergrad. Taking a pre-med undergrad does not guarantee you any sort of place in a medical school. When MINDEF allowed him to disrupt his NS, I don't think they could know for sure that he would eventually make it to medical school in America."
Ya and his NS basically allows him to boost his CV tooMeanwhile I am a rifleman running around trees screaming “CONTACTED!!!”
"If they can assume Patrick will become a doctor and come back to serve after 12 years, can't they assume Ben Davies will become a Fulham first teamer and come back to play for Singapore as well?"
"Yes.At that time, melioidosis (also known as “soil disease”) was a serious concern to MINDEF as it had been affecting soldiers in the field and is a potential bio-terrorism threat (see below for more details). I was attached to what is now the Defence Medical and Environmental Research Institute (DMERI, then called DMRI) to research Burkholderia pseudomallei, the bacterium that causes melioidosis. This research involved an organism called C. elegans, which had been the subject of my PhD thesis. I also led a team to establish one of the first DNA microarray facilities in Singapore,  allowing us to analyze melioidosis genetic variation with unprecedented speed, resolution, and scale. As a result of this work, DMERI and Singapore is now regarded as a major global center of melioidosis research, which has facilitated interactions with numerous international universities and defence institutes.Melioidosis is a serious, often fatal infectious disease of human and animals caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseuodmallei (Bp). Bp is found in South East Asian soils including Singapore, and Bp has also been officially designated a potential biowarfare agent by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), similar to anthrax. In Singapore, meliodosis cases are not uncommon, and in a 2004 outbreak 15 people died from the disease. Within the SAF, meliodosis has also occurred in otherwise healthy National Servicemen, in some cases resulting in death. For these reasons, a research program was initiated by DMRI in the 1990s to study Bp and how it causes melioidosis."
Wow thanks Patrick!
"So how many soldiers suffered from meliodosis again?Why the 12 year wait, this is was so important that Patrick was planned ahead 12 years to do this soil research? Were there no soil scientists they could have hired before Patrick was ready?"
"The 12 year wait was not for him to craft some elaborate plan on studying soils. He had a disruption of 12 years to his National Service because he was on the President’s scholarship and took a longer University route in studying medicine + PhD.Sure, there could have been ‘soil scientists’ available for hire, but on the other hand you have an NSman on NSman salary, equipped with expertise from his university field of study. Organisational requirements and common sense would lend MINDEF towards deploying him in a vocation where his knowledge and skills could be applied.It is also important to note that in the case of Patrick Tan it was a disruption - and not deferment - of National Service, meaning he completed his BMT obligations first before being granted a postponement of his NS duties in order to further his studies. PSC scholars are granted this as they are groomed for public service and are obliged to carry out bonds for government agencies post-graduation. These are tangible and certain contributions to national interests. I’m wishing for Ben Davis’ success as much as anyone, but signing a professional contract for a youth team is simply not substantial enough to justify deferment."
"i thank you for ur counter-argument, gives me a clear sense of why patrick was granted such a long disruption. i do however disagree with ben davies not being granted deferment."
"That argument doesn't fly for me. If there is no elaborate plan for Patrick to become a soil scientist, how is he granted deferment for 12 years to study an overseas degree? How would they know it is in Singapore's best interests and not Patrick's best interest?If there is no plan, they wouldn't know how he could contribute can they?Unless you are saying that it is for certain they Patrick will have better skills after getting an ordinary degree, but you can make the same argument for every other soldier too can't you?"
"As I said, PSC scholars are groomed for public service and are obliged to serve 6 years of bond with government agencies. Meaning they must serve national interests first through public service instead of being given the option to pursue a career in the private sector. These scholars are also identified as being among the most promising elite that are capable of contributing greatly to the public sector. That’s how they know, to a reasonable certainty, that scholars such as Patrick can and will contribute to the country - the same can’t be guaranteed for every other soldier.You can make the case that serving the public sector and boosting Patrick’s CV are not mutually exclusive (ie they overlap). It may be in Patrick’s best interests as well to serve NS after taking his degree, but more importantly it is also in the nation’s interests. That’s how scholarships work - there are often benefits for both parties."
He was then designated to a scientific research department which was shut down soon after that. I wonder how many other NSFs made it to that department.
Ya what is this NSF research role. Never knew got such thing.
Mindef creates one for you when there is none
Keywords:Tony Tan
He did came up with the Rice Bucket as an apology tho
Then now make the bucket small but give 2 tendies...

"Its Colonel Sanders for Christ sake, cut him some slack. /s"
"Disruption*. He served BMT and part of his OCS before leaving for his studies. But then again, still pretty unfair if you ask me."
"Woah, he disrupted OCS? Damn, soil must be very important for that rule to be broken."
"At that time, melioidosis (also known as “soil disease”) was a serious concern to MINDEF as it had been affecting soldiers in the field and is a potential bio-terrorism threat (see below for more details).

Our DMERI research team published peer-reviewed papers in established scientific journals (see references below).Apparently it was a legitimate problem at that time. But the question then is why they can't assign existing scientists research tasks on soil disease lol."
Cheap Slave labour.
/NS
"""This research involved an organism called C. elegans, which had been the subject of my PhD thesis."" The more specific and niche the area of study, the harder it is to find subject matter experts qualified enough to do it."
Lots of SAF scholars disrupt their OCC to attend universities overseas.
How is this justified anyway?
"If they're SAF scholars doesn't it mean they'll have an employment bond? In which case if they're serving the same amount of time, then it'd be better to have someone serve as a Uni grad than as a pre-U student."
"Because SAF scholars sign bonds, just like every other scholarship in-exchange for subsidized education and allowance. SAF specific scholarships sends you to courses which benefits SAF no matter what vocation you get transferred to, engineers become system technical officers/managers/engineers for SAF equipments such as our SAR-21, combat vehicles, support vehicles, etc. That's just SAF scholars choosing Engineering related courses, there's others as well. Have you not heard of NTU-SAF academy? Let's not talk about serving, all the comments you've made thus far sound like you've either never got past Secondary school to know how scholarships nor anything works, or you're ultra sheltered."
"Holy shit, I remember seeing posters about this in most army camps I visited while serving NS"
Ben Davies will be pretty happy to serve BMT and then get a 12 year deferment I believe.
That is why 投对胎 (reincarnation) is important
"tsk tsk, why sg also liddat oneread a little about it, not sure reliable or not lah but scholars usually can get deferments alsobut only Tony Tan's son get a freaking 12 year siasource: http://theindependent.sg/when-ex-president-tony-tans-son-deferred-national-service-for-12-years/edit: one more other person has gotten it before*"
"Downvoted for misrepresenting what your source says. According to your source, it's not only Patrick Tan who got 12 years:While some NSFs are granted deferments to pursue an education in medicine, only one other has received a deferment as long as Tan’s son, Patrick.If you're going to cite sources, don't be misleading about what the source says.For completeness, I will add thatIt's the Independent (which sometimes has a loose relationship with truth) andFor those curious, the source for one other person can be found in this parliamentary speech, which states that three people applied for and were granted disruption for medical studies in the US. (I do wish we had more context for this - in the 1980s, how many families in Singapore had the funding to send their children to US for medical studies, as opposed to UK/Ireland/Australia - the latter being presumably much cheaper, faster, and closer to Singapore. This could help explain why more people went to UK/Ireland/Australia as compared to US.)"
"He served BMT first. As long as you serve some parts of NS first, still can discuss"
"Usually only those left a few months, but need to start uni one."

Lol. Hopefully he becomes a major league player one day and the government can’t do anything but watch him casually flex on them. I don’t mind seeing that happening.
Then you’ll see this for 2 weeks straight.StraitsTimes:First Singaporean football player to top EPL.
Him defaulting probably means he is renouncing singapore citizenship though. Plus he was born in Thailand.The guy came here at 9 and left for overseas studies at 15. Its a joke for us to claim him.
What happens if he ends up on the thai national team and they have to play in Singapore? Would look pretty shitty for sg if they arrest an opposing player.
Actually curious about this.. what would happen?
"I vaguely remember something about athletes having diplomatic immunity for past crimes. Maybe that was just the Olympics because of the whole peace thing that trumped a world war. Or it could have been just someone ranting about how things should be. When I say vague, I mean vague"
"Consider Russia was threatening to arrest athletes for being gay, I don't think that applies any more."
"IIRC, unless you're caught in the act doing something REALLY stupid(cough ""The Biebs pissing into a mop bucket""/""pissing off the local authorities"" stupid cough cough), sportsman are given technical ""diplomatic immunity"" as a show of international cooperation(might just be for the Olympics, so I may be wrong here).Technically, we can't arrest him for escaping NS if he's here as a sports representative, but IF he gets himself into legal hot water(verbally/physically assaulting a public servant, arrested while doing drugs, man slaughter(touch wood, touch wood), drink driving, etc. y'know, the usual ""dumb shit""), the police can arrest him for THAT, but can't have the NS act law slapped onto him.(it's been a while, and I might be wrong. Do NOT quote me on this)In a way, the only way we can charge him for willfully defaulting on his NS obligations, is if he's sent back by the club(let go), or is dumb enough to forget that he's technically a criminal, and comes back normally through the airport. The latter looks to be highly unlikely(unlike with a *turns head CERTAIN DUMBASS cough a certain Amos cough cough), and only time will tell with the former.P.S. can an actual lawyer correct me on this? Thanks in advance."
What if he's in a plane and something happens and the plane makes an emergency landing in SG?
He will be arrested
"We can always arrest a fugitive, there is no diplomatic immunity for sportsmen."
"Most likely the Thai team would just let him stay home and rest, better to be safe than sorry. Similar to what the Knicks did with Kanter."
"I always laugh when someone says that he owes Singapore since we used resources while he grew up here. He was here for only about 6 years plus if I remember correctly he went to an international high school while in sg. We hardly did anything for himWhat's the point of making him stay anyway. He obviously wants to move away from Singapore after NS to fullfil his own dreams, may as well just let him go off now. It feels more like Singapore plan was to take the 2 years and try to convince him to stay in sg to representor to take away this opportunity away from him now and hope another one doesn't come knocking so he won't leave"
"We hardly did anything for himHis family probably paid more in to SG than SG gave them in services, since they're not exactly poor. It's probably fair to just call it even."
"Only people benefiting from Singapore education system are Singaporeans, and that's only in terms of monetary value. Pretty sure international students and PR pay insane amounts and struggle if they aren't from well to do families, I had to apply Financial Assistance for one of my man who was PR when I was still PC because he paid 4-5k per sem with bond when he was in Poly. The family struggled hard and his dad was no longer around by the time he graduated."
"Hasn't stop Singapore from claiming Vanessa Mae and other Singapore born famous talented people.Just use the words ""Singapore born"" instead of Singaporean."
He was not born in singapore either.
'He grew up in Singapore.'
"The media circus played up Kevin Kwan's heritage for months during the Crazy Rich Asians run, and his connection to this country isn't that much more than Davis'."
Maybe thaliand should grant him diplomatic immunity for sg only.
"Thailand can’t grant him diplomatic immunity. We decide if he gets it, but Singapore would likely not give it to him and it is unlikely Thailand will request diplomatic immunity for a mere Soccer player"
Media + politicians would probably still grasp at straws by claiming he had formative childhood years in Singapore or something
Ugh..
People will remind each other that Singapore wanted to crush his future.
I think he has a lot of motivation to succeed now.
Unlikely. An average at best footballer in his age group right now.
"Average is a relative term.Average in one of the top leagues in the world, is pretty damn good."
"Unfortunately to play in a Top 5 European league, pretty damn good is far from good enough.From an article:The statistics are really sobering. Out of all the boys who enter an academy at the age of 9, less than half of 1% make it. Or a make a living from the game either.The most damning statistic of all is only 180 of the 1.5 million players who are playing organised youth football in England at any one time will make it as a Premier League pro."
He's well past the 1.5m youth cohort though. Everyone and their dog gets a trial in the UK.
"Well past that perhaps, but odds are still not good. It's hard to find exact numbers (I've been trying to find good numbers out of personal interest, but I guess in the first place these numbers aren't recorded nationally anywhere), but from this BBC report:""Of those entering the game aged 16, two years down the line, 50% will be outside professional football. If we look at the same cohort at 21, the attrition rate is 75% or above.The key term being outside professional football, not just outside the Premier League."
"Nah you are of course right that playing at the highest levels of competition requires a lot of skill hardwork and probably lots of luck.I'm just saying ""average"" here is an unclear term with no real meaning. Tbh by virtue of just being able to avoid NS like this, he's already exceptional.But to pick up from your point though, I feel like it says a lot about our national risk appetite or ability to aspire if our line of thinking (not directing this to you personally) is along the lines of ""low Chances of success, therefore might as well don't try, he should have stayed for NS""."
"I hope as well that Ben Davis succeeds in England. But he's simply not that good. It's beyond a ""low chance of success"".Hariss Harun is without doubt the generational talent of the 2000s for the Singapore national team (broke all records for youngest player, went to Barcelona to train (at a youth training camp only) and got the MVP award), and he couldn't even make it to the Chinese Super League.The odds are seriously stacked against Ben Davis, and if he wanted to be a professional footballer, it would have made more sense for him to come back, serve NS and play in the S-League and for the Singapore national team (or in the Thai league and for the Thai national team)Him trying his luck in England is really for his own benefit only."
"The odds are seriously stacked against Ben Davis, and if he wanted to be a professional footballer, it would have made more sense for him to come back, serve NS and play in the S-League and for the Singapore national team (or in the Thai league and for the Thai national team)Lets be honest, there is no future in playing in the S-league especially with his family background. Bad crowds,atmosphere,interest etc. There is a reason players always go overseas, to play/train more competitively."
"Thai league, then, since with his multi-nationality heritage he has these different options available to him."
"The odds are seriously stacked against Ben Davis, and if he wanted to be a professional footballer, it would have made more sense for him to come back, serve NS and play in the S-League and for the Singapore national team (or in the Thai league and for the Thai national team)You have to be kidding right? A journeyman in League One and Two will still earn more than most S-League players (£40k-50k annually before bonuses and taxes)."
"Salary-wise he'll make a lot more in Singapore after taxes, and he will probably have much higher chances of success - I don't think the standard in League One or League Two should be underestimated. I bring up Hariss as I'm benchmarking what has happened to literally the best player in Singapore in the last 20 years vs someone with potential who hasn't been called up to the National team (he's still young, but Hariss was even younger)Again I'd like to emphasise that Ben Davis as every right to pursue his dreams and I'm glad he did. I also don't think that MINDEF should bend over to help him do so. In the end, this situation works out best for everyone."
"To play on your original point, success is a relative term as well.At this point, making it to U18 squad of Fulham does count as something. I hope he does well, as a football fan myself, I recognize that these type of contract may not eventually amount to much and he could just be released by the club.To be fair, not everyone gets a shot at it and if it comes along, I would imagine why the family took this route. But I also have to agree with MINDEF, the real benefit to Singapore (the point of contention for giving exemption) at this point remains vague and difficult to justify."
"forgive me if i am wrong. i thought he got in because his dad has is some managing director of a soccer club, and thus have connections"
"Ben Davis is the Club’s first scholar to hail from Singapore. His family is based in Harrow and he was spotted in a scouting mission at an international tournament in Singapore which also revealed hisBritish heritage.Davis made 10 appearances for the Young Whites in midfield in his first season at the Club. He had a pass accuracy of 90%, and scored a storming header away at West Ham United to put Fulham briefly ahead. He made 13 tackles in his 10 matches and 16 interceptions.Scouted, connections just means the scout watches if you are good enough,Okay for the u-18, not tested yet for higher levels.https://www.fulhamfc.com/player-profiles/ben-davis"
Football is a brutally honest sport. Either you got it or you don't and it will show on the pitch.His father's connections (probably to get him on Fulham's scholarship program or get the scouts to have a look at his son) can only take him so far.
"Chill, he's not even that good. Daddy's boy who's had strings pulled for him."
Yes they be the first few to claim credit and will find some ways to tax his income
"Given that Israel also makes everyone enlist into the army, I wonder how they tackle deferments and stuff.Honestly I also wonder why the government didn't enlist girls too, the girls in the IDF look like they're doing fine."
"Old school sexism is ripe with the old folks. It's part they don't think women are capable, part ""men should protect women."""

"As Long as he doesn’t step back in SG he’s okay right? Good for him la, go chase his dreams.I may not be talented at any sports and never had intention to “leave” Singapore, however I did apply for deferment to finish my degree overseas before coming back for NS. I was miraculously granted 3 years deferment and after I served my NS I had to choose one of my dual citizenships. I had my reasons for choosing Singapore, but it’s crazy to think that I could have chosen to be a defaulter and stay in the UK."
What r ur reasons? Just curious
"I come from a working class background. Immigrated to UK when I was young with my family as my dad is British.Singapore provides better career opportunities than the UK (in my personal opinion) and I have family/friends in Singapore. Didn’t like the idea of being labeled as a wanted criminal for life. Also prefer the food and weather in Singapore, maybe the thought of never eating prata again solidified my choice haha"
Woah wait what. U like the sg weather???
"Lol ikr, I have skin issues so Singapore’s heat and humidity has actually been very helpful, as opposed to the dry colder weather in the UK.The grass is ALWAYS greener on the other side guys :)People always ask me why I didn’t stay in the UK, they’ll say things like “Wah but always got aircon” “fish and chips so nice” and lots of other stereotypical comments.Living in a country and visiting for a holiday are two very different things.The UK isn’t some shining western wonderland. Crime and danger exist, people can be shitty (like racial targeting/hooliganism both of which I have actively experienced), unemployment is rife, healthcare is “free” but be prepared to wait 6-8months for a consultation if your issue is not serious. Public transport is bad, food is awful, Nothing is open after 6pm expect restaurants and the job market is even worse.There are around 130 universities in the UK, all of them pump out students with new degree every year, EG, thousands of people get a psychology degree (not hating on psych lol) and most of them never actually put their degree to use.Of course there are many things about the UK which are good, but Singapore just suits my character and future goals better."
"People always ask me why I didn’t stay in the UK, they’ll say things like “Wah but always got aircon” “fish and chips so nice” and lots of other stereotypical comments.Hahahaha typical Sinkie comments sia this one 😂😂😂"
Wouldnt his dad become an instigator in this case?

"10 years later, our media and ministers will shamelessly brag about the ""Singaporean connection"" when Ben is playing in the Champions League or something."
"Given his woefully average stats within an already laughable talent pool, the odds are highly likely that he won’t even make the first team in a club that may be relegated from EPL soon."
"While that is the likelihood, I would like to point out there are late bloomers in the game such as Jamie Vardy, who at age 25 was playing in the English conference league (equivalent to 5th division) and earning less than the average Singapore league player. For the uninitiated, he went on to win the Premier League with Leicester City, breaking several Premier League scoring records along the way. Also represented England at the World Cup and is earning upwards 5 million sterling pounds a year."
"Forget about the premier league, even getting into the championship or league one is already a big achievement."
"Daniel Bennett did play in the English Div 2 way back, opted to come back to play in the S League (Wrexham wanted him). Safuwan Baharudin apparently has the calibre to play in the Australian league but opted to play in the M League (Melbourne City wanted him). Fandi Ahmad had the calibre to play in top European leagues but also opted to play in M League (Ajax Amsterdam wanted him).Our talented players have no ambition, happy to take a good pay and play in their comfort zones."
"Of course. Good pay, be a big fish in a small pond, build a nice local reputation which will serve you well post retirement career"
"I think playing a few years in a better league will put you in a better bargaining position for post retirement. Also, instead of mixing with players and coaches with top level credentials in Europe, Fandi was exposed to Malaysian league standard management and tactics. Maybe that is why he is not the best coach. And don't get me started on Sundram. How one coach can go an entire year without a win with the national team is mind boggling. But nevermind la, all friend friend top to bottom."
"This is grossly incorrect... Daniel Bennett was playing in League Two, actually the fourth tier of English pro football. Note that he knew about the foreign talent scheme at that time, and was very likely eyeing citizenship.Also, Safuwan was indeed targeted as a permanent signing by Melbourne City during his 3 month stint, but eventually it was the club who didn't want him, not the other way around. Safuwan had to take up a foreign player slot, so the club could have felt like it was better to use it for other players of better calibre. He was also injured at the point of his loan expiry, so there's that. He only chose to play in the M League because of all the benefits the Malaysian sides offered.A few examples would be a personal car, house, and a huge paycheck. Rather than a lack of ambition, these players are just trying to earn enough money during this short career. One very good example of this would be Hariss Harun, playing for Johor Darul Takzim. He turned down an offer to play in Portugal, but ended up playing for the best team in Malaysia.The amount of money he's paid to play football is quite crazy, so I don't think there's much wrong with that. Having to adapt to a brand new environment and bring about the risk of possibly not earning enough money... Most local footballers will pick the same path as both Hariss and Safuwan."
"""won't even make an epl team"" - its the best league in the world... im saying league overall in terms of competitiveness. youd make a lot of money at a first div team let alone championship or premiership."
MFW redditors describe actual professional team sport athletes IRL with ‘woefully average stats’.
almost like they’re FIFA players huh
"I mean, if you want to make a decent full-time living off of it..."
The clerk must have been snickering as he was processing it
"Is to tell him Mindef love him deep deep, and hoping that he'll stay for us if he loves Singapore."
"Not granted deferment bcos he tried to pursue a cause not beneficial to Singapore? I find it rly disappointing the Singapore government is unable to see the full picture of the benefits granting his deferment may bring.Going beyond “doing nothing for the Singapore football scene”, which honestly I find to be a dumb reason anyway cos any footballer with a functional brain would know pursuing football in Singapore only leads to a dead end (which basically means the government is telling u to fk your career up. no nego.), thr are other beneficial aspects granting Davis’s deferment may bring.Right off the bat, thr’s the Singaporean pride. Govt like to talk about this so much right? Wah piang suddenly when it comes to Davis they completely forget about it liao. Or maybe they lack the empathy to understand how pride is derived. U think we gain pride from seeing the Singapore football team win a few matches against our neighbours? Lol no pls no one gives a shit about the Singaporean football scene. Seeing a Singaporean on the big stage tho? Imagine when he scores a goal at the english league. Holy shit, different story. Ppl from all countries will talk about it. Singapore is finally noticed on a global stage. We’d all go on twitter & instagram talking bout how Singapore finally got hope at making it big in football liao. “Improving the Singapore football scene” shouldnt be limited to playing football for the Singapore team. Tht’s near sighted as hell and honestly no one gives a damn about tht.Next, inspiring out youths. As a young adult myself, something ive had issues with the Singapore education system growing up was how linear it was. Thr’s too much to lose if you stray away from it. But Davis? It’s inspiring to see him pursue his dreams. Tht’s entrepreneurial spirit right there, to pursue a different path, create something for yourself. Im sure seeing the Singapore government shut him down from pursuing his dreams outrightly shuts many youths’ dreams down as well, and I find it really unfortunate the Singapore government is unable to see this consequence. Yes they may say you can pursue what you want after serving NS, but the reality of today is that 18 years old is the golden period when most risk can be taken. 2 years is a lot of time when you’re still young, it shouldn’t be shortchanged as years that are insignificant. And furthermore, for careers such as sports, it’s only normal to start at a young age.For those who aren’t avid sports fans and want something leaning more to arts/music, then something i can think of is the kpop scene. Thr’s this recent debut show for a new kpop boy group called Treasure Box. The youngest member set to debut is 14, and the oldest is 19. Imagine having a Singaporean in a kpop grp making it big? In the government’s eyes, that doesn’t do much for Singapore right? It’s not part of a Singaporean band, doesn’t help bring in much revenue for Singapore (unless a concert is held here) etc. But think about it in the eyes of an everyday Singaporean. Imagine the representation we’d get at a global scale, and how much pride it’d give us. In industries such as this, it clearly shows that if youths don’t defer from NS, they’d be too old to pursue such dreams, or at least be put at a heavy disadvantage pursuing them, and again, I find it disappointing the government is unable to see such consequences.These are just my 2 cents on this topic. Im honestly rather disappointed with the government for being so near sighted with their decision, downplaying “benefitting Singapore” to such a straightforward, statistical value.Would love to see more inputs on this tho, pls tell me what you think!"
"Good job dude. Soar or crash and burn. It's your choice and none can take it away from you. Even if you fail, just know that by taking this step, you have already surpassed the majority of Singaporeans. Nobody ever had a dream 'round here. The system tried to crush yours, but you took a stand."

Soar or crash and burn.Also a good idea within NS in general. Aim for the top or the bottom. Ben Davis took it one step further and dug a hole below the bottom.
"well guess this did not come as a surprise, I now somewhat really doubt his father's rhetoric about how he's really patriotic, wants to serve Singapore, etc."
"I now somewhat really doubt his father's rhetoric about how he's really patriotic, wants to serve Singapore, etc.Was it even believable to begin with? Not many would be patriotic about a country that forces you to serve in the military without the flexibility to do so at a later age. Since you're not allowed to finish your personal business before your serve, the country is basically compelling you to put your country above yourself."
"""Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country""how about no. Offer a symbiotic relationship or I'm leaving. You can't even be bothered to train me for another ship so I can't play with guns anymore."
Yeah I honestly dk what is with that old fashioned thinking that everyone must feel obligated to serve
Even South Korea which have a legitimate threat and need for conscription allow for more leeway than Singapore.
Good for him. Hope he succeeds.

He has my full support.Edit: Life is way too short and pass too fast.
"imo because there is never a right answer on moral questions, i side the govt. also yes hello downvotes.all of the 3 who has been given the pass have plans to help singapore earn things. like directly benefit SG.when asked repeatly what he wanna do to help back singapore, the dude did not say any plans at all. not even the simplest thing of coming back to teach as a coach.yes yes, if he succeed, will give reputation to singapore. but he is playing for an english team, not singapore leh. isnt this personal career goals already? where got fight for sg? i dont see the link between his own reputation and the benefits it can being to singapore's reputation bah. is it fair for other NSman who also want to pursue their career?the father also v demanding tbh, say if cannot they just leave SG. ig they can just leave lah.when being asked a few other questions like when he will come back and serve, no response also.idk lahEdit: TIL a lot of things, thanks"
"As a football fan, if he identifies himself as a Singaporean, then I see him representing us on the pitch. No Singaporean has ever played in the Premier League or its equivalent. Or any other sport of its equivalent for that matter. If everything needs to be so black and white then football in Singapore will never evolve. National sport my ass."
What makes you think he don't want to? Singapore football ranking is too low for him to be allowed to be play there so he use his English citizenship by descent to play.
He doesnt need to renounce his citizenship or identify as a English citizen. He has already received a scholarship and is in Fulham's academy. His father is a British citizen making it relatively easier to obtain a visa anyways if he havent got one.
"There's been a lot of misinformation on this, particularly by the rhetoric spouted by the G. In English football, in order for a player outside of the EU to obtain a work permit, they need to come from countries with a certain FIFA ranking. If he went to England as a Singaporean, he wouldn't get one because of Singapore's ranking. But as a British, he wouldn't need a work permit. Even the media aren't picking up on this and keep harping on the point that his nationality is listed as British on the website.Case in point, when Liverpool's U16 side came to play against SG's U16 side, the Liverpool coach admitted he might be interested in Ikhsan Fandi (who hit a hattrick against them), but couldn't do anything because of our ranking."
"is it fair for other NSman who also want to pursue their career?Have you considered that some people don't want to drag others' careers down just to feel good and maintain an illusion of fairness?I'm in NS, perfectly fine with him leaving.Edit: reminds me of this comment on how utlimatums that make you choose between the relationship and your life are abusiveEdit2: So I have Reddit Silver which only matters for the two days when I book out lol"
"i think letting him defer his NS would give future aspiring sportspeople hope that they wouldn't have to trade off between their athletic career and their citizenship.if he doesn't come back and serve on the agreed date, there's no harm in charging him then but denying it completely is a bit shortsighted i feel."
when applying he failed to provide a date as to when he can come back but yes nice
"What does ""directly benefit Singapore"" mean, though? Benefit who? Benefit in what way?As others said, he can benefit Singapore by raising its profile in international football at the club level. He could also benefit Singaporeans (as opposed to ""Singapore"") by encouraging youngsters who want to excel at sports.The policy of ""no exceptions to NS"" has a lot of valid points in its favour, but having to bend over backwards to explain why people who want exceptions don't ""benefit Singapore"" muddies the waters by disrespecting a lot of very valid careers."
"By right, ""obligation to serve NS"" and ""duty to defend Singapore"" by left it's about following your dreams."
"As they are both matured adults or soon to be, I'm sure they gave a lot of thought to this matter, and are fully aware of the consequences. Should they choose to continue walking down that path, we should respect their decision. Not saying that I fully recommend everyone from defaulting. If the time comes and you have two choices that might affect your future career, only then we would truly understand them."
"mhm, they should do whats best for thembut at the same time, it feels like they didnt quite reach both goalsa good reputationsingapore passport"
"regardless of the Government's actions, If given the similar opportunities I think many would do the same as he did however.Imagine being offered this opportunity, you could take it or say ""No I'm not good enough to do what I love doing, what is my passion and what gives Joy in life. I should just give up"" to yourself. If I gave up my passions like that, just to serve NS I think I would have gone through with some dark thoughts I had holding that SAR-21 at 2am Guard duty shift."
"ikr, but they really could have approached it better lahbut i believe most of us who just default as well"
"Of similar view, although it's not a popular opinion. I don't think MINDEF should grant him a pass. Don't think he should expect to enjoy the benefits of citizenship without the obligations. He clearly has no intention to serve Singapore, just wanna serve his own needs.I admire his drive to pursue his dreams, however. Hope he does well!"
omg these were the words my incompetent english self was looking forDon't think he should expect to enjoy the benefits of citizenship without the obligations.bless you
"His father might just be honest.Mindef wanted him to give a date. If his son has better opportunities in future, he would want to defer again.It is not made clear whether mindef said they wanted a definite date, or estimated date and would consider his future deferment applications.And Singapore benefits directly if he really makes it big. Singapore will be famous for being the bigger man who values talent."
"Not sure if mindef had much choice in this matter. Heard the father was trying to game the system by not committing to play for Singapore. If Ben had indeed played for Singapore, he would lose the possibility of playing for England, meaning that he will not get a slot in Fulham's U18 team. The chances of getting a slot is much higher since he used his English citizenship.In my opinion, he never really wanted his Singapore citizenship, so since he can throw away the Singapore citizenship, which he has full rights to do so, the country also has full rights to throw the book at him."
"Full respect to both our govt for holding their ground, and to Ben Davis for having the balls (pun intended) to decide what's best for his life and career.As much as I, as an avid fan of our national football team, am somewhat disgusted with our government for not granting the deferment, I'm fine with that as long as they understand there's no backsies if he actually does well in his footballing career. If the government actually finds a way to bring him back to our national team after he has proven his worth as a footballer without actually going through with the deferment punishments THEN I will be actually disgusted."
"Footballer Ben Davis has defaulted on NS obligations: MINDEFSINGAPORE: Local footballer Benjamin Davis has defaulted on his National Service (NS) obligations, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said on Monday (Feb 18).“Mr Benjamin Davis is a National Service (NS) defaulter,"" said MINDEF in response to Channel NewsAsia's queries. ""He failed to report for NS as required. He is also staying overseas without a valid Exit Permit. Mr Davis has committed offences under the Enlistment Act, and is liable upon conviction to a fine of up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to 3 years.”AdvertisementDavis, 18, signed a two-year contract with newly promoted English Premier League (EPL) side Fulham, the club announced in July last year. He is the first Singaporean to sign a professional contract with a top-tier English club. The former Singapore Sports School student had joined Fulham on a two-year scholarship deal in July 2017.His application to defer his national service (NS) enlistment was rejected by MINDEF, who said he did not “meet the criteria for long-term deferment from full-time NS"".AdvertisementAdvertisement""As all male Singaporeans liable for full-time NS put aside personal pursuits to dutifully enlist and serve their NS, it would not be fair to approve applications for deferment for individuals to pursue their own careers and development,” MINDEF had said in a statement.""Very few applications have been approved over the years and based on criteria which are made known to the public. In sports, deferments are granted only to those who represent Singapore in international competitions like the Olympic Games and are potential medal winners for Singapore. In the last 15 years, only three have met this criteria.”In response, his father, Mr Harvey Davis, said a deferment would have allowed his son to pursue his dream of playing in the EPL and “make Singapore proud by being the first Singaporean to play in the EPL”.Speaking in Parliament in August last year, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen had stressed that NS obligations are “crucial to our nation’s survival”, as he referred to a 2017 written judgement by the Appellate High Court during an appeal on the sentencing of NS defaulters.The judges said that every male Singaporean must serve NS at the time he is required to under the Enlistment Act, “without regard to his personal convenience and considerations”.“The Enlistment Act is blind to 'personal convenience and considerations’, no matter how talented the individual or exceptional his circumstances,” Dr Ng said.Continuing on that theme, Dr Ng added deferment is granted to individuals very selectively, “if their deferment serves Singapore’s interest first and foremost, never their own”.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"
Good bot
"2 years is a long time, can lose touch and ability. And thus why Singapore football will never reach European level. Good for him in pursuing his dreams."
TENS OF people.I lol'ed
He’s not joking.Go tpy stadium and watch a game.Fking joke.
"Wah lao, sinkie must prawn sinkie then can sleep ar?This guy has the opportunity of a lifetime and you must be crazy to think that he will give it up.Singapore want to work on pulling up our sport image but yet constantly pull this shit. This kid is achieving something that most of us can't and he even ask for deferment.He try to do things the right way but mindef die also want to be in the old mindset? How is SINGAPORE sport scene supposed to improved if we constantly cut down talents?"
Just wait till he scores some important goal to secure some championship or smt.SINGAPOREAN footballer scores important goal
I have reliable information that he has decent potential.
Must inform FM to update under Cons wanted by Singapore government.
Damn son
Ok what. He good life. Go there skip ns be amdk. Is there even a downside to him not coming back?
Cannot eat cai png
Priorities.
"I'd haul ass out of Singapore, default NS too if I could and was given the opportunity to pursue my dreams.Hell this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Hope he makes it big and flex at our gov 😎"
Singapore : Successful Version of North Korea. Fuck Lee
Seriously hope he becomes a legit premier league or championship caliber footballer.
I love for that to happen. I'd love for more people to follow him too and become successful. And show just how damaging NS really is to the future prospects of our boys.
"What action can SG take? Declaring that he is now a criminal is all the govt can do, since SG never requests extradition for NS defaultees who flee overseas. Davies will only be arrested if he ever returns to SG"
So be it. I served my 2 years but I’m not losing any sleep over this.
"Seriously fuck people who think like that. Guy wasn't even born here, only stopped over here for studies and for that he HAS to serve? This country has nothing for him.And as this example of people going ""I had a horrible and wasteful 2 years so everyone else should!"" instead of ""NOONE should ever have to waste 2 years"" goes to show, this country and it's people do not deserve him bringing pride to it.I want him to succeed just to rub it in their noses. I want it so bad.GO BEN, I'M ROOTING FOR YOU, NOT AS A SINGAPOREAN BUT A FELLOW DREAM CHASER"
"Tbh, I’m one of those minorities who feel that it’s only fair if he got defaulted. Also, I don’t give a damn about the football scene in SG as well. So it’s only fair if he has to serve NS like everyone else and face consequences if he doesn’t. Just my personal opinion though."
"Oh well, It's a once in a lifetime opportunity after all, can't blame him"
"Well done lad!If/when he does make it, I can’t wait to see how the media/govt will claim him."
Hero. Hopes he becomes a premier league starter then a full England or Thai national
"support him in pursuing his dreams and dare to stand up to the authority, this guy got bigger balls than many of us"
Been growing my hair out but haven't decided how I want it to be cut yet. Would like to hear what you guys usually have in mind.

"Hey, I'm thinking of getting a 2 block haircut too to solve the problem of my hair standing up stubbornly. But I'm still undecided cause I'm not sure if I will be comfortable with the bowl shape.May I ask how long your fringe/bangs are, and how short do you normally shave for the sides and back?"
"I normally show the barber a picture of bendeen (from his haircut video), a YouTuber, and ask the auntie to give me something similar. M ybangs are slightly past my eyebrows cos I prefer it a bit longer. For the sides, I cut maybe number 2 or 3, but I leave it to the barber for the most part. For the back, I talked to the barber auntie about giving it an undercut also, but she say will look nicer if she just cut short as per normal.Some other things to note, I cut the hair on my sides about once a week using some normal scissors and my toilet mirror"
"For the back, I talked to the barber auntie about giving it an undercut also, but she say will look nicer if she just cut short as per normal.Sorry, but what do you mean? Is your back cut slope instead?"
"I'm not sure, I just left it to the barber sorry 😅"
Haha it's ok. Thanks for replying though!
High slope
"Fade the sides, backcomb top. It's not the hairstyle it's the barber and that's all a good barber needs to work with. I've personally found that a good barber translates into a good haircut and he can work off with that simple line of instruction"
Any barber to recommend?
"Try salons where you stay nearby, I factor in travel time into the value of getting a haircut! I stay in the west so I go to The Base at Clementi. I don't find it worth the value of going to those gentleman's salon (panic room, golden rule) because they are so far from my house and nearly twice the price"
I have this fear of combining neighbourhood salons with high expectations :/
"HAHA. I know how you feel. It took me nearly 2 years before I found The Base. Just think of it as going to talk cock with the barber, if the haircut is shit then go to another salon! Just a baseline their haircut is $18 for guys include a wash and styling so pretty good value for me"
Tunnelsnake
Hair. Hair never changes
2 block haircut Because my sides always grow outwards instead of downwards haha
What does one tell a neighbourhood hairdresser for a 2 block cut?
Eh sometimes they don’t understand when I tell them 2 block haircut. So I just show them the photo and they know what to do alr. I think it was turned out quite decent for the few times I tried it at different barbers so you can do the same too ;)
Thanks will try it at my next cut!
"Hey, I'm thinking of getting a 2 block haircut too to solve the problem of my hair standing up stubbornly. But I'm still undecided cause I'm not sure if I will be comfortable with the bowl shape (some 2 block haircuts look really like a bowl, but some like the pic you linked doesn't. Is it the way they cut their top?)May I ask how long your fringe/bangs are, and how short do you normally shave for the sides and back?"
"I think maybe there’s some miscom w the barber? Don’t think it’s suppose to look like a bowl leh hahaha. Uhh I don’t really know the specifics but my fringe now maybe around my eyebrow level, the sides are shaved.Tbh, I just show them this photo and then they do the cutting. So far no issues ah"
Haha it's what I see from online comments. People always say it looks like a bowl cut or mushroom
"No ah, u can see some YT vids on 2 block haircut. Is actually not as bad as u think haha. Out of ns alr, must change up a bit 😂"
"Right now the go-to style is more on top, short on the side, if I'm not wrong."
mid fade or taper fade
"I'm currently growing my hair out to try a manbun, but if I were to keep my sides short, I would get a mid skin fade. Top textured quiff maybe 4-5 inches. Really want to try a Korean two block too"
Reservist done liao?
"just orded, last year, if I don't go for my first few few icts because of school, there's enough time to try out a manbun for awhile"
"Ah yes, if you have school for the next few years, go ahead and grow it out. Once you start work/reservist, it'll be 10 years before you can attempt any sort of manbun."

"St John's sea bass bred in 30% less time, resilient to diseasesProducers of a home-grown breed of fish are looking to take it global. St John's sea bass, developed by the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) in collabora-tion with Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, was cited by Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat as an example of how aquaculture is being transformed in Singapore.The breed is less susceptible to diseases and can be bred in 30 per cent less time. A start-up, Allegro Aqua, was set up when scientists from Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, working with various farms, demonstrated that they could scale up the production of St John's sea bass and that the fish could have better growth and survival rates.Dr Jiang Junhui, head of AVA's Marine Aquaculture Centre, said AVA has been working with Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory on a selective breeding programme for Asian sea bass since 2003. ""We contributed our expertise in breeding and brood stock facilities for the project,"" he added.St John's sea bass was named after the place where research on it was done - at the Marine Aquaculture Centre on St John's Island.This research, Allegro Aqua said, is the culmination of more than 15 years of advanced research efforts in genetic selection and mass cross-breeding done through dedicated and careful natural selection.""Allegro's St John's sea bass is naturally cultured through a selective breeding programme that leverages molecular markers to precisely select superior brood stocks with specific desirable traits,"" added its CEO Peter Chia.""From there, we can produce elite offspring through natural crossing which have better feed conversion ratio, fast growth qualities and a stouter physical structure resulting in higher fillet yield,"" he said.

Fish that grows faster (for faster profits) = use of commercial growth hormones (which you in turn consume and assume the long term risks of)Fish that don’t fall sick (to curb losses) = use of antibiotics which we should avoid ingesting unnecessarily (see the rise and dangers of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains)
They're selectively bred for those traits
Do you mean no hormones and antibiotics and GMO feed are used?

"Hi guys some background, I know I'm sort of an sg anomaly. I did really badly at school but I somehow managed to find myself in relatively ok-ish paying office jobs in marketing with self learning, street smarts and sheer hardwork.I'm 37 now with about 13 years of work exp in ad agencies and I have hit a plateau in my career advancements. I am currently a junior level digital marketing manager in a reputable finance institution and I wish to make a career jump to the United States within the next 3 to 5 years. The sooner the better.Should I pour some serious time (5 years) and money in an online degree? Or should I take a skills based course from General Assembly which takes about 6mths to complete?I'm considering part time as I still have a flat to finance on my own and other essentials like utilities and insurance."
"With that much experience I’d recommend taking relevant professional qualifications (the chartered blah blahs) over a generic distance learning university degree, IF you really want some qualifications to buff up your resume.However, that said if I were in your shoes I’d rather pick up some specific skills that are relevant to the job that I want to do, which may not not necessarily be the job you have now btw."
Hey thanks for the reply! May I know what are these chartered blah blahs lol?
"Accounting:CPA, ACCAfinance:CFAFew that i know of."
"What value could you add to the United States digital marketing industry? As far as I know, there is no shortage of marketing majors in the states.If you ask me, a Singaporean's USP is our ability to bridge China and US markets. If I were you, I would go down that road."
Thank you for this insightful tip 😉🙏
"General assembly too expensive, try edx"

"What kind of “career jump to the United States” are you planning, or do you mean you wish to migrate to the US?"
Yes to migrate
"Since you’re migrating to the US, have you looked at studying there so it might then be easier to get jobs there?"
"Going to the US without a degree is... Hard.The absolute easiest way to migrate there is to splurge on a US degree in STEM, following which you can get a 3 year visa to work there in any company, try and stick to one and make the miminum requirements to apply for PR, and then good luck. Of course, this is mother fuuuuucking expensive. For out of state students, you can be paying up to 60 - 70K for the programme. As you have only O levels, you will also likely need to do SATs to apply for a bachelor's programme.The more improbable method is to, as you say, upgrade your skills and improve your employability. But in the field of tech, it's going to be really hard to beat out the other people in the US. GA students are a dime a dozen, coming out of their 13 campuses with roughly the same level of skill as you (there were a lot of mid-career switches in my GA class in Sg two years ago, and that's who they primarily market to). The hardest thing to do is that you need to convince any future employer to hire you on the H1B1 (Singapore) visa, which has something like a 5000 slots per year quota (don't quote me on this) for Singaporeans looking for work, but almost never gets filled up. So this is good, in that your work visa is likely to be approved, but also bad, because you really need to convince the employer you're worth the additional effort.The harder, and near impossible method is to try for the green card lottery which happens every year, but your chances of winning it is very very very very low, as you're competing with millions of people for it.Anyway, what kind of skillset are you trying to achieve and what kind of jobs are you gunning for. It's hard to offer advice on GA vs degree without knowing that."

Hello guys! Does anyone know what will happen to my messaging platforms such as whatsapp/telegram if I suspend my line?I'm currently working on an ocean going ship and I need to stop paying for a service I don't even get to use while I'm away. My concern is that I won't be able to continue to communicate with my loved ones(ship has WiFi) if the messaging apps wouldn't work upon suspension of line.Any advice on what I can do for anyone who has experienced something similar? Thank you in advance!Edit: Thank you everyone for your input! Really appreciate the different ideas and experiences that have been shared. I've decided to suspend my contract and hope my phone or the app won't fail on me for the next few months I'm away. Cheers!
"Whatsapp needs a phone line. Telegram is tied to your phone number but usable without, unsure if cutting the line will shut down tele. If you have internet access why not consider using something else like kik or discord?"
Ah okay sure.. Unfortunately no one I know uses kik and discord is just for when I'm gaming haha.. Thank you for your input!
Skype? Also pretty sure you could teach your family how to use discord.
"Not sure if it's still the same but when I went abroad to study, I instructed Starhub to put my line on temporary suspension.I continued using Whatsapp on that number with no problems. You can continuing use those lines if they're already signed in but if you need to do some kind of SMS 2fa verification then it wouldn't work."
Thank you for sharing your experience! Yup I think so too. Now I'm wondering if PayNow will work haha..
"I would like to suggest perhaps transferring your line to circle life's $0 plan. Based on my understanding, you just need to have some sign of use every once in a while; think they allow up to 2-3 months of inactivity? Allows you to keep the number (thus the messaging services) at a low enough cost. I had a friend whose father recently passed away and his family decided to port his number so that the number is still active."
"Hmm. my contract is till August 2020 though, so it'll be a really long while before I can consider porting my number to other Telco.And I'm away 6-8 months at a time, I checked there's no roaming available for the $0 plan and I will not be in Singapore to make use of it so I guess there's no point in porting over haha..But really, thank you for your input and opening me up to circles.life. Made me read up more about what they have to offer."
"Whatsapp will work as long as it remains installed on the same phone. You can test it right now by switching on airplane mode. Suspending your cellular account will be the same as airplane mode as far as your phone is concerned. If you buy a new phone or have to factory reset yours, then you'll have to resume your cellular service to reactivate Whatsapp. Or you can buy a prepaid 180 day SIM card for $15 and use that as your Whatsapp number if you need to reinstall the app."
This is very useful and makes alot of sense too! Thank you so much!
"It will still work but if the app ever has problem and you need to reinstall it, you will need to receive OTP from it to login to your account.I've removed sim card and continued to use whatsapp before and it works fine."
Ah I hope it doesn't fail on me. Thank you for sharing your experience!
why not simply change to a prepaid service? I think you might be able to still keep your number.
Is it possible to change to a prepaid service using a number that is suspended temporarily? I've considered converting to prepaid service when my contract ends in August 2020 though.
"You can't port from postpaid to prepaid. And for prepaid lines, you need to keep topping up or else the number will be terminated."
"I see.. Yup at least I can have someone help top up for me whenever I need to use for roaming, etc. if I'm not mistaken"
you can even top up online now a days IIRC
All the more convenient heh. Thanks!
"You have to pay leh unfortunately.Maybe you wanna get the circles $0 as a 'main' line in the future. so it reduces the cost. but inactivity may be an issue again.alternatively if you are rich, just let it run and pay the bills"
"Yeah I have to pay about 6 bucks for suspension of line for a maximum period of 6 months? Better than having to pay an odd 60 bucks a month for nothing haha.. The circles $0 plan wouldn't benefit me as I'll most definitely be inactive while I'm away, so I'll probably consider switching to prepaid once my contract is up"
"haha reduce your plan to those $20/month?prepaid will be cheaper in the long-run, but may also face inactivity if you forgot to top up"
"It's alright! I've already suspended my line and only have to pay 5.35 a month. At least when I'm back, I still get to enjoy the benefits of my contract. Thanks though!"
Can anyone point me to someone for football or futsal games? I used to play(not professionally just with friends) back in my hometown and now I move to SG for work and I know no one that plays

"It was the best burger in their menu, no idea why they went and removed it."
I miss $2 double cheeseburger
"Yea price increase, no more 2 dollars."
That got me through so many poor student days. That and $2.50 filet o fish.
It's okay we still got cheap cai png =')
Now only got the bbq beef with egg. $2.80 somemore
"Lol replaced by the McDouble, a shrinkrayed double cheese minus one piece'a cheese."
This was my go to dinner during part time classes.
"Longtime Double Cheeseburger lover here, loved them since I was a broke kid. Recently found out a tip - Ask for a plain Double Cheeseburger (no sauce, pickles is personal preference). Was skeptical at first but at first bite you could taste the patty and cheese so clearly without the sauces. It has doubled my love for the Double Cheeseburger :)"
Its also fresher
mcdouble :(
"I can't believe they stopped selling this, it lured me into MCD so many times and I always bought the very expensive milkshake with it. It was the perfect snack."
"Probably because they get higher margins from their ""Angus"" burgers.Get the Angus Original + extra beef patty; it's more or less the same! Same sauce, same condiments, same patty, slightly better bun. More expensive than the old DQP though.p.s. Does anyone else think that the QP Patties and ""Angus"" Patties are the exact same, just marketed differently? I swear I can't tell them apart taste and texture-wise."
I think it may be a marketing scheme to brand the angus beef as more premium and so marked up at a higher price then by eliminating the qp from the menu they profit ez leaving you the consumer no choice. I also think they r almost the same just a substitute thats more ex :(
I TRIED ASKING FOR THAT! And I was spurned and felt like a fatty.
"Huh, interesting. It's a $2 top-up, try again!Don't feel like a fatty, its protein FOR THE GAINZ"
use those self service ordering kiosk! No more judgmental looks
It's still the same meat. It's just more expensive. Basically we're being ripped off.
"I dont like Angus patties, it felt a wee bit bitter to me. I now love the Big Mac and recent Prosperity Burgers. Their pattys does taste different to me."
Sorry u meant le Royale with cheese?
Upvote for the Pulp Fiction reference
Did you see a sign that says Pulp Fiction references?
It was my default burger in Mcd. What I do now is to order the double cheeseburger meal then order another DCB (ala carte) and stack the the patties together. I don't mind this as a substitute as there is more cheese now.
"Take my upvote, I miss that thing. The Angus is the only thing close now, and it's more expensive."
i miss kfc double down lol
Wasabi filet o fish
my nose dies with every bite but i loved it while it lasted.
yeah the double quarter pounder with cheese was the best for beef menu in Macs. now you order their original angus also no kick.
My flair shows how much I miss it. Now I just go Burger King or other Burger joint if my quarter pounder needs.
"Singapore's McDonald's suck, they remove all the delicious stuff from their menu because they can't keep up with the demand and always run out of stocks in every outlets."
"mcdouble was cheap for its protein, now it's gone and i have to buy double cheeseburger"
I thought the single quarter pounder was removed from the McDonald’s menu as well?
"Yep, both the quarter pounder and double quarter pounder are gone."
Ain't that just cheeseburger?
"Nope, a cheeseburger has even smaller beef patties, slightly smaller than the bun.A McDouble is a cheeseburger + extra beef patty.A double cheeseburger is a McDouble + extra cheese slice.A Big Mac is a McDouble + extra bun, different sauce and vegetables.A quarter pounder is a cheeseburger but the beef patty exceeds the size of the bun and is thicker, claimed to measure a quarter pound before being cooked.A double quarter pounder is a quarter pounder + extra quarter pound of beef patty.Unless you were talking flavour-wise. Then they all taste similar except for Big Mac (duh)."
I miss the mcspicy patty for $2
Nacho fillet o fish anyone??
Everytime i order that they still give me tartar sauce filet o fish
I miss it very much.Sometimes you just wanna go Mcdonalds and not have to suffer lao sai latter.Even their double beef prosperity burger is sold out now.
"i personally don’t like the prosperity burgers, like what’s so special? it’s just long beef patties covered with hot sauce (hot, not spicy) that will get your mouth dirty. and the sauce ain’t even nice"
"IKR, the intense peppery taste drowns out any other flavour the burger might have.Still confuses me how it's so popular rn"
CNY ending soon liao where got stock...
I actually miss their fish and fries
Better than lonh john silver's during that short period.
The ljs compared to many years ago honestly now is shit
I wish they bring back the crispy chicken rice burger. :<
FAN TAS TIC
I actually just miss the regular Quarter Pounder. The new Angus burgers just aren't the same - patty tastes somewhat similar but overall taste is different cos of the bun.
I just get the Original Angus and change the bun to mcspicy bun lol closest thing to a QP
"Was wondering if anybody was like me order and eat a ""pounder""... (4 beef patties)But yeah, even if you're a young and healthy teenager, you can FEEL the heart attack coming..."
"Nah, I preferred the Royale with Cheese"
I miss the double big Mac actually
Teppanyaki chicken mcgrill anyone?
Yknow what I miss. I miss my spicy Mc wrap why they remove it!!!!!
Not really. I like the $2 cheeseburger better and way cheaper
I miss foldover
Customize the classic angus with an extra patty.Thats double quarter there.Can go even further by removing the mayo and chicken bacon add pickle.Classic angus was the reason they removed quarter pounder.
"the angus beefburger now so small, tilt"
Bring back my McGriddles too :(
"it was back for a while last year or the year before? Ate it everyday, was a nostalgic item I used to get every day for breakfast"
I miss:Grilled Chicken FoldoverTeppanyaki Chicken McGrillQuarter Pounder$2 Double Cheeseburger$2 Fillet-O-Fish
"You will be delighted to know that somehow Grilled Chicken Foldover is actually back, ordered GrabFood last night and saw Grilled Chicken Foldover on the menu, got it instantly, recipe seemed to have changed a little though"
I miss rendang burger from Burger King. The old recipe was sex.
MCGRIDDLES come back pls
I ordered it every time I went mcs ;-;
I really dont get it. How is it that such a shitty product like mcdonalds is such a hit in singapore
It's cheap and their outlets have AC.
Me.And McGriddles.Kudos to McDonalds for removing items that I loved because now I'm moving on to superior burgers at Burger King.
turkey bacon still my favbut goddamn it where'd the rendang go again

"My company is in a shared office with 2-3 other companies. If one of the companies (not my company) kena writ of seizure and sale, will my company's assets be taken? Also, if i have personal belongings in lockers and cabinets that are of value, will they be taken too? (i have no relation to the company that kena WSS other than the fact that we share an office)"
"Had a similar experience to yours a few years back. My company was related to another due to same directors but treated and operated as completely separate entities. The other company got into trouble and had to be shut down. Only assets and items belonging to the company were taken and liquidated. Personal items were untouched, though if placed in or with seized items were taken first and claimed later (damn bloody leceh)."
"so technically my landlord's stuff will be kena seized also? its quite stupid leh, cos from my knowledge the company in trouble is a very small company. no registered assets under its balance sheet. and no leased property, zero assets other than cash in bank and maybe a laptop. lets say the bailiff come into the premise with 100 over computers. more than 50 machines, and boxes and boxes of valuable goods belonging to other companies, they can technically seize all? then everyone have to slowly claim?"
"If it's real estate it's a little bit different. In case of seizure tenants will be notified to vacate premises by certain time. After which any item left behind owner must claim it back if they want to retrieve it. Tenants affected no choice got to find another place quickly. I am not sure if they can seek compensation from landlord due to such inconveniences or extension to vacate premises.If the company has no assets on balance sheet, has to be verified. Nobody can anyhow seize things one don't worry."
"no...as in, because the landlord also have some computers and equipment, then he will also kena seized? cos the company that is in trouble is a super duper small company."
You are what is known as an “interpleader” or a person who is not a party to a case but wants to be heard as your rights will be affected. Submit this form at the state courts. https://www.statecourts.gov.sg/cws/CivilCase/Pages/InterpleaderSummons.aspx
Do you have any idea which assets the company owns? Because the bailiffs only can take the assets which belongs to the liquidated company.
"to my best knowledge, the registered assets is only a computer, a printer and cash in bank.however, when the bailiffs come to the premise, there will be lots of computers around the place, and probably valuables also, how do they determine those computer belong to who?i know in normal circumstances, they have the right to seize any valuable assets in the premise, then anyone claiming that the item belongs to them instead of the liquidated company can file a claim to those items. however, in this case its very stupid to do that cos out of the 100 over computers/laptops in the shared office, only 1 computer belongs to the liquidated company.but as its a shared office, there is no clear signage as to show which area belongs to which company, its an open concept shared office, where we roam around using laptops. so there isnt any closed door offices within the office, everything is visible and almost accessible.just wanna understand what usually happens in this case? how can the bailiffs be convinced that the liquidated company which owes tens of thousands of dollars, only have 1 computer out of the 100+ at the office?"
"i dont want a case where i have to show proof of every valuable items i have in the office that belongs to my company instead of the liquidated company.also like we have a coffee machine that i personally bought, but i share it with everyone in the office, including the people from the liquidated company. say this item is of value, do i have to proof that this coffee machine is mine? or else they will take it away?"
No only their assets will be sized
"when the bailiffs arrive, how do they determine which assets belong to which company when everybody's items are placed in the office in the open?"
You should be able to proof its yours
"GG hope we don't jinx ourselves by calling it ""invincible"".Is like ""unsinkable"", ""mission accomplished"" - really asking for it."
An unsinkable submarine defeats the entire purpose of a submarine.
🤔🤔🤔
taps noggin
I'm guessing it's just a legacy of ship-naming in the Royal Navy which we inherited.
The Royal Navy “invincible” class is their air craft carrier.
There's also the Royal Navy battlecruiser from world war 1... Which had it's magazine blow up in the Battle of Jutland

"All three have already been decommissioned, dude."
"I did not disagree with you, dude."
Great way to show Dr M what we can do to all his rickety sampans.
"I don't even think he cares. Malaysian Army have been going for decades of neglect in their logistic side. The submarines didn't work so is their aircraft maintenence.To be honest, it doesn't even matter as Malaysia looks to be very safe in the near future. Military is a luxury that many can't afford.They need to fix their economy before fixing their army which going to take at least a decade, if they can even pull it off."

invincible. that’s what they said about the titanic.
Sorry to be that pedant but the Titanic was said to be unsinkable. Not much marketing value for a passenger cruise ship to be touted as being undefeatable in combat.
"Anyone find it weird that the submarine was launched by the minister's Wife, a civilian? Is that common practice or maybe some pantang thing that ladies must do it?Can't wait to get our own aircraft carrier and park it off the Tuas port"
http://navymuseum.co.nz/the-tradition-of-launching-ships-by-women/yes it is.
Actually they want call halimah go but navy ownself pantang with malays
A president to launch a military vessel!?Is that even a good idea?
Nice!
"Can't wait to get our own aircraft carrier and park it off the Tuas portlmao. If Singapore have aircraft carrier, the whole RSN fleet personnel will get redeployed to that. Even then, it would still not be enough people to operate it."
Does RSN even has enough vessel to support an aircraft carrier?
Not enough people
"Not only that, RSAF would also have to redeploy its aircrafts or get new aircrafts to support the aircraft carrier. Otherwise, it would just be a white elephant"
Singapore needs a flying aircraft carrier
"No, it's a common tradition around the world, be it civilian or military, for a female to christen and launch the ship."
naval traditions states that a lady should be the one launching the ship
"Ha, the Tuas port is an ant compared to Changi, there's no way an aircraft carrier can ever hope to dock here.On Google Maps you can see that the aircraft carrier probably won't be able to go past Jurong Island into the Tuas bay."
When Singapore hosts aircraft carriers they usually dock at Changi Naval Base.
is it LAM capable? i cant imagine this as a blockade breaker in a busy strait like ours
"Submarine is for offense and recon, not so much a defensive weapon."
"an effective sub is a very potent weapon for area denial. half the enemy vessels wld be running around just to hunt down a sub. the other half also running around, but to avoid the sub."
"Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen officiated at the launch ceremony of the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN)'s first Invincible-class submarine, Invincible, at the thyssenkrupp Marine Systems Shipyard in Kiel, Germany, on 18 Feb 2019. The submarine was launched by Mrs Ng, wife of Dr Ng. Chief of German Navy Vice-Admiral Andreas Krause, Republic of Singapore Navy's Chief of Navy Rear-Admiral Lew Chuen Hong and senior defence officials from both countries attended the launch ceremony.Speaking at the ceremony, Dr Ng highlighted that, ""The RSN plays a key role in keeping [the] Sea Lines of Communications (SLOCs) open, not only for Singapore, but indeed, for the world. And the maritime environment around Singapore also faces security challenges… In this context, the acquisition of the new Type 218SG submarines is timely."" He added that that the new submarines were designed based on experience and expertise garnered through more than two decades of operating submarines, and the launch of the Invincible marked a significant milestone in the RSN’s submarine capability. Invincible is the first of four customised submarines designed for operations in Singapore's shallow and busy tropical waters. Custom-built to Singapore's needs, the new submarines will possess longer endurance and higher payloads. Following the launch, Invincible will undergo a series of sea trials before delivery to Singapore in 2021. The remaining three submarines are under construction. Dr Ng also announced the names of the remaining three submarines – Impeccable, Illustrious, and Inimitable. The launch of Invincible is testament to the warm and growing defence ties between Singapore and Germany. Bilateral defence relations have strengthened with the signing of the enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (eDCA) in 2018. The eDCA paves the way forward for cooperation in areas of mutual interest, such as in submarine training, defence technology and cyber defence. Both countries also cooperate and interact widely through high-level visits and dialogues, military exchanges, cross-attendance of professional courses and technology collaboration.Dr Ng was in Germany to attend the Munich Security Conference from 15 to 17 Feb 2019, where he spoke at the conference and had bilateral meetings with his foreign counterparts.

"Singapore should have one nuclear sub (nuclear powered, not a sub with nukes) operating farther out, to preserve strategic threat in case of war of ability to hurt anyone attacking it badly with missile barrage. Would make most realistic threats (Malaysia, Indonesia, China) think a bit more before doing anything if it ever came to that (which I don't think it will).It's kind of like Switzerland. Sure, they couldn't hold off the Germans in WW2 (or Russians in Cold War) if they went at it, but they could make it hurt. Hurt enough that the other side just never decided to go through with it."
Why shouldn't Singapore have nuclear weapons?
"In layman's term, if Singapore does acquire nuclear weapons we will be breaking the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty, which aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, which can lead to hurtful economic sanctions and increase regional tension (See Pakistan, North Korea, Iran etc).For whatever reasons, the world powers decided Singapore should be able to have nuclear weapons. The cost and space just to store and maintain the missile is incredibly high, John Oliver did a decent piece on USA's lax maintenance of it's nuclear arms.TL:DR Damn troublesome, little benefits."
"That's a separate (but I agree legitimate and important) discussion. I was merely restricting myself to the submarines power source to not detract too much from the topic at hand.I do think there's a reasonable argument to be made for Singapore to have nukes, ideally in a submarine for credible second-strike retaliatory capability (like Israel). the main issue is world response, possible sanction, escalation in region (Malaysia/Indo will want them too), etc.Since Singapore is has by far strongest airforce in region and welll, ultimately the US wouldn't let anyoen do anythign anyways, it might make nukes superfluous. So better off waiting."
"Nuclear weapons are a great deterence and with a ballistic missile sub, we wouldn't even have to park the nuclear warheads in sg. Cut off our water? Bye bye KL. Invade us? We might die, but you'll die a worst death."
""
"So you support nuclear proliferation?Pray tell who even wants to go after this tiny piece of land? What's the strategic value in it?Natural resources? NoneAccess to Malacca Strait and South China Sea? Any number of countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, etc can build ports if they really want toWhere's the case for nuclear deterrence?"
"Serious question: how do they deliver it? Do we have a naval base in Germany, or is it piloted across the sea to Singapore, or...?Edit: asked the obvious, sooo.... 🙄"
They FedEx it. Hopefully we paid a few dollars extra for express delivery
Express delivery has better skip transit at Hong Kong and go straight to Singapore from Germany.
Got tracking & insurance or not....
They sail it to Singapore duh.
"Yeah, sail back lo. But highly likely the initial crew will go over, train for several months, and then sail it back."
They use SingPost.
"He asked how did they deliver Singapore's submarine, not Malaysia's one."
Friend is there training to be one of the crew now. They will sail it home obv.
How long will the journey take? Are you able to find out?
Ehhh.... no. Classified. And it wont be for awhile yet

"Hey r/singapore,Recently, my father was diagnosed with Stage 4 nasopharyngeal cancer and will be undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy soon. We were lucky enough that it has not spread to the brain yet.Anyone out here went through similar experiences or even survived through cancer, please do advise and share some dos and donts to help make things easier for both the victim and its family, things to be mentally and emotionally prepared if the worst happens.EDIT - 19/2Thank you all for the heartfelt comments, advises and sharing all your experiences. Love you guys and screw you cancer."
"hi OP, i am very sorry to hear this news. my FIL was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in the year i married and i can empathise with how you feel.i am not a medical doctor but would like to just share that it is important to make your dad feel loved and supported during treatment.he may have so many thoughts from fighting the illness all the way to the afterlife - my hubby's family went through so many rollercoasters - but it is key to make him feel he is not alone and if the untowards happens, that you and your family will always have him in your hearts and live your life beautifully for him. even if he lashes out (my fil went from the nicest man to someone very difficult within the span of 5 minutes sometimes), do not lose your temper. just be there to support him as much as possible.start looking into making a will and definitely into a Lasting Power of Attorney. it will help your family if your dad loses his faculties.would advise if you have not gotten a helper, you may need to get one, or a trained nurse if your family can afford it. otherwise do check out the hospice home care services (http://singaporehospice.org.sg/services/) - these angels are really a godsend in tough times.you may also want to look out for one other's mental health. my MIL went into depression and was suidical upon my FIL's death for a very long time. i regret not watching out for this point actually. if your dad is not too weak, simple meals or visits to nearby parks help build memories that get through the grief.and never ever be afraid to tell your dad you love him. all the time, every time.i wish you all the best and my very dearest wishes for your dad's recovery."
"This.Will for what happens to his estate when he passes - even if not from the cancerLasting Power of Attorney for making surrogate decisions while he is alive but incapacitatedAdvanced Medical Directive to decide if he wants life-saving treatment in event of deteriorationAdvanced Care Plans to discuss with family members and come to a conclusion on the expectations and actions as the illness progresses.It might seem morbid that you are planning for a death soon after a diagnosis, but the alternative really is dealing with all the drama about inheritance and money after a patient dies when you should really be allowed to simply grieve."
"start looking into making a will and definitely into a Lasting Power of Attorney. it will help your family if your dad loses his faculties.This is super important. It may seem callous to focus on the will, but I had a close friend with a rare & aggressive stage IV cancer not tie up loose ends and it has had some nasty consequences afterwards.you may also want to look out for one other's mental health.This too. Some people handle it well, others, very poorly. Same friend that passed, his wife is relatively 'okay'. Another person related to the same friend went into deep, dark depressive state. It is tough when everyone is going through it to look out for each other, but it does require the ones that are 'okay' to step back from the immediacy of the situation to see who is not coping well and try to get them help.To the OP. It's a very trying time and each person deals with this type of situation differently.Empathy, patience and communication is key. Be thoughtful and positive, love and care for each other, no matter what they say or do.Life is too fragile to hold grudges or be petty and this is a scenario where your family needs to be strong together."
"My father passed away from cancer when I was 15. I don't know much about the medical aspect of things so I'll share more about what I regret not doing/am glad I did.If possible, discuss about what he would want if his condition, unfortunately, gets worse. My father passed away at home. Before he did, we called for the paramedics. One of them kept pressuring my mother and asking if she wanted them to bring him to the hospital. My mother said that she knows he wouldn't want that and would rather pass away peacefully at home. I'm glad that she knew what he wanted or we would have been left so conflicted and wondering if we made the right choice for the rest of our lives. I feel that this is especially important in this case given that the cancer can potentially spread to his brain. It's a difficult conversation to have but it's an important one.Record videos and take photos of your father, anything to remember how they sound and look like.Be understanding and patient. Being on cancer medication sucks. It makes you nauseous, sleepy and unmotivated. Make time for your father and try your best to make him feel better even if he can sometimes be cranky or be in too much pain to even interact.Tell him you love him and open yourself up to him. I was never openly affectionate towards my father and it's something I deeply regret. Ask him about his youth, what he hopes you grow up to be and all that. Remember to record these moments down.I hope the best for you and your family."
"Take care. Stay strong for your family. You will need it.My father was diagnosed with stage 4 npc as well. It was discovered during his yearly medical checkup, where the medical staff discovered a lump on his neck. Cancer was found to have spread to his lymph nodes(the ones causing the lump at the neck), the bones, liver and lungs. The cancer was so widespread, and taking into consideration my dad's advancing age, my dad was given only the choice of chemotherapy. He responded well to chemo for the first 2 rounds. All cancer had shrunk. However, subsequent rounds had no effect on the cancer. We went for clinical trials in hopes of a miracle, but the trials are of no effect.Even with such disappointing clinical results, we were still not worried then. My dad was still physically and emotionally fine. He was still physically active and was still going around the neighborhood doing his usual business.But I guess his outgoing nature may have caused his demise. He may have caught pneumonia when he was out and about. His compromised immune system due to previous chemo and his insistence on not wearing a facial mask may have sped up his death. He passed on due to complications from pneumonia about one year after being diagnosed with cancer."
No signs and symptoms at all other than the lump? Did anyone notice the lump before the doctor pointed it out?
"The lump on the neck is very small, you can't really tell unless you touch the area surrounding it. No other symptoms, so the whole affair caught us by absolute surprise.Well, good reason to give your loved ones a neck massage now and then."
"My SO suffered through lymphoma some time back. Had 6 months of chemo and now 1+ year in remission. Next CT is a week from now, but so far signs are good.One tip is to feedback quickly to the medical staff if the chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting is bad and have them change it at the next dose. It is far easier to prevent the nausea than to control it once it has broken through."
"Hello OP, my mom suffered this 10 years ago and i have to tell you this. You need to give your father support for the treatment your father will undergo. He needs each and every one of you and your family right now. My mom suffered from depression during the period(might be due to side effects) when i was serving NS so she suffered while i was away."
"Hi OP, I'm very sorry to hear about your father's situation. My father was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer and has been undergoing some treatment. It seems to be controlled for now but I don't know for how long. Background info, my father was first discovered to have lung cancer when he went to a local neighbourhood government hospital after coughing up blood. Later on we were referred to National Cancer Centre and he has been receiving treatment from National Cancer Centre ever since.I'm only able to share, not advise. Every day is a learning day for me where it comes to this disease. Your own experience may be different, so take what I say below with an open mind and hey, I hope to hear from you on your experience as well.The lack of confirmation in diagnosis - I was stunned from the start by how little confirmation anyone could give me. The doctors in Khoo Teck Puat were able to confirm the existence of a mass, but not more than that. They seemed particularly careful about not giving my family expectations or false hopes about the seriousness of the situation. They would only tell us that - yes, there's a growth in the lung, yes, it seems to have spread to various spots in the body, yes, it is likely malignant. No details on staging etc. We expected to hear more from the National Cancer Centre, but there were so many criteria for regarding a cancer as being stage 1, 2, 3 or 4, that the oncologist (after 1 biopsy and another PET scan) told us to ""best that we treat this as a stage 4 case"", i.e. we are not looking for a cure, we are looking at control. My lesson: This is the fact of the disease. It is THIS complex and it IS deadly, so the oncologist has to balance the difficult role of presenting treatment options, being realistic and yet not killing off hope where hope is available.Confronting yourself on cure and control - I am still coming to terms with the fact that my father has no cure for his disease. It was very difficult to grasp the figures that the oncologist was giving to us, and it was too much information for us to consume all at once. But what I recall is that there is a 5 year target survival mark. For lung cancer stage 4, with treatment - 5% reach 5 years, majority don't make it past 2 years. We were presented with chemotherapy, and immunotherapy as options. Surgery and radiotherapy was out of the question. Within a few weeks of being presented these options, we were recommended immunotherapy and went along with it. I found myself believing that immunotherapy could cure my father. This was because I would search the internet for info on immunotherapy and I would focus only on the good parts of it. I tended to give less weight to the fact that majority of recipients of chemotherapy or immunotherapy would see no improvement in their condition. So imagine my family's horror when one night we had to rush him down to A&E because his heart lining was filling up with water because of his reaction to the immunotherapy. Thankfully, he survived that episode (although he was weakened considerably) and the treatment had to be changed to a mixed chemo-immuno therapy that seems to be keeping things stable for now. It is still not easy to manage however, because now that we have identified a stable working treatment, we deal with the side effects (or rather my mother the primary caregiver, deals with the side effects all day) of the treatment. His skin is itching incredibly all over his body, he gets hot very easily, and his weight keeps dropping. Sometimes the treatment causes stomach upsets and he doesn't get to eat what he likes, and even if he keeps to a strict diet, sometimes he still gets diarrhoea. My lesson: Take every day one step at a time, and take the internet articles with a pinch of salt. Don't hope for a cure. Just work on cherishing each day.OK when I say ""cherish each day"", I don't just mean to cherish each day with my dad. Yes, I am spending whatever time I can with my father, but I also cherish each day that he is still alive and I can live it out normally. When we were first faced with the illness, I was very hung up over many things. I couldn't accept that he could be taken from me so soon. My family lived on edge, because we didn't know if he was going to have some reaction or catch some infection that could kill him at any time. I wondered if this was the right way to live through this period. At several times, I also felt guilty (I still do) getting angry with my father's complaining and sometimes unreasonable behaviour (there was this time when I thought he would like to eat curry rice and he threw a tantrum when he felt the service was bad - Later I realised that he was depressed that he would have a stomach upset after enjoying the meal, and that caused his tantrum). I think I myself am a bit depressed now - but what is keeping me going is the fact that, we don't have a say in this, but life must somehow go on. So I was very glad that my father had approached me to get a lawyer to draft his will and settle his Lasting Power of Attorney. I also reminded him to get his CPF nomination in order. And I am very lucky to have strong family and friends around me to help my dad - I wasn't that important to assisting my dad after all. My lesson: Life must go on. There is nothing wrong in helping your family and yourself move on in spite of the disease.Be strong, be there, your time will be spread out thin and you may have to make sacrifices for the greater good.2017 all I wanted to hear was ""you got promoted"". Today, all I want to hear is ""dad's in remission"". How far things can fuck up - you better believe it.I don't know if this is gibberish that is meaning less, but this really sums up what I feel I have been doing. I think if I keep this up, I won't regret when I look back at my actions.Hang in there."
"Dad unfortunately passed away some time back from intestinal lymphoma. My rather morbid experience about cancer is that when a loved one is diagnosed, regardless of positive signs of improvements, somewhere at the back of my head I mentally prepared for the worst given the nature of this terrible, terrible disease. It somewhat helped me overcome the grief when my dad passed.As for more practical advice, always encourage your dad to head to the hospital ASAP if there are any serious symptoms outside what you would expect from chemo and radiotherapy. The final time my dad went to the hospital was after a couple of weeks of resisting going despite really bad symptoms like not being able to keep food down. Not sure if being admitted earlier would have change things, but staying at home surely didn't help.Stay strong and I wish you and your father the best. No one should have to go through this."
"Hey OP. It doesn’t get easier. It will be exhausting. All the other replies give great advice, just make sure to take care of yourself too, especially your mental wellbeing."
"Damn, I'm sorry to hear. You have my sympathies.My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in 2002. He had been coughing a lot in the months prior and by the time he had it checked it was very late. He went into chemotherapy, and it was brutal like everyone says. He lost a lot of weight and managed to keep it at bay for a year or so... unfortunately the cancer metathesized and he passed on in 2003. I think if he didn't stress his body by going to China (long story) he might have pulled through for another year or two.Right now it's going to be tough, but I hope you can stay strong. Spend time with your father and make him feel loved and that he has people with him.Take care and all the best, I hope your dad can beat this!"
I just want to say it's terrible what you're going through and I hope for the best for you and your family.Comments in this thread are all gold.
"My heart goes out to you OP. Cancer sucks, and its my hope we find cures for it within our lifetime. My Dad got stage 1 prostate cancer last year, but the nurse told him it was stage 4 when it wasn't, and it absolutely devastated me.Stay strong OP, I'm giving you a virtual hug out."
"Op, stay strong and be there for your dad. Your support is vital. Also if he has any specific requests or you wanna do anything for or with him, try not to procrastinate because you may not get a ""later"". Try to maintain peaceful surroundings which is essential for a cancer patient because they need rest especially after chemo. Talk to him with encouragement often.My dad died due to colon cancer last year Feb. It was a shock to us and caught us unaware and unprepared. He was supposed to be discharged that day.Jiayou. If you need to talk can dm me."
"Lost my dad to the same cancer a few years back, he didn't survive the second relapse. He had chemo and radiation treatment the first time, then surgery the second. And it still came back.Just be with your dad as much as possible.You might want to consider getting a referral from a polyclinic to go for a laryngeal scope yourself. They will also do a blood test to detect a known viral trigger. Nose cancer could be inheritable, and the prognosis is good if detected early.This may come as cruel advice at a wrong time but, my advice is to check yourself regularly from now. Don't let the same happen to your family again."
"Try not to go for surgery if possible and always get a second opinion. My dad had stage 1 cancer and our local doctor in a new local hospital that the government hyped as ""world class"" recommended an op to remove the cancer. Said was low risk ""about 5 percent risk of mortality""Opened up and realized that his condition was worse than diagnosed by almost everything but he still went ahead with the op on his own initiative. My dad passed away from the complications.All operations carried risks so think carefully.Said hospital also started sending debt collectors to start hounding me for the bill within a weekNever be complacent and show your dad as much love and concern as you can."
"I’m a bit late here, but just wanted to share something with you.My dad passed away 10 years ago from colon cancer, similarly diagnosed with stage 4.After he did his chemo etc, he got a lot better for a few months, and we thought that things would be ok, so life went on to some extent.Then he had a fever one night, and we sent him to the hospital to check it out. Turns out, he had a major relapse, and he passed away 3 weeks after.My biggest regret is hoping (and believing) that he would get better, and not preparing for the worst.I wish I had spent more time with him - so, if I could offer a small piece of advice: don’t make that mistake with your dad."
"dont really have much to contribute but just want to say to you stay strong, and may your dad kick cancer's ass.Wishing your dad a speedy recovery!"
"I'm sorry I can't give any advice, but stay strong and take care of yourself too."
I lost 2 close relatives to cancer recently. They were diagnosed with stage 4 and sadly didn’t live long after the diagnosis. One died 3 weeks later and another suffered for 2 months before he passed. You will spend most of your time shuffling in and out of hospital. And the patient will be in a lot of pain after many tests and poking done. I dont honestly think it’s even necessary but the doctor will say that it is.You have to be strong and expect the worst and also spend as much time as possible with your Dad. You can still be hopeful as some people do survive. Also check if he has any insurance that covers critical illness. It can help to pay the hospital bills as it will be very expensive. Most importantly is to make sure your Dad is comfortable. Again when this happens you also will have to check your own lifestyle and maybe go for tests or screenings. My aunt has daughters and they have to go for mammogram or cervical cancer screening. 2 of my Aunt’s sisters have cancer too. And if you’re a smoker maybe best to smoke less. I don’t know why but I have a disdain for smokers smoking right next to me while I’m outside and tolerate cigarettes less after losing my Uncle. It was very debilitating for him he lost a lot of weight and was in constant pain. It’s just horrible...
"Man i am really sorry that your DAD and you family are going through this terrible time.My father was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer (was given 4-6 months after diagnosis), went through chemotherapy and was given a clean bill of health (we were amazed how his entire dark lung from xray became clean like nothing had happen to him).Fast forwarding to 1 year after given clean bill of health, cancer came back and spread to his bones and other parts. His health deteriorate quite quickly and he passed away in a few weeks.I pray your father live long and healthy life, just spend more time and treasure him. And be kind with them, as in this stage they get more agitated and delusional. I hope we had more time with my father but i am glad we had more happy than sad days before he passed away."
"My father(now in heaven) was accidentally diagnosed with esophagus melanoma(one of the rarest cancer to occur on the inside) in 2008. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy doesn't work for melanoma and the only option was surgery. The surgery was done with the esophagus being removed. However the cancer started spreading and by July 2009 he was gone. I can't express how painful those last 6 months were.Now from my experience here are a few suggestions to you:Don't let the doctors do a clinical trial on your father. They will try to make promises don't fall for them.Send the reports to Sloan Kettering MIT and as many other world renowned doctors and hospitals as you can(Most of them reply)DO NOT GO FOR SURGERY UNLESS IT'S THE LAST OPTIONDO NOT LET THEM DO REPEATED BIOPSY OF THE CANCERStay strong and prepared for every outcome. I know it's hard to think about family finances at this hard time but ask your father everything about his finances, bank accounts, investments etc.Don't lose hope."
Accidentally?
No symptoms at all. He went for an endoscopy for his acidity issues and the polyps were seen on the way to the stomach.
He had acid reflux? How long had he been having it before the cancer diagnosis? Controlled by medication / diet?
"He had acid reflux for a long time. When he consulted a gastroenterologist he asked him to do an endoscopy.What I figured out is that if the cancer was not diagnosed and disturbed, he would have lived much longer than just 6 months from date of diagnosis."
"It's true. Some cancers if you leave it alone, it doesnt spread but once you poke at it, it turns aggressive. It's called 'tumor seeding'"
"I am sorry for your loss, did the doctor mention what the prognosis for your father if he chose not to underwent any invasive treatment"
"Yes, he told that the prognosis will be really good as they will take out all the impacted areas."
"I think the word here is ""incidentally"".In any case, best not to let your personal feelings cloud someone else's judgment.Depending on the type of cancer, surgery is indeed the first line which usually results in a cure - which is the case for most early stage solid tumour cancers.Where do you think our local National Cancer Centre doctors train? Hint: You mentioned one of those places"
I agree but there are enough cases where surgery leads to sudden spread of cancer.I agree the doctors are good in Singapore but it's always good to get second opinion. Medical science improves everyday and it takes time for drugs and technology to reach around the world.
"It's really hard to tell if the surgery leds to the spread of cancer. There are postulations that surgery itself can seed tumours; but micro-metastases which are too small to be detected by CT/MRI also exist. It is difficult to isolate the effect from either phenomenon to conclusively say what caused the spread.Don't disagree on second opinions but do beware on ""opinion-fishing"" - which is to doctor hop until someone tells you what you want to hear."
I agree it's hard to tell. At the end of the day it's OP and OPs family's choice to make. Every case is unique. I hope OPs father gets well soon
"Anyone has been to one and can recommend or share your experiences?Edit: for soon to weds or newly weds. Eg marriage prep class?Helpful suggestions only please.Please no ""divorce la/dont marry la/you cant even talk to your own SO meh"" things please lol"
"Here you go.https://www.msf.gov.sg/policies/Marriages/Preparing-for-Marriage/Pages/default.aspxThe ""Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Programme (PREP)"" is aimed at newly-weds or soon-to-weds. You might want to look into it.Also, at the very bottom of the webpage (for mobile) or the side menu (for desktop) is a link to a Rebate Web Brochure PDF. It contains a list of other social services that provide marriage counselling as well as their fees. You might find that helpful too."
"To add on, the PREP done at Cornerstone is one good secular program. Also subsidized by MSF"
We took the one by touch community services and it was very good. Good to have other people help to set expectations for the marriage so that couples know how to communicate and handle conflict. After marriage we went EMCC which is pretty good too
what did you do/talk about in the touch one? and agar how much was it?
"Mostly how to communicate and handle conflict. Quite a lot of hands on stuff you will get to practice, lots of people ending up crying. The facilitators were genuine and actively sought to follow up on us after the sessions were over (had dinner with them once I think)It's $330 and they'll refund you like $70 or something once it's completed"
"Hi! I attended the pre-marriage prep course organised by Touch Community Services.Basically, the course was held at a volunteer couple's home and has three or four sessions. You get to talk about stuff such as communication, finances, dealing with your in-laws and intimacy. It's really good - the course sparked conversations that my wife and I would not have otherwise. I've also taken many of the advice from the volunteers to heart; I'm sharing many things with my wife that I would not have in the past.You can PM me for more details if you wish! Here's wishing you and your S/O a blissful marriage!"
"It’s a good thing to try, especially if both parties aren’t the best communicators :)"
"It’s good to hear that you are exploring marriage prep class. If you don’t voluntarily go for one, you will still have to attend a mandatory one before you are allowed to register your marriage. (As pointed out by /u/MiloDinoStylo, it is not compulsory)I went for the single couple marriage preparatory class at Eagles Mediation & Counselling Centre, and it was extremely helpful for my spouse and I to talk about and explore topics that we had not prior to the course. One might be tempted to think, “I can just talk with my spouse on my own, why need to pay $XXX just to do the same thing?”. However one reason is just that it doesn’t occur to you to discuss some of the topics that are raised. Furthermore, you may not understand/know some things about your spouse that a counsellor is able to identify and bring up for discussion.I definitely recommend going for a marriage preparatory course, and I’d also recommend EMCC. Do keep in mind that come of the courses listed on MSF website are conducted by a religious institute so if you are not of that faith, you might consider choosing another course ."
Is emcc secular? My SO and i are both quite against any religious teachings.You are the 2nd person to recommend eagles and you just gave me some ammo to convince my fiance. Haha thanks!
"Yes they are secular, they will only discuss religion if either you or your fiancé indicate that you are religious yourselves, and although we didn’t discuss it as my spouse and I are free thinkers, I suspect the discussion will just be limited to how you will practice your faith if only one is religious, how will you bring up the child etc.EMCC came as a recommendation from my closest friend so that’s why we ended up going there, it was a very good experience! All the best for your fiancé and you!"
How much did you pay if you dont mind? And was your spouse receptive? Haha these are my main concerns now
"I think it was about $400, but there is a rebate of $70 on completion. We both wanted to attend a marriage preparatory course so we were both on the same page about this"
i second emcc. lovely bunch of people@
"If you don’t voluntarily go for one, you will still have to attend a mandatory one before you are allowed to register your marriage.wat?I got married last May and didn't have such requirements. The most was I had 2 session with my Marriage solemnizer where we talked about marriage and he suggested we go one."
"Oh sorry I think I was slightly mistaken, I think it was compulsory if you were below age of 18, will amend my original statement"
"Not sure if you’re asking about pre-marriage counseling or marriage counseling.I did pre-marriage counseling because of my husband’s (then-bf) persistence. Our counseling sessions were done with an older married couple who we are friends with. We didn’t have any curriculum or lesson plan, but our couple friend facilitated conversations about different aspects of marriage life. Eg, how we deal with finances, what our families were like and how this can possibly influence our marriage, potential issues with in-laws and boundaries. Stuff like that.I was initially damn averse to the idea of pre-marriage counseling. Thought it was a waste of time. But on hindsight, I think it the sessions helpful. The way I see it, the sessions were a relatively safe space to state our expectations and go into the marriage with our eyes open."
Pre. Haha but cannot change title after posted. Oops.
"Hello.The catholic chruch apparent runs an extremely good pre marriage course.Yes I know the church is religious, but the church also is used to non catholics attending. My colleague who is not catholic attended the catholic church course and the priest showed up sometime during the thing an expressly promised not to Baptise people by stealth (lol)."
Hhaha baptise people by stealth.. Take water gun and shoot at you ah?I consider la.. Cos we atheist and i scared church very traditional la will say what wives should listen to husband and serve husband that kind of thing then i die liao haha.
"The ""wives submit to your husbands"" stuff is definitely more protestant. I hear it a lot in protestant weddings (and I find it very uncomfortable), but never in a catholic one (which are comfortably boring).I'm atheist too, but former catholic, and maybe it's bias but I think the catholic church is the most chill of the Christian denominations.Baptism by water gun should be a thing"
"They won't, but the environment is still mildly unsettling. But I'm not sure you can join anyway if neither of you are Catholic"
"I went through it (atheist) and thought it was not bad as well. Quite comprehensive and less religious than I expected. That being said there's still a decent amount of religious content even though it's not direct. For example emphasis on natural family planning, couple sharing on how they abstained for 15 years because they weren't married yet (TMI yo).We got a fun elderly couple (late 60s) who regaled us with tales of how the the guy was horny all the time and it was hard for him to stick to NFP and they had a kid every time he couldn't control himself during unsafe periods.All in all, I think pre-marriage prep is extremely useful but in the end it's just an academic exercise.Many situations are easily resolved in theory but everything breaks down when you are confronted with reality. For example, you can agree to spend time with each others parents equally, contribute money and time equally, etc. However when your parents start complaining that time/money is not enough, when you perceive (accurately or not) that your partner is biased, is when your relationship will be tested."
For example emphasis on natural family planningEvery Sperm Is Sacred!
"This is kinda dumb.If you think about it NFP is encouraging you to have sex when your partner is not fertile, therefore you are sending your sperm to a pointless demise.If they are going to die pointlessly anyway why not send them to die elsewhere for the greater good? Like the inside of a condom, a sheet of tissue paper or an old sock."
"Well the thinking being NFP basically hearkens from a time when people had no real idea how babies were made, and that instead it was God doing some magic that caused sex to result into children. Ergo, best not to interrupt God when he is doing his thing.Now that we do know that it's sperm meeting eggs, and that there basically isn't a need for God to be monitoring the process. Unfortunately though I think the earlier mindset still lingers on."
hahaha natural family planning means not planning and leaving it to fate ah?
Means don't shoot inside ..
Nope. Shooting outside is a sin. Sperm is sacred!!1!1!!1
NFP is to follow along with the body cycles. Basically don't have sex when the woman is fertile if you don't want to have babies and vice versa.
"I believe this is more about trying to guesstimate the fertile period based on the menstrual cycle and ovulation. Dont have sex when you are most fertile, or pull out during this period. They claim it works quite consistently, but of course its just a guesstimate so not reliable especially if the woman's period is irregular. Catholics don't technically approve of contraception (God's will if you have children), but condoms or the pill are the most effective.My husband is Catholic so we had to go through this MPC, I rolled my eyes quite a bit, and I suffer every time I am obliged to go to church, which attests to my non-religiosity. They welcome people from all religions and atheists, and they do try to make it rather secular and cloak it in modern values somewhat, but I do remember there being the ""wives, listen to your husband and welcome all children from God, husbands, provide for your wife and kids"" stuff, God is the center of your marriage, you need to bring your kids up in a Christ-loving household etc. Your tolerance for this will depend on your general tolerance for religion, but ultimately marriage is between the two of you, so you can take the religious stuff with a grain of salt. Most of the other things are pretty non-religious, as others have mentioned (Communication, finances, discuss whether you want kids and when, discuss about parental duties). Take it as an opportunity to talk about what is important to you, discuss some of your assumptions, gain a better understanding of each other."
omg i would disagree SO MUCH. ok la i think i most likely will go for the secular ones maybe EMCC/touch community svc like others recommended. If i can convince my bf first.
"Nope, actually natural family planning works quite well if you follow it religiously (ha!) and have a pretty regular menstrual cycle.The main problem is that the prescribed method errs on the side of caution so you have a window of about a week every cycle for safe sex. 3 out of every 4 weeks without sex is hard to stomach for most. Unless you are the champion couple that held out for 15 years and then had 3-4 kids. Respec"

"If you look closely, the black-clad guy with the black cap on the extreme right is literally giving the finger as a pose which he somehow deems “cool”.

Gotta agree. Side by side as a memento that you've visited this place is still OK. The way those cunts standing on top and giving the finger is downright disrespectful. Solely for IG likes
Oh well influenzer disease

"On a smaller scale - Imagine you got something crafted / customized as a memento of someone who holds a high level of significance in your heart.In comes me, stepping on it while posing like Kurt tay and subsequently posting it on ig.Inappropriate or no big deal?"
feed them some tidepods
This 4 doofus. That monument was erected to remind the future generations that they fought and died so that we may live.
"Disrespect, no question.People died for us, the least you could do is not stand on their memorial. Go be cool somewhere else."
"Definitely disrespectful, but I wonder if these people even know the meaning of such memorials. I have seen people skateboarding at such places, is it their fault for not knowing? Or society's for somehow not educating them on the importance. If the later, then shaming these people online will have a purpose in highlighting why memorials are not to be used for Insta and FB likes..Damn, I sound like a uncle here . Getting old."
"The latter might be one good point - Singapore's education doesn't place emphasis on the members of the British Army who had died for the cause in the Battle of Malaya. For example, we all know about the sinking of HMS Repulse and Prince of Wales, but that's as part of highlighting the need for Singapore to be an independent nation. How many people knew about the British Army divisions that fought in Malaya? The 2nd battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders for example were incredibly valiant in defending Singapore - but you wouldn't have known that because our history books don't say that, and I didn't know that either and was under the impression that the British were a ragtag group defending the country, till I visited their museum in Stirling.During the withdrawal of the 11th Indian Infantry Division the 2nd Argylls slowed the enemy advance and inflicted heavy casualties on them. During these actions the battalion became so depleted by battle that it was ordered back to cross the causeway into Singapore. Two days later, an Australian staff officer in company with the 2000 or so men of the 22nd Australian Brigade (the absolute tail guard of the British forces) arrived at the causeway. He was amazed to find all 250 of the ASHR, the proud remnants of the whole battalion who had been in action almost continually since the Japanese invaded six weeks previously, camped on the Malay side of the water. When asked what they were doing still in Malaya when they could have been in the relative comfort of Singapore their commanding officer, Ian Stewart, replied ""You know the trouble with you Australians is that you have no sense of history. When the story of this campaign is written you will find that the ASHR goes down as the last unit to cross this causeway what's more – piped across by their pipers"". SourceWith only 250 men left, they even regrouped with Royal Marines which survived the sinking of the ships and formed the Plymouth Argylls, and fought for the island.It's true the British didn't focus on the battle on this front, but their home front was arguably under more severe threat from the Axis forces.There's also something else about the UK - almost every single town has a war memorial, as practically every city, town and village have been touched by WW1/2 in one way or another. They commemorate Remembrance Sunday every year on the Sunday closest to November 11th, and at 11am the whole country falls silent for two minutes. Big displays everywhere too - Glasgow has a whole ceremony complete with flag bearers of the old regiments and brigades, whilst Edinburgh's Legion Scotland division set up a memorial garden two weeks before the actual day and there would also be a large remembrance ceremony. In Singapore you get something on 15th Feb and that's it, could've missed it easily too."
"i agree. whether it was colonialism (singapore the eastern jewel of the british crown) or not, i have always felt that the men and women from the british empire defending singapore should be commemorated in a better manner than just a paragraph in ST at the remembrance service on 11 November."
Valiantly defending colonial land part of British empire.Which is probably why our history book skipped that part.
Uuuugh bet you they’re Gen Z....

"people were fine with that sook ching article earlier, cant say i see a difference here"
That was a scheduling thing that turned out to be an unfortunate coincidence. Does the average Singaporean know the significance of that date? I have to admit I didn’t.You telling me these guys inadvertently climbed a relatively familiar war monument with the words “our glorious dead” on it?
"its a pretty big stretch to assume perfect knowledge of all the actors involved, case in point kids ride the trafalgar lions all the time"
"And if they are wrong, would it be wrong for us to call them out on it?"
"One was an unfortunate coincidence that had no real malice, the other is just for the gram"

I bless the rains down in Singapore~~
Finally broke the spell of lots of dark clouds gathering but never actually raining
I'm looking forward to seeing green grass again.

But on a Monday morning though :(

I smell some haze tho hmm
You can thank me for finally washing my car on Saturday after one month

Except that it happened on the day before work
The cool rain can wash off some of the Monday blues at least
Perfect time to fall asleep in school

I am always so mad pissed at my sis for bathing so late at night for 4fucking5 mins like she completely doesnt understand the concept of saving water and letting me use the toilet to pee at night. And i cant do shit about it smh. Everytime i bang the door she takes a sweet damn time.
My sis can on the kitchen light n the toilet light to go toilet. 🙄
TIL humans can't talk. Else the problem would be solved by simple notification. Bro need to pee? Gonna bath now.O right. They can send WhatsApp. Maybe even read minds.Or maybe embrassed that can't hold it in for 45 minutes.Not sure what TIL.
5 mins is long? Uhm... Some ppl uses the hot water as a way to de-stress from the day. And can't you pee before she showers?
I’m pretty sure he meant 45 minutes.
Oh right! That would make more sense to his sense of rage. Thank you
HAHA yea i meant 45*mins my bad!

Library can be your safe zone. Go home only when your parents are tired or sleeping. They will have Low energy to shout at you and give up.
"Depends on where you stay then. The beach is an option. I usually walk to my nearest library, about 30 mins walk."
"Ah, I’ve been there so I can relate to how frustrated you must be feeling. Go to the gym, or a long walk/run. Meet your friends, y’all can plan outings or go to their places to hang. It depends on what you like but I think signing up for classes at the CC etc could be good too"
"Hi all, what are the chances of being accepted after the interview for temp jobs/events?"
Depends on the resume.
They never ask us to send resume tho? It’s just 2-3 days packer etc
"Ohh then it is usually first come first serve. If you're fast, very high"
Oh but they still asked us to go interview. Is it possible to really get rejected after the interview tho?
"Like you said, it's packing and all that. I'm assuming they are checking to make sure you fit their criteria, eg fit, can speak English, etc? And of course, it comes back to their headcount."
okay so apparently my parents digged even deeper into my phone and accessed my secure folder with my gf's scandalous stuff in it. is it possible for me to file a police report against them coz i think theyve crossed the line
This story is getting interesting. I just wish your parents is on reddit so they can share their side.
"How did they even manage to do that? You know they are snooping around your phone already so surely you must have changed your lock screen pattern or disabled the finger print sensor.Also how was the folder you mentioned ""secure""?This story sounds really bizzare so I'm just trying to make sense of it."
that was the 1st time my parents snooped around with my phone and the secure folder is protected by biometrics/pattern
"Generally police would not do anything thing about it cause it's family. And if you're doing that, you're pretty much prepared to live alone right? In that case, just move out."
"accessed my secure folder with my gf's scandalous stuff in it.Next time don't named your folder ""NOT sexy time with gf"""
i definitely do not name my folder that
"god damn, that sucks man. Did u tell your gf?"
yes she knows about it
"shit bro...messed up.... idk anything about filing a report but i wouldn't suggest u do such thing cos nothing good can wield out if it, but i would put up precautions and really have to speak to my parents about that shit because thats straight up disrespectful"

What are your thoughts on the proposal made by WHO to remove cannabis from the drug category and would it affect sg in any way
I think medicinal and even recreational use should be allowed. However recreational use should be heavily regulated to make sure safety standards of the marijuana strains sold are there. (E.g no artificial stuff) I don't think the Singapore government will ever allow it in the next 100 years. Even medicinal use also they stubborn how. I don't believe in the gateway drug bs and weed is a hell lot safer than cigs and alcohol

"So people have been lauding how QR codes are great for Hawkers to embrace cashless payments but I disagree. The user experience is just subpar. My school canteen supports cashless payments in this manner and it’s terrible.You open your bank’s app and scan a QR code.Then you key in the amount you want to payTap done.Wait a while.Then show the store owner.All while holding up the line. Whereas if it was the paywave standard, there’s less chance of user error and it’s faster: just hold your device against the reader, feel the haptic feedback and you’re done. All in less than 5 seconds flat. And it’s probably more secure too. What if there’s no mobile or wifi internet connection, you can’t pay but methods like Apple Pay, you still can.In my opinion, if retailers make it as easy as possible for consumers to part with their money, they will do so. And more at that.Edit: a word"
"the QR isn't fully in function yet. In time to come, it shouldn't require you to key in any amount. Scan and go. Still Beats fumbling my coins and all. I always use Apple Pay when possible though!"
"In time to come, it shouldn’t require you to key in any amount. Scan and goOh really? How would that work exactly? Will the code change according to amount payable?"
think of a live QR code that just keeps regenerating per order.
"NETS already offers a version of QR code payment that requires customer to input price of transaction and another version that does not require customer to input price of transaction. For the latter, it is because the vendor/stall owner will do the keying in of price. I heard there is a different pricing model for each version."
Oh. Seems like the first model is the one we’re using.
There are some places where they will print out the QR code on a small piece of paper and you scan the QR code and it’ll automatically deduct the exact amount. So it isn’t like a fixed QR code

Maybe he thought you interested in him?
hahaha even if he thought I was interested he doesn't have to act like this right
Some people act weird when they think someone is interested in them. Especially if he's interested as well.
wah don't get my hopes up leh :-((I'll definitely see him in school tomorrow cos we have a paper for the same module. idk where to throw my face LOL
Maybe try approaching him? You could make a new friend:)
How did he act weird?
when he and his friend came back from dinner and saw me (cos I was sitting near the entrance) he just mumbled sth to his friend while subtly pointing at me (I think?) and they both chuckledwhen I was standing up to go to the toilet I accidentally made eye contact with him thru the window reflection lol idkwas a bit hesitant to reply you cos you damn troll but meh

"Hi all,Joint Polytechnic Admissions Exercise (JPAE) is coming up soon.I am torn between SP's Infocomm Security Management and TP's Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics.Can anyone please share some insight to which I should choose? Thanks in advance!"
Have you considered NYP's Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics? I am a Y3 student from there and will be happy to answer any of your questions.
"I was from TP CDS, which is now known as some other course name and I think I'm qualified to answer your question because I have friends in NYP and SP who are from info security courses and Hwa Chong JC too, more on that later.Theres no real way to gauge which school is better because you wouldn't know until you have met the professors, but in my opinion I felt SP is way ahead than TP. If we are talking about how good the lecturers are in the field of infosec, afaik TP currently has only one who know his stuff well, so it'll be difficult to get into that class which is being taught by him and last I heard they are revamping the course structure and there will be some changes to the lecturers as well.If you are deciding on entering a school based on ctf wins, I can tell you it doesn't really matter as it is the skills that counts. Because every school has that one legend, who excels at that area and it changes every year and different School will have a chance in winning. I know of this friend who was from Hwa Chong, he swept all the competition clinching mostly first place, even outside of infosec (geeeeez), beating everyone even top local U's here (I'm not kidding, don't even know such people exists). My point is, just enjoy what you're doing and be good at it, Diploma only can teach you that much and to reach the next level, it is all about how much you want to learn during your time. To hell to those who looked at where you are from."
"I'm a Y3 TP Student. Won't tell you which to choose but I will tell you which Poly is the best.NYP's infosec courses, their students there are really one of the best among all the polys based on my interaction with their students etc and during certain competitions. They also have good partnerships with different companies and CSIT scholarship collaboration with them. But in the end, no matter which school you go, remember to take up certifications along the way during the holidays or when doing certain study modules that may have a related cert (E.g. CCNA for networking modules).Certifications are the best way to prove yourself to employers and are also what interviewers are also looking for."

"Hi, I am a potential first time pet owner. I wish to get a Syrian hamster for myself to take care for its lifetime. Like what do I need to do if I were to purchase/adopt from websites like gumtree? And if do I need to go thru AVA for pet owner certificate or smth?"
"hmm if you want an easier process try heading down to SPCA, they have hamsters for adoption as well and process is simple, not sure if they have Syrians. There’s a $10 adoption fee and apart from it that’s it. definitely encourage you to buy a hamster cage before adopting. As far as I know no you don’t need a pet owner certificate to get a hamster"
Well that's glad to hear! I'll see more into spca then. Thanks!
"I adopt from a local hamster group from fb, Syrian is must easier for newbie hamster owner, good luck in finding your new love of your life!"
Haha thank you! Is there any active grps where I can find them? Thx
"Nope. Just have to make sure you get a big enough cage for it, and it can’t be put with any other animal cause they will fight to the death. Min space for a Syrian is about 80cm x 40cm, and a ikea detolf cage is the best value for its size.It’s better if you adopt from Facebook hamster groups, and adopt when they’re young so it’s easier for the hamster to get used to you and they will be handled more which means lower chance of biting you.Source: Have 8 hamsters"
Alrights. Do you know of any active fb hamster grps? Mind dm-ing me if udm? Thanks!

does anyone have recommendations for durian delivery? my bro was looking at qoo10 which just seems like a terrible idea
FB: Hakeem’s Doyan Delivery
I've never ordered food from qoo10 but why is it a terrible idea? some of those stores have like 2k+ mostly positive reviews
Guess I've alway thought of the site as a place to buy products rather than food
no la quite reliable. i order kueh pie tee from redlips from there.
So has anyone tried KFC's Mac and cheese zinger
No. The mac and cheese part is disgusting. Better off getting regular Zinger
not worth the try 🤧 the bun doesn’t even taste like mac and cheese i’m so pissed zinger chicken is ok but too smalloverall is a 2/10
So so bad. The mac and cheese part is essentially the taste and feel of dry brownies with little cheese taste.
Tried yesterday. Was so jelak halfway. 2 ends is just heavily breaded deep fried macaroni and the middle is some cheese on top of zinger patty.

"HiMy landlord wants me to take a perform air-con servicing every three months. We have 4 air-cons in the house (1 in each bedroom and 2 in the living room). We live on the 12 the floor so get a lot wind and end up not using the aircon too much. When we need it, we both just shift to the bedroom so the living room aircon are barely used.The aircon company that my landlord recommended is quoting $400 for a yearly contract. I feel this is too much considering we already pay quite a high rent.What is a good time period to get the aircon serviced? How much should I be paying? Can my landlord keep my deposit if the air-cons are not serviced?"
3 month seems pretty standard and 100S$ per service of 4 units seems pretty reasonable. If you don’t use them you’d still want to service to avoid mold in the air your breath which can lead to some serious issues.
"Yearly is fine and chemical cleaning every 3 years is ok. Unfortunately in Singapore it’s sort of entrenched in the mindset that it has to be 3 months. Vendors standard package is also 3 months on a 1 year contract. Next lease opportunity, include it in the overall rent."
"Other than chemical cleaning which should be done once a year or slightly longer, you can actually clean the aircon yourself"
"As someone who is in a related field, I second what Jammy said.However u still gotta see whether the landlord accepts you doing cleaning yourself since most of the time they require proof (in the form of service chits) that the company doing the servicing will provide after each job is completed.(Also chemical cleaning is on an ad hoc basis and costs much more per unit)From my pov, based on your no. of units, $400 a year for quarterly servicing is relatively reasonable.You can go over to thegreenbook.com if u feel you'd rather get competitive quotes tho, else try to nego with the landlord."
Agree.
"I did this, every 3mth I cleaned myself what I could reach and then every 6mths a guy I know came and completely took it apart for complete cleaning. They guy wrote service records for every 3mth as required by lease.Even a/c not in use need to be cleaned since they collect dust and possible mould inside."
"General air-con servicing once every three months is a common standard for tenancy arrangements. $400 is quite high for a yearly contract. You can do one-off servicing for 4 units for about $90 or so, which amounts to slightly less than $400 a year. Why sign a contract where the company has less incentive to do a good job (since you cannot switch)?Don't do any extras like chemical cleaning and all that; those are expensive and should not be borne by the tenant."
Normally do six months. Three is overkill la. I use my aircon morning to night.
"Honestly, I have always done chemical cleaning as a reactive maintenance task rather than a preventative maintenance task. I've only done it when the unit fouls up completely and ices over."
This might go under unethical life pro tips but my cousin just got servicing receipts from Carousell to show her landlord and did cleaning herself mostly.
"Contact me ,ill link you up with my Ac guy Hes quite good and reasonable too!"

90% of the comments in that thread are just nationalist dick waving lol it's getting embarrassing at this point.Nice view though I guess.

"Any form of blind tribalism really (political, religious, nationalist etc). It's unbearable to watch.Like, I get it if we're comparing countries to learn how to improve our own, but for bragging rights? Childish."
"welcome downvotes, but i never knew singapore have nationalists oneedit: until now of course"
"There are a lot of them, trust me. Even in the thread u posted it was a singaporean who brought up nationality. I dont understand why they always love dick measuring contest with malaysia.Same applies for malaysian nationalists"
Every country have why so surprised?
We most certainly have them. As Reddit grows in public consciousness there'll be more of such people in r/Singapore; I already have a few marked in my RES to watch for signs of trouble.
Sorry mister ISD pls don't blacklist me
"There is good nationalism and bad nationalism, no need to try and paint it all as the same thing"
Patriotism =/= nationalism
"I know the difference. Still, there are good examples of nationalism. Plenty of them, in fact"
You should have no trouble explaining some of these examples then
"Prime example is the USA and it’s decades of working to undermine the Soviet bloc and now Russia. It wasn’t plain patriotism (supporting and advancing your own country’s interests) but active nationalism, ie overtly supporting your country’s interests to the detriment of another country’s interests). By and large, the US and most of the world is a better place because the US fought and largely won that battle. I’m no American apologist and of course there were plenty of selfish reasons for the US to do what it did but there were incredibly positive effects of that instance of overt nationalism which you and I continue to benefit from every day."
Singapore needs nationalism more than others because it holds the country of different ethnicity and culture together.
"The word you are looking for is patriotism, not nationalism"
This is basically everyone's excuse for nationalism.Why do we need to depend on being hostile to other countries in order to hold our own country together?
I had haemorrhoids from my eyes after reading that thread.
"the ""nationalist dick waving"" are mostly in the reply chain of a malaysian redditor talking shit about singapore.tit for tat"
"Actually he started by saying that the gardens were a tourist trap built by the government.It obviously is built by the government, and I actually do think it's a bit of a tourist trap (when's the last time you, a Singaporean, went there?)? The Botanics are free and are a far superior garden imo.But anyway sure you can disagree with him, but it was a Singaporean poster who replied throwing shit at Malaysia (there wasn't even an indication the OP was Malaysian to begin with), and the thread devolved from there.We need to have some class. Right now posts like these make singaporeans so desperately insecure and unable to deal with any critical views of our country."
"Precisely, I'm pretty sure its a bunch of teens that think it's ""edgy""."
Not really. You see how our Government reacts to media articles that give an unflattering assessment about Singapore (particularly on any human rights related issue). This is a wider cultural thing - Singaporeans just aren't very well equipped to deal with self criticism (especially if it's from a non-Singaporean).
"This is a wider cultural thing - Singaporeans just aren't very well equipped to deal with self criticism (especially if it's from a non-Singaporean).I couldn't agree more, I think that we're more likely to react first rather than think then react."
HI
That salty malaysian though 🤷🏻‍♂️
hilarious slapfight in the other thread.
"Lol yea on both sides somemore, tsk tskI guess all the recent mahatir dramas have incited a certain amount of nationalism"

I really need to visit there. that place looks so amazing.
You should.
"As a Singaporean, it's humid af, i've lived here for 26 years and I can't bear the heat and I sweat like a pig, if you were to visit, just make sure you come during the months which it's slightly colder, and by colder, I mean about 28-29°C/84°FEdit: here's 2 threads of Singaporeans talking about the hot and humid weather 🤣https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/arrf9y/after_a_whole_month_of_fucking_hot_weather_the/?utm_source=reddit-androidhttps://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/6a47n9/anyone_feels_the_current_weather_is_almost_too/?utm_source=reddit-android"

"Theres no seasons in Singapore, it's summer almost all year round, but I'd say the best time would be around January or December where it isn't as hot as usual, regardless, I'd suggest wearing sunscreen when you're outside 👍"

Fucking awesome place.

I'm sure it's nice but this isn't exactly peak urban planning
"I'm assuming you are not from Singapore, so to give a little more information, this picture is really only a very small area in Singapore and is purposefully designed as a tourist attraction. I would like to know what is considered good urban planning though, in your opinion.Hearing someone say that this is not good urban planning is quite new to me, since many of us in Singapore usually complain about how drab and uninspired most of our urban architecture is, with rows and rows of rectangular blocks lined side-by-side spread out across the country."
"Singapore is a biophilic city, which I believe is the height of urban planning. What you see in the photo is Gardens by the Bay, the most spectacular green engineering and design you would experience."
"Singaporean here, if you haven’t visited the place before I totally understand why it looks like poor urban planning. Cut this guy some slack!"
Come find out for yourself how we do urban planning in Singapore! (This is actually a legitimately interesting topic and we have whole galleries at our housing authorities dedicated to it). r/singapore welcomes you anytime.
"Women's rights are human rights. The struggle by women for justice and equality is one of the longest in the history of human rights.Although much progress has been made, the struggle is not over in some parts of the world.Boys and girls are born equal. Inequality sets in as they grow up.The causes are many, with history, religion and culture all playing a part.In the ancient world, women were treated as chattel. They could be bought or sold. Women had to marry the men chosen for them. They had no legal personality. They could not own property. They had no freedom of movement. Men's oppression of women is therefore an evil which has ancient roots.Religion has generally reinforced gender inequality with precepts and doctrines that subordinate women to men.Some Christian denominations bar women from the priesthood or leadership positions. In Islam, women face restrictions on leading public prayers. According to some Buddhist texts, women can attain Buddhahood only by first being reborn as men. In Hindu literature, women are sometimes depicted as being weak, sinful and irresponsible. The two religions which treat men and women equally are Sikhism and Baha'ism.Confucius taught that a daughter should obey her father, a wife her husband and a widow her son.Confucianism has had a pernicious influence on the status of women in Asia as it continues to influence the behaviour of men towards women in North-east and South-east Asia.The male chauvinist teachings of Confucius may be the reason why societies in these parts of Asia have such low fertility rates.COLONIAL SINGAPOREWhat was the situation in colonial Singapore? The British rulers of Singapore were all men.Reflecting the attitude back home, their attitude towards women was unenlightened.Professor Aline Wong, in her book Women In Modern Singapore, described the situation in colonial Singapore in the following way: ""The cultural traditions of the major ethnic communities in Singapore place a greater premium on the male compared with the female. Whether born as a Chinese, an Indian or a Malay, a woman is subjected to sociocultural and religious pressures to conform to the roles of wife and mother and to lead a secluded life.""Although several women's leaders such as Shirin Fozdar, Seow Peck Leng and May Wong had petitioned the British Governor and the British Parliament to abolish polygamy, their petition was rejected. Chinese men were free to have as many wives and concubines as they wished.Women occupied an inferior status during British rule.In 1877, the British Government established the Chinese Protectorate. Its objective was to look after the needs of the Chinese community. To its credit, the protectorate did try to tackle the problem of the trafficking of women and girls for prostitution.They also tried to ensure that the sale of young girls to rich families as mui tsai was not a form of slavery.WOMEN'S CHARTER OF 1961In its early days, the People's Action Party (PAP) was a revolutionary party. In 1959, it campaigned for the policy of one man, one wife. In 1961, the Singapore Government enacted the Women's Charter. It was nothing less than the Magna Carta for women in Singapore.What are the most important provisions of the Women's Charter?• First, it abolished polygamy for all non-Muslim men and required that all future marriages be registered.• Second, a married woman could continue to use her own name.•Third, husband and wife were treated as equal partners in a marriage.• Fourth, women had the right to own, buy and sell property.• Fifth, the Charter safeguards the rights of women in matters relating to marriage and divorce.• Sixth, the Charter also protects the right of the wife to matrimonial assets, maintenance and the custody of children.THE PAP AND WOMENIn the 1950s and 1960s, the PAP had several women leaders such as Chan Choy Siong.It was a pro-woman party.However, by the 1970s and 1980s, the PAP no longer had any women in its leadership. The party drifted away from its origin and became anti-women. Let me cite three examples to support my point.Quota for women in medical schoolIn 1979, the Minister for Health, Dr Toh Chin Chye, announced that women would be restricted to one-third of the intake for medical school. This unreasonable discrimination against women was abolished only in 2003.Lower admission requirements for male studentsIn 1983, the National University of Singapore modified its entry requirements for male students.Why? In order to prevent any imbalance in the sex ratio in favour of women. Speaking in justification of this discrimination, the NUS vice-chancellor, Professor Lim Pin, said that a gender imbalance in the university would only aggravate the ""problem of having unmarried graduate women"".Home economics not for boysIn 1984, the Ministry of Education stopped all Secondary 1 and Secondary 2 girls from taking technical studies. Henceforth, all girls had to study home economics and the boys had to take technical studies."
"THE UNITED NATIONS' POSITIVE INFLUENCESome foolish people think the world would be better off without the United Nations.Without the UN, we would not have the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and, most importantly, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (Cedaw).Cedaw was adopted in 1979 and came into force in 1981. Singapore became a party to the Convention in 1995.Article 16 of Cedaw requires all state parties to eliminate discrimination against women in all matters relating to marriage and family matters.What are the rights of women protected by Cedaw? First, the right to freely and consensually choose her spouse. Second, to have personal rights to her children even in the event of divorce. Third, the right of a married woman to choose a profession or occupation. Fourth, to have property rights within marriage.Before leaving the subject of the UN, I would like to acknowledge the important contributions which a Singaporean, Dr Noeleen Heyzer, the former executive director of the UN Development Fund for Women, has made.In 2000, Dr Heyzer succeeded in persuading the UN Security Council to adopt Resolution 1325.The resolution calls on states to safeguard the rights of women and girls in armed conflict.Judge Navanethem Pillay of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said: ""From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as one of the spoils of war. Now it is a war crime. We want to send out a strong message that rape is no longer a trophy of war.""STATUS OF WOMEN IN SINGAPOREHave Singapore women succeeded in achieving justice and equality with men? I think it would be fair to say that in most important respects, women have achieved equality with men.Our women have achieved parity with men in education at all levels. Women's participation in our workforce is at about 60 per cent but there is still a wage gap between men and women.Women outlive men. Most glass ceilings impeding the rise of women in Singapore have been broken. We have a woman as our President. We have several very capable woman ministers, permanent secretaries, judges of the Supreme Court, CEOs of statutory boards and leading corporations.The only two areas which need improvement are the number of women in Parliament and the under-representation of women on corporate boards and in senior decision-making positions.The world has recognised the tremendous progress which women in Singapore have achieved in the past 50 years.In 2016, the UN Human Development Report ranked Singapore No. 11 out of 159 countries on its Gender Inequality Index. In 2017, the US News and World Report published a list of the 23 best countries in the world for a woman to live in. Singapore was ranked No. 22.CONCLUSIONWomen's quest for justice and equality has made tremendous progress in the past few decades.In Singapore, women have largely achieved parity with men. The Singapore Council of Women's Organisations and the Association of Women for Action and Research should be acknowledged for their pivotal role in fighting for equal rights.Singapore has become one of the world's most women-friendly countries. However, women in some other parts of the world are not so fortunate.They are still treated as second-class citizens and continue to live under the oppression of men.The struggle is not over.• Professor Tommy Koh, a veteran diplomat, is chairman of the Centre for International Law and rector of Tembusu College, both at the National University of Singapore."

Thank you for posting this educational and enlightening read.

"Actually, I think that in Singapore these days, it's the other way round. Both genders are granted equal opportunities but women enjoy additional rights and protections by law.Up until the most recent revision it was not even possible for men to be considered rape victims. Women don't have to serve NS. They get significantly more maternity benefits and alimony during a divorce. They get the automatic benefit of the doubt in any claim of outrage of modesty or physical assault between a man and a woman.Our society is at a weird point where the progressive women rights and empowerment from the west is embraced, yet it still holds very traditionalist views and biases on how a man should be the main provider for the family and the women are to be vehemently protected.Edit: I've written a very controversial comment about this before. Much of Reddit doesn't agree but I think Singaporeans tend to be more empathetic because they can relate (especially about NS)."
"I think a lot of the perceptions of sexism and equality is framed in a ""who gets the shorter end of the stick"" manner, trying to count or weigh who gets the better ""deal"" overall, and then concluding whether society is fair or sexist against men or women. To be honest, there is no need to tally points on which gender is enjoying more rights. No one wins the sexism game, it affects us all negatively in different ways.A lot of the more ""subtle"" cultural sexism actually has a pervasive influence on our lives and society. As u/pingmr stated, women are still expected to take up majority of the household work, and they face more pressure from families to focus on their kids and the housework (anytime a kid screws up in life, people automatically blame the mother; I admit to having to catch myself on this on occasion as well). Anecdotally, I've had older male relatives (mid-40s) tell me that women are not suited to be leaders (managers or higher) in organizations because they should be more focused on child rearing, because they do not have the mental and emotional acuity for leadership etc. With older males largely occupying our leadership positions, this is going to influence women's opportunities for promotion, greater work responsibilities, and higher salaries compared to men. When it comes to caregiving then, it makes financial sense for women to give up their jobs to take care of kids/elderly than men, reinforcing the stereotype of the male breadwinner who is less invested in the kids/family, and women as the career-sacrificing, family-oriented caregivers. These warped perceptions of gender roles are a double-edged sword... There are people who shame men for putting their families first at the expense of their career (and also blame their wives if men were to sacrifice work for family). I believe no one would lament giving fathers more paternity leave, and mothers would definitely appreciate having their husbands around particularly in the first two months of giving birth, but even if the law catches up on this by increasing paternity leave (by how much is hypothetical right now), these ridiculous cultural notions may not allow for men to take their full leave entitlement. Even in the UK and US (the supposed paragons of Western progressiveness), where men have a bit more paternity leave (a UK colleague mentioned recently her husband has 4 months of paternity, and I believe some US companies provide 8 weeks compared to the pittance of 2 weeks Singaporean men get), men are shamed for taking paternity leave and wanting to spend time with their families (Source). It's no longer a matter of whether there is equality on paper, as long as these sexist sentiments persist, no one wins. Were society's views on gender roles at home and at work more balanced, we would see more men in a caregiving role and more women putting their careers first, and no one is judged for their choice. If anything, I would argue that Singapore has been trying to be more progressive on the part of gender roles in the family, with the Dads for Life movement, greater recognition of the role of fatherhood, but a lot of the older mentality has to change.Maternity/Paternity leave aside, how many of the unfair examples you mentioned can be attributed to sexism? the rape/sexual assault laws you mentioned are likely a result of several things: 1. men having more power in society and hence over women (this has been resurfacing plenty in the MeToo movement in the west). 2. Sex-shaming: Women are not supposed to want sex, men only think with their penises. This cultural perception means that women who are assaulted would be too ashamed to admit that they have been a victim of assault. After all women are supposed to maintain purity/virtue and being raped (lets be honest just even having sex before marriage) is being spoiled for their future partners etc. This cuts both ways again, as men just ""cannot be"" rape victims! Thankfully the law on this has changed, but again this traditionalist mindset is coloring many peoples' opinions when it comes to rape (male or female). NS obligations are the most complicated issue... but again I'd wager that this stems from the traditional mindset that men are soldiers, women are child bearers. Putting aside conscription (whether boys or girls both should spend two years of their lives in the military is up for debate), I know girls who wanted to join or did join the military, served BMT etc, and they have faced stiff opposition and snide remarks from relatives and acquaintances ""why so tomboy, later no one want to marry you"", ""ah girl, you sign-on army then how to have kids"". And I am only speculating on this point but I wonder whether the notion that women should be having kids (before their fertility is up oh dear) plays a role in why women are not required to enlist. This is benevolent sexism that apparently benefits girls (most girls dont do NS after all), but I would like more girls to be able to choose this path without the shaming from others (again I am purposefully ignoring conscription here). I think the mentality on girls in the military is changing, partly since we need the manpower.The ideology of feminism is often tainted by perceptions of ""feminazis"", but it's really not about achieving female superiority. It's about equality, recognizing that many cultural values negatively affect both men and women, and wanting to elevate the supposedly ""feminine"" and ""inferior"" qualities, compassion, emotionality, caregiving to be seen as equal to the ""masculine"" and ""superior"" characteristics, assertiveness, leadership, etc. (in fact these qualities should not even be gendered). Why should men who are in touch with their emotions and families be shamed for being soft or girly (why is girly even an insult?)? Why should women who aspire to be leaders and trailblazers be attacked for putting their career first? True equality can only come when societal perceptions of gender and gender roles changes, and this should not be a fight to see who gets more benefits."
"Absolutely this. You took the words (and more) right out of my mouth :)Indeed, it’s an oversimplification but to the original commenter’s point, these official measures which seem to make life easier for women are basically to compensate for systemic and cultural/unsaid disadvantages (like the societal pressures mentioned) that women face in the first place.Beyond overt gender discrimination, they are to make up for unconscious biases and blind spots in our society. For instance, men often hire and promote other men, or take other men more seriously, not because they are maliciously sexist but because people tend to gravitate towards similar people and/or feel they “just get along better”. But the by-product of this is leaving women behind, even if that was not the intention. And that is what these policies are trying to break the cycle of.When issues like this fly under the radar especially of the people who perpetuate them subconsciously, the official policies that seem “pro-women-anti-men” become the most visible line in the sand. Which is why it is too easy to think “oh women just have it so much easier than men nowadays”."
Hear hear!
"I really enjoyed reading this comment, so have my little up vote.My personal favorite example of how we live in a sexist society/culture is""What's the male equivalent of a ""slut""?""The closest thing I can think of right now is man-whore but that's a term that caught on fairly recently. Meanwhile words like slut, harlot, hussive, strumpet, painted lady, woman of ill repute, all speak to how historically sexually promiscuity in women has been viewed far more negatively than sexual promiscuity in men.You also illustrate why it's a bit weird to complain about NS on this issue. NS is part of and a cause of the problem that results in women getting certain expectations placed on them. The current system isn't going to include women in NS even if women wanted to."
"Thanks! that's a great example, the only other term I can think of is ""Player"" but that sometimes has a tinge of admiration, not so much the shame and scorn associated with ""slut"". I've also seen ""Fuckboy"", but that's also not shaming a guy for having many sexual partners, more condemning the way he treats his sexual partners.I guess the G is facing a bit of a no-win situation here, removing conscription would mean the number of volunteer soldiers plunging dramatically, placing national security at risk, conscripting girls will basically be handing people a loaded gun when it comes to increasing our crappy fertility rate, and we all know the drawbacks and arguments against mandatory conscription for males, so the status quo sucks too."
NS is part of and a cause of the problem that results in women getting certain expectations placed on them.So NS is unfair to women now. Wow.
"I mean, if you want to read my comment without any regard to context just so you can be upset, go ahead.Why can't NS be unfair to everyone? Men are forced to serve, and then are told that they are serving to protect their women who are at home. Women have no option to serve for just two years even if they wanted to, and have to operate in a society where every man (well the Singaporean ones) has been told in their formative years that it is their job to protect ""the women at home"".NS being exclusively male is a clearly a product of the same thinking that went into the Women's Charter when it says that men are not eligible for maintenance. I.e. Men are protectors who need to care for women, and women need to be cared for.So if you complain about the Women's Charter being sexist or adopting an outdated view of men having to provide for women, then why isn't this same critique being applied to NS?"
"Men are forced to serve, and then are told that they are serving to protect their women who are at home. Women have no option to serve for just two years even if they wanted to, and have to operate in a society where every man (well the Singaporean ones) has been told in their formative years that it is their job to protect ""the women at home"".And men have no option to not serve for two years even if they didn't want to. Which anyone with a brain would agree is much worse.NS being exclusively male is a clearly a product of the same thinking that went into the Women's Charter when it says that men are not eligible for maintenance. I.e. Men are protectors who need to care for women, and women need to be cared for.NSFs are told on the first day of BMT that they are there to train to protect the country, not just the female citizens. That's what I was told too. You need to check your facts."
"And men have no option to not serve for two years even if they didn't want to. Which anyone with a brain would agree is much worse.I think I already acknowledge this when I say ""Men are forced to serve"" so I don't know why you are yelling my own points back at me.NSFs are told on the first day of BMT that they are there to train to protect the countryIf all the male citizens are in NS and also defending the country, then just who are the remaining citizenry who are being defended? Mostly the women. In any event you are putting up a straw man here - the point I'm making goes further than ""what the OC told me on the first day"", it's about the entire NS experience, where you are constantly told about defending girlfriends, wives, and so on. It's about the perpetuation of the idea that ONLY men are generally suited to defend, which is why men are conscripted. Some women can sign on, but they are the exception, not the rule.This goes back to my comparison to the Women's Charter - people complain about how it thinks that women have to be protected by men, but few see the obvious relationship to NS, a social institution that basically reinforces this thinking, by force.You need to check your facts.And I think you might need to reread the post above. Sexism is not a zero sum issue where men and women can only be more equal at the expense of the other group. The fact that women face discrimination in society is not negated because men suffer in NS. NS is unfair to everyone. If you want to go further to insist that MEN SUFFER MORE, sure go ahead, but honestly that point does not add very much to the discussion on sexism in Singapore - like I said, NS is part of the problem that everyone is facing."
"Putting aside conscription (whether boys or girls both should spend two years of their lives in the military is up for debate),Lol why would you put aside the single biggest obstacle to gender equality in Singapore just because it doesn't fit the 'girls have it bad :(' rhetoric? And it extends way beyond 2 years too, with passport restrictions, exit permit requirements, IPPT, ICT, etc.I know girls who wanted to join or did join the military, served BMT etc, and they have faced stiff opposition and snide remarks from relatives and acquaintancesI promise you, these are nothing compared to the remarks and hate that NSFs face. Just go look on social media, you have women posting up pictures of guys to shame them for sitting on transport, eating at restaurants, and doing absolutely nothing harmful to anyone."
"I tried to make it very clear in my comment that we should not make this into a ""who gets it worse"" pissing contest.Can we not acknowledge that societal expectations of gender are just bullshit in general, and then work to fix that? Why do you have to insist that men get it worse BECAUSE OF NS!11!!!11111!! I am not complaining about women having it worse, as there is no measure of what kind of societal shaming is worse, and there doesn't need to be one. Is it ONLY women being dicks about what NSFs do in public? Please don't blame all women for the actions of a few idiots online. I don't know about what kind of hate you have faced as an NSF, and I do not wish to compare my experiences with yours because your experiences are as real and important to you, as mine are to me. I in no way wish to belittle the pain and burden and sacrifice that NSFs go through, and am not one of these idiots you mention. All I ask is that we try to understand each gender's perspective, acknowledge how sexism is nasty to all, and to try and make the world a better and more equal place for ourselves and our children.I put aside the idea of CONSCRIPTION, because I don't think that anyone should be forced to serve the military against their wishes, girl or boy, and I think they should be free to choose whether they want to join the military or not. All I was trying to do was to highlight how a gendered society resulted in men having to unfairly shoulder majority of the military burden (which supports your belief that the existing male-only conscription is skewed?). If society was fair and non-sexist, men and women would both serve in a more balanced proportion. If female conscription was to be a reality, and if I had a daughter, I would embrace it as best as I could, same as if I had a son. Even if there were no conscription at all, and my hypothetical child wished to serve, I would wholeheartedly support their decision.I am not your enemy here, even if you seem to only pick the one complicated point to enforce your ""boys have it bad :("" rhetoric."
"I tried to make it very clear in my comment that we should not make this into a ""who gets it worse""We are talking about gender equality here. That's the whole premise behind equality.I put aside the idea of CONSCRIPTION, because I don't think that anyone should be forced to serve the military against their wishes, girl or boy,If female conscription was to be a reality, and if I had a daughter, I would embrace it as best as I could, same as if I had a sonI would love to live in your hypothetical fantasy world too. But in the real world. conscription exists, and only for males. Why do you conveniently switch between the current state, and what should be the case when talking about ways in which males are severely disadvantaged? You should compare apples to apples instead."
"That's the whole premise behind equality.No dude. What you are doing is engaging in some sort of ""inequality Olympics"" to see who has it worse, and therefore the ""better off"" person has no basis to complain.This was literally preempted by u/me-Aw when he/she stated right up front that ""To be honest, there is no need to tally points on which gender is enjoying more rights. No one wins the sexism game, it affects us all negatively in different ways.""Like I mentioned earlier, if you want to come in here and adopt your rather idiosyncratic definition of gender equality just so you can be angry on the internet, then this is really just you getting angry at yourself because neither of us are engaging in this ""girls have it bad :("" rhetoric that you think is going on."
"Dude you need to read what is being said, particularly since no one is against your primary position that NS is skewed unfairly against males. You seem to be insisting on picking a fight and only focusing on the NS domain because to you, that is the burden men face and it is the ""worse"" burden and therefore the only burden that needs to be discussed. I have acknowledged the unfairness of the current situation with respect to NS and what I think should be a more equitable outcome. I hope you one day are able to see others' perspectives. Good day to you."
"I work in a pretty high performance industry, and I can share that I think your analysis is incomplete.Women are still expected to be the primary care givers to children and/or home makers, this is also why they are given more maternity benefits (well, in addition to the fact that they actually deliver the child, so I think it's should be obvious that they might need a bit more rest than the dad). As a result of this social expectation, women have a tough time progressing to the highest positions in a company since they face social pressure to instead be at home and spending time with the children and/or cleaning the house. Men on the other hand face no such pressure.In a very competitive industry, these differences count. If you can focus 100% on the work (as a man), while a woman has to do so while worrying about kids (etc), the man is going to perform better. And where the industry is competitive, even small differences matter a lot.As for the rest of your points:> Up until the most recent revision it was not even possible for men to be considered rape victims.Technically wrong. Men still can't be raped unfortunately. They can be victims of sexual assault now.> Women don't have to serve NS.This is true, but I see this more as a general conscription issue, rather than women enjoying additional rights under the law. If you think NS should not be conscription based, then that's a big point that can be discussed on its own.> They get significantly more... alimony during a divorce.This is not wholly accurate. The current way in which maintenance is distributed is based on financial need/ability. The Courts have denied women maintenance where the judge felt that the wife did not need maintenance since she had sufficient income capacity on her own.I say ""not wholly accurate"" because it is true the men (mostly) cannot apply for maintenance, and that maybe (since men generally will earn more) it is more generally the case that women are dependent on their husband's income.> They get the automatic benefit of the doubt in any claim of outrage of modesty or physical assault between a man and a woman.This is completely false. Criminal law is pretty clear on this - the prosecution has to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. No case will be successful if the prosecution relies on ""the benefit of the doubt""."
"I will concede the last point - you might be right that legally women don't get 'the benefit of the doubt' insofar that the law prosecutes them differently. Perhaps it's more or a social stigma, where a large portion of society automatically put the blame on the guy in these situations.Also, I don't want to be presumptuous, but I dare say that much of the general public would take the claims of a woman being groped on the train much more seriously (cries of outrage) compared to if it were a guy (indifference / pity)."
"Well I do feel it is presumptuous to make that general conclusion.For all the possible groped on train scenarios, you also see plenty of victim blaming on women for wearing too little, inviting attention, and so on. I actually have not personally seen a man being ""automatically blamed"" in the way you are illustrating."
"Hmm. I felt that the way they stated where Singapore can improve on is a little... weird. Should we be aiming for more women in senior decision making positions and the government? Or should we focus on removing barriers? I think we should focus our efforts on the root cause rather than focusing on the outcome.Overall though, interesting article. A lot of the history were new to me."
"We shouldn't be aiming on having more women in senior decision making positions and in government. We should be aiming for COMPETENT people in decision making positions and gvt. Sex doesn't matter - a person's competency and ability in a given position is far more important than any biological marker. I don't think the issue is barriers too - after all, we currently have a woman in one of the highest possible positions that can be held in government, the presidency (whether or not the position holds power is a different matter). We don't need to address the issue of putting women in senior and decision making positions, we need to ask ourselves if women are applying for these positions, and if not, why not?"

Hi allI'm off to Singapore for the first time in a long time next week. I've booked a couple of fine dining restaurants and just wondering what the dress code is for fine dining in Singapore?
Smart Casual should be fine. So a pair of jeans + covered shoe and a shirt would suffice
Could you give the names of the restaurants?It varies widely.
"Odette and Les Amis. The kind of places I'd normally wear a suit to dinner, but not sure if a jacket is needed and I'd be fine in shirt and pants."
"You won't be out of place with a jacket, but it's not necessary. Shirt and pants would be sufficient.Enjoy!"
Odette is really nice though. I think jacket is ok for dinner while button down shirt or even polo is ok for lunch.
"Odette has no dress code, Les Amis requires smart casual. But in general, if you're gonna feel bothered if you're underdressed, then throw on what you think is appropriate. I'd defo go in a jacket sans tie for both"
"Thanks for responding, I think I'd feel under dressed without a jacket, particularly at 2 Michelin starred french restaurants. i'll make sure to pack one."
"You really wouldn't be under dressed at all, it's Singapore. Dress for the climate here.When Joel Robuchon (3 stars) was still around in Singapore, it wasn't uncommon to see other tourists in tshirt/polo and pants.Fine dining restaurants here are considerate of the weather, the standard no-nos are just sandals/slippers or shorts.If you really want to wear a jacket though, that's fine. There's always some people who dress up for dinner, usually date nights or whatever."
"I've been to a few in Singapore, Les Amis included, and I usually just wear chinos and a shirt."
"Went to odette, they reminded the dress code is smart casual. Well as long as you aren't in flip flops and tank tops you should be fine."
"Shirt and pants is fine. Been to both, some people dress real fancy, others smart casual. My brother wore khaki shorts and a shirt to odette-underdressed but he wasnt kicked out nor did they mention anything about it(he wasnt expecting it to be that fancy)."
You’d be fine in a shirt and pants at Odette and Les Amis. A jacket would be nice (especially at Les Amis) but they won’t refuse you entry without a jacket. Enjoy!
"Honestly think that guys just need to avoid sports wear/singlet, even shorts, tshirt should be fine. Slippers might be pushing it abit though. This might seem strange to you only because you're not Singaporean."
"Personally, a jacket would be overkill if it's just dinner. If it was some occasion then yeah, otherwise I stick to smart casual."
"For men, shoes no sandals or slippers, shirt and jeans/pants should be fine. Some places will take you in shirt and berms but to be safe jeans or pants.For women, most things are fine as long as you don’t look like you’re coming from the swimming pool or the wet market. A dress and shoes or heels are very safe bets."
"Singaporeans don't dress up much. Go into a fancy steakhouse for a $200 steak and watch uncles in tshirts, jeans and sandals...Really fine-dining (Michelin star and all) will be a bit more buttoned-up but nothing extraordinary."
"That's a not very fancy steakhouse then... Higher end restaurants usually won't allow sandals/slippers or shorts.Even at fine dining ones, t-shirt and pants or jeans with shoes is fine. No need for a button down shirt."

So I will be a fresh grad working in his first job soon. I have secured a job and will earn approx 3.5k a month. How much should I contribute to the house? I was thinking of $500 but my mum is asking for 1k. I feel that is too much? Thoughts? How much did you guys contribute from your first job? Percentages would be helpful as well.
"1k is probably too much, unless of course 1k is also considered paying off your university fees which your mum paid for you."
Children shouldn't give money to their parents. Parent's work so that their kids can have what they could not. Their children's job is to provide for their own children.. money flows downwards.
are you saying this as a parent?
As a parent and a son
"oh..Well, just speaking as a son, I think I'm responsible for making sure that my parents have enough to stay alive. After all, they gave up so much for me.About providing for my own children.Of course, I will provide for them! But, well, my parents are alive now, children are non-existent, I should take care of them first and not any potential children down the line.If I do have both, I hope I can take care of both at once.Just a personal opinion here ( probably unrealistic ) but I think one really should have their finance ready before having children. Everyone can sorta choose when to have kids so to have them when you aren't ready... well, that is just going through life in Hell Mode."
"Exactly, if you have kids when financially ready, your kids won't need to support you. Anyhow, most of the ppl is doing just well in Singapore, they don't live paycheck by paycheck and they don't need their children's money to survive. For them to ask their kids for money is just greedy."
"Ehh... not so?I'm 25.. dammit, 26 this year and I think for people of my generation, our parents are those that grinded hard instead of smart to get us to where we are.My parents often say that for most old folks now, their retirement plans are their children as they have gone all in from the beginning.Of course lah, this kind of self destructive behavior should stop at this point liao so that's why I will agree that I shouldn't need my children's money to survive.But my parents, and those that gone all in, different case leh."
"Fair enough, just plan so you don't make the same mistake as your parents so your kids can have a fresh start"
"Makes sense, but whichever generation starts implementing this gets sandwiched. Might be more feasible if transition happens over more generations."
It should have been many generations ago
"Honestly, if you are a grown up and have a job and still live with your parents, which is quite common in Singapore, very uncommon where I'm from, you should contribute towards the rent and food you consume at home. If you don't like it, then move. Once you move away from home, the parents should live off there own money for the rest of their lives and don't expect hand outs."
Pretty sure u’re picked up
Yea this
I agree. thats where the confusion lies. If she wants me to pay for my uni fees I would of course oblige. But she didnt put it that way.
"I’m in the same boat as you are. My parents are really frugal so i’m not worried about the money, but after giving them 1k for 2 years i asked them what they did with the money they told me they’ve saved it in the bank. Managed to convince them to invest it after much persuasion. I’m an only child though so maybe your situation could be different."
Well...from how you phrased it she paid for your uni in full? Then 1k per month isn't that much.
"Started with 4k, (forced to give) 1.2k that went towards helping to pay for house loan, utilities, food etc etc. Always found the amount too high, but they have a million and one ways to justify the need, and I figured if I were to rent a room elsewhere, it’s going to be way more expensive."
"But in the future if you decide to buy your own flat, will you have to give them allowance?"
"I intend to reduce what I give out, but I fear I'd be paying even more by then in the guise of hospital bills because they aren't covered by any insurance policies. Distrust of agents they said. By the time I realised those implications, they were past 60 and their premiums were already ridiculous."
Two parents without health insurance policies? These are the kind of things which bankrupt people in Singapore - high medical costs.
You can still purchase the insurance.Health policy premiums are tiered by age anyway. You lost nothing by not having bought it earlier unless the insured developed conditions that will be excluded.
Which is usually the case in old age.
But not necessarily.
Their million and 1 excuses to guilt you has now placed you in a precarious financial position. You’re well within your right to guilt them to pay for their own health care. You need to look out for your future (and your wife/kids?) too. Still sounds like they treat you as their income generating asset with little thought to your future.
I too will have to help pay house loan in the future when I graduate. GGWP
Wah high paying first job?
"You need to talk with yr parents. My ex gf gave 50% to her parents, spending 30% and only saving 20% as her own savings. When she got married, the parents returned her everything that she passed to them."
To be still good friends with this type of conversations with your ex gf you must be blessed.
"well, maybe his ex gf is his now wife. 😆"
"Maybe his gf back then told him all these things in confidence, and he's now divulging confidential information now that she's his ex just to be a dick.Plot twist."
Working full time and studying part time.I earn $1600. I know its not a lot compared to the rest of the other redditors. I give $200 every month or more whenever I can give.
"It's the thought that counts. Kudos to you, I remember when I started working and earn <2k, I didn't give my mum a single cent (maybe once in a year) :x"
Gross or nett?
gross
Too much . Anything more than 1/3 of your salary is ridiculous . General rule of thumb is 1/4ish at max . So if u earn 3.5k ~~800 bucks should be fine .Living in SG is expensive man . Renting a house and your 3.5k 50% gone already.Edit : so many triggered mums out here downvoting . Chill out I do pay my fair share to my parents .
"I don’t see a reason to downvote. You already stated ~~800 bucks should be fine. To me 800 bucks is too much. There are way to many factors to consider for one to put a blanket percentage of how much to give your parents a month. It depends on whether you still stay with your parents, and how are your parents doing financially (i.e. whether they are still working or not). If you don’t live with your parents and they are still working then I don’t see a reason why you should be giving anything beyond 10-20% of your income (as a token of goodwill)Filial piety should not be measured in monetary terms. There are so many other ways to show filial piety like bringing your parents overseas, ensuring that their bills are accounted for and that they are getting the best value for their money for the plans that they are signing up for, etc. If your parent is flat out asking you for a lump sum I think that there’s something inherently wrong"
Edit : so many triggered mums out here downvoting . Chill out I do pay my fair share to my parents .There shouldn't be a need to justify to the world even if you don't give your parents money. It's your own personal matter anyway. This is why sg society is so toxic.
"At the end of the day , the singaporean society is largely Asian conservative with deeply rooted Confucius values like filial piety . I feel like there is this underlying obligation that we must all repay our parents in the future . Our society is unlike the westerners, as I’ve seen first hand during my education overseas . Basically , once a kid turns 18 , they basically fuck off and make a family for themselves and parents have little or no control of their actions . So in that instance I see that there is no obligation for them to do what we do . Likewise , we stay still we get our first job and move out when we graduate / stable income to rent a room.Just my thoughts . At the end of the day , it’s still your choice if you want to repay with your monthly salary to your parents . I’ve been fortunate enough for a good upbringing, it’s just my due respect for them ."
"If you're staying at home in any culture you ought to contribute to the costs. However I've not understood the point in sending money to parents just for the sake of it/if they don't need it. That's just pointless - especially if you live somewhere with taxes on the estate, as you'll end up wasting money once they die and gift it back to you anyway."
"Confucius say, finding old man in dark, not hard.""Just a bot trying to brighten up someone's day with a laugh. | Message me if you have one you want to add."""
Yeah I think its too much as well. I need to reason with her before I start work otherwise things might get ugly. thanks for the reply!
Contribute only what can you afford. Don't give 'em everything and end up eating cup noodles at the end of the day.
So many parents used kid as a investment like the kid choose to be born.

LMFAO
"I mean it depends... you should set your priority on your future first, and then decide how much you want to give your parents. What i meant is you have to save up for your future, and 1k/3.5k is a pretty huge portion.I would say 500 is already very good for a fresh grad. You should also take into consideration of whether do you have to pay off the tuition fee loan etc etc."
Yes 500 is what i'm thinking as well. I dont have loans to pay off but I would like to save up a decent amount as well for post grad studies etc. Thanks for the advice!Edit: grammar
Your parent paid for your studies?
Yes they did. Which might be cause for them to ask for this much. But my mum isnt saying this is for paying for my education but instead she puts it as household contribution.
"I think now you should have a talk with your parents. Tell them you intend to save up first before giving them more allowance? You are already 26k ahead of most people, maybe this will make you feel better!"
True I think it should get this sorted with them asap before things turn nasty. Thanks!
Hope things goes well for you :)
How did you get 26k number?
Cost of 4 year uni study I guess
so cheap
For singaporeans. Not cheap for poor people like me
"$1k for household contribution sounds very excessive, unless your mom is buys like organic bananas for $10 each or something ridiculous."
Downvote away but IMO it's an outdated and ridiculous cultural norm. Especially when the marginal value of each dollar is usually worth much more to the children compared to parents who should be more established. Give them money if you want to or they need it.
Its about acknowledging the cost of adulthood.If the young adult is still living at home then there is every expectation they should pay their fair share. Go rent a room elsewhere if not happy.
"Depends on your parents' financial status. In extreme circumstances, I know some parents spent a chunk of their savings to pay for their kids' university education then yeah you might have to give more.In general, since you just started working, offer to pay the utility bills and other misc stuff to start off with. You need to start saving up for your own future too. Your parents should start relying on their CPF."
"I'm just saying this, as somebody in charge of family finances, trying to get my fresh grad brother to take up some responsibilities like right now.Do homework first. In a family of 4, things will usually work out to 1k. You don't have to give them 1k, but at least figure out why they are asking for 1k.The money feels like a lot because you just getting familiar with stuffs, but if you break things down, you'll usually find very logical items to pay for, and go ""WTF why are things so expensive"".Start off by finding out the cash flow situation at home. What do your parents have to pay. Things like electricity bills, conservation bills, phone bills, insurance etc. Offer to take care of these if you can (they have less things they can say they need to pay for, you are taking away their bargaining power and showing initiative). I hope these end up around 300 bucks for you, if your family uses air-conditioning, it's gonna be much more.Work out the rest from there. I think 500 for their pocket money is a good start if you eat at home often and they are not working. Again, my line of reasoning, is to pay for what I take first. 500 is good value for me, could be different for you.Please have a talk with them, especially if you have a study loan to deal with. Just do what you feel is right.And lastly, really la, the bills will work out to about 500 dollars, if your parents see doctor it's gonna be at least 75 per trip."
Lol sounded like me. I was earning 2.5k and my mum wanted 1k a month.I told her wtf I am trying to save for marriage then she say if you can’t afford to give me 1k how are you going to get married?So yeah gritted my teeth and give her 1k a month.Jokes on her. I am making 25k now and she’s still getting 1k.
Wow what is your job that you earn 25k per month
"I work in the financial sector.Anyway nothing special, it’s almost 10 years ago that I was earning 2.5k.Whatever job/industry you’re doing, as long as you are good you should see significant pay increment over time. Of course some more than others."
"Woah, grats on getting that far!So, did your mom ever get into fits over the 1k situation?"
"She wasn't very nice about it when asking me for money.And there wasn't a good reason for her to ask me for money, she never worked for like 30 over years, and then my dad is still working and they don't really need the money for retirement etc.So i told her, ok fine, you are making demands now, I'll give in to your demand this time round but I'll not give you any higher in the future.Yeah sucks to be her. I actually do love her and can easily give her more than the 1k, I mean i'm freaking paying >2K a month for a nanny for my daughter. But hey, you want to be demanding then you don't get nice things.Really, ironically if she didn't demand (i was already freaking giving her 500 when I was earning 2.5k), I would feel better about giving her more. Now is more like ""you want to play like this, then i play lor"""
Gd for u man. You’re not a biological atm.
Lol does it matter?What is it to you.
"Then go and search yourself what jobs pay well and then see if you can get your feet in the door. Not sure how I tell you what I do is better than what these websites have to say.Also, if you were really interested, you would have checked my post history and find out yourself.Initiative is very important if you want to be successful. Not trying to be a dick but I think you can really do better."
Must be the steamed kuay png that helps cut costs
"For those who are students and working part time, so you pay a portion to your parents too?"
"It's up to you. If you're comfortable, and have more than you need, then sure, go ahead, but if you need the money, then don't feel obligated to."
"I used to make 2.8K after CPF and gave $300. Now I live overseas and don't give anything. My reasoning is that my parents are well-off and don't need it, and I need to save up for things like buying a house, getting married and so on. It's really on a case-by-case basis."
"Just to check, are your parents employed? Will you be the main/sole breadwinner? If you are, then unfortunately 1000 is probably a good estimate for family upkeep.If not, give what you can afford. 500-600 should be enough. Maybe also offer to pay for certain bills, like wifi."
"pay for certain bills, like wifi.I was thinking of this as well. Yes they are employed and are quite comfortable."
"If they're both employed then $1000 is too much. After CPF you will only have $1400. Tell them you need to save for future expenses like wedding plus house. This will be about $50,000 if you split 50-50 with your future wife/husband. Assuming it happens in 5 years time, you'll need to save $833 a month. You'll be left with $567 a month for expenditure. Definitely not enough.If they still insist, subtly tell them that they will have to pay for your wedding"

I'm sorry if this comes across as rude then but your mother is plain greedy.If they're both financially comfortable and still working there's no reason she should be asking for so much of your salary. Just pay the bills at most.
"Get a breakdown?How much are your Uni fees per year?If Uni Fees are considered a loan from your parents work out a principal + interest (if any) over a payment period.Basically, formalise it."
"I give 10% of my salary, and an extra bonus come bonus time."
"0 is a good amount. Your parents decided to give birth to you so they have a moral obligation to provide you with the necessities of life (food water uni education blah blah) regardless of cost. You, on the other hand, did not choose to be born so you have no moral obligation to give them any of your income. Whatever you do decide to give to them is out of goodwill and your mother shouldnt complain no matter what the amount."
If you are living with them you got to at least give a bit lah. i feel its ridiculous to not give them a cent when you are working full time and eating and staying at their house.
"I earn $1600. I know its not a lot compared to the rest of the other redditors. I give $200 every month or more whenever I can give.i understand the sentiment, but it would be wiser for OP to save and invest the money early and regularly. After all, he/she is going to shoulder the burden of taking care of his/her parents after their retirement. If the money is going to be spent, then it is all wasted potential. Unless the money goes into paying off loans, 0 is the best amount. The 1k, at a 33% or more savings rate or more, could mean that OP could be financially free by 50 or earlier.There are always non-monetary ways to help out in the household anyway"
Hear hear!
WORD!
wah bro you damn savage lol.
3.5 is before CPF? your take home is only 2.8 after you give 1k I am not sure what's left for you to save.
yes before cpf. exactly my thoughts as well. I really want to save up.
I went for 1/3 of take home pay (after CPF deduction) when I first started work. Recent years becoming closer to 1/4 of take home pay.
I give 1/3 of my pay. Initially when I started work it was really hard cause I need to pay back my school fees and savings and all that. Now my pay slowly increase it’s not 1/4 yet but it’s not that painful anymore. I justify it as paying for my keep lo. Live under their roof ma. But I don’t think it will increase anytime soon.
"I started out at 2.4k, gave my mom 500 every month. That's around 20%. Maybe you can give your mom 700 at 20%."
"It is simple. Calculate your expenses for a month (in approximate terms) like groceries, utilities, phone, rent (if any), food (if you eat outside more often than not), travel, insurance, other investments etc. Keep 50% to 80% of the remaining as savings depending on how much you end up with after your expenses. The lower the amount remaining, the more you save. Whatever is left can be treated as overhead."
"I second this. I don’t give my parents that much but that’s because their living expenses are low and I don’t stay with them.You should be able to cover your rent, food, utilities + allowance to your parents. So roughly 500 + 200 + 50 + 300 = $1050.If your mom cooks, washes and cleans for you, you’re also getting a lot of bonus value."
"Just give the amount you're willing to give. At the end of the day, its the thought that counts. Parents that are reasonable won't really fuss over the amount. If you're still living with them take into account of the total amount bills like electricity bills and adjust the amount accordingly."
"If you're counting gross pay, 1k is quite high IMO. I do have good friends whose parents demand 1k per month even when they were starting out with 2.5k gross, and it made it difficult for them to save up for further education / housing they may wish to get.You probably will also want to save for the future + start contributing to insurance + save for income tax, and it all adds up.I had a discussion with my parents to manage expectations, and told them the breakdown is something like this: 20% - CPF contribution 30% - Spending, including expenditure on basic adulting necessities e.g. taxes and insurance 40% - Saving and investing 10% - Allowance for themI felt it was flexible enough to be scaled up as my pay increased, and fully recommend the % system."
"Idk..OP, the fact that you mom asked for a specific amount of money is kinda telling."
"Word of advice. Monthly contribution can only increase. It can never decrease, unless you are out of job. The moment it decreases, your parents will kick up a ruckus, seeing how they are already demanding for 1k for your starting job."
Yes good point. Better start out lower then lol. So that the increments will be manageable.
"I believe it is the parents’ obligation to provide and care for their child through adulthood. It was their choice to bring them into the world. So maybe through 22-23 is a good cutoff age where the child is considered an adult and expected to begin the transition.A young adult in their 20s should be increasingly self sufficient. This encompasses, among other things, experiencing the cost of real goods and labour like rent, utilities, laundry/cleaning services.If I were a parent I would begin the transition by expecting my adult child to begin contributing their share of expenses if they wish to continue living at home. Yr 1 of adulthood - 50% of costs. Yr 2 - 75% of costs. Yr 3/4/5 - 100% of costs. Yr 6 onwards >100% of costs increasingly till child leaves. Once they are no longer living with me they don’t need to pay a dime. I would want my adult child to be launched into adult society as a mature, independent person and I believe this can only be achieved if they lived outside of the family home.I also will never expect my adult child to contribute to my retirement. Saving for all my needs is my responsibility.Sad thing is my parents are pretty much the toxic parents who had kids as their investment and are now expecting to collect on their big score. So everything I wrote here is my fantasy of how I would treat my own kids when said kids will never materialize because the pressure from above is crushing my spirit and ability to provide adequately for a hypothetical child."
"If your mum is struggling financially and really needs that 1K for bills/household expenses etc then do help her out.If she's just asking for 1K for the heck of it, no.1/3.5 K is not a small sum to ask for."
I am also earning around your range. I'm giving my mum $600 which I find it reasonable as she cooks dinner and help wash my clothes.
Imagine if you were to rent a room + buying your own food + paying utilities etc. You can decide how much you should contribute to household expenses as an earning adult.
"This. I never saw it as giving parents but for paying for board. I mean, housing you, free food, laundry all cost money.When you are young and unable to earn, it is their responsibility to provide. But now, you can pay for your own keep, it is only right to cover the cost."
1k is too much. Can’t you tell your mum you wanna save for the future. Are both your parents working?
Yes they are.
"Which line would you be going into op? Seems like you are 94 batch? 😀 on topic, i think $500 out of 3k is already very tight, or you can set it at 10% of your salary which thus scales as your pay rises.Nonetheless like others mentioned, it seems you need to separate the loan repayment from the ""filial allowance"" to get a clearer picture"
Yes I think thats a good way to start the discussion with her. I will be going into engineering.
You should ask yourself. How much is sufficient for yourself? Contribute the rest to them. One day it is going to come back to you anyway.
"That's making a lot of assumptions on the character of OP's parents. Some parents do want the best for their children. Some just don't. My husband's mom managed to gamble away all of their savings to the point that my father-in-law is so deeply in debt that they've had to sell their flat and he's moving out of the country to go live with relatives overseas. This would have been terrible advice for my husband, because that money would have just gone to MBS."
"take home 3.5k or gross? you can try that for a few months, and track your normal monthly spending to see if it is sustainable. Further discussion can be done after that. Both my parents were working when i started working so I gave a token 10-15% , and I was repaying the study loan to CPF."
Depends. I give 1k but I’m living with them and am single and no other commitments.
"20%, more if you aren't paying your phone bills and utilities, and a bit more to cover groceries and 'rent' if you're staying with your parents."
:/ I feel awful. I never give my parents only buy the groceries and sometimes I give my dad cash.
10% for me but I used to help out with the utility bills every now and then when I was still living with them.
Just give lo. You will feel more motivated to earn more anyway
"15 years ago I started at $2700 a month, and gave my mum $700.Now, I've also taken over all recurring household expenses with the retirement of my dad, so my total contributions run in around $2 -2.5kIn the end you need to evaluate the needs of your parents. If they need that $1k to get by, I wouldn't begrudge them the money. If you're still living with them, think of it as paying rent now that you can stand on your own two feet."
"My parent know I don't earn alot so they ask me to contribute 150.Recently up to 200. If they want me to up, they will inform me de and I will try and up as much as i can"
20% of your gross should be enough unless your mother is housewife then have to give more
Forever 1k even when my salary lower then u
"TS, you mentioned that your parents are quite comfortable. IMO, if money is not urgent and your parents are supportive, they will not be asking for money when you have the goal of saving up for post-grad studies. What are they going to do with the money, assuming they can well afford normal expenses, is for you to figure out."
Market Rate is 10% of monthly income from what I’ve seen
"OP, I am earning exactly the same as you now - $3500. The first thing you need to do is to deduct your CPF contribution so you get the remaining which is your take-home pay. That will be $2800.Out of this $2800:$450 for my parents ($300 for my mum, $150 for my dad)$500 for repaying my uni loan$450 for insurance, endowment plan and long-term savings plan$80 for town council S&CC fee$70 for transport$50 for phone billSo I am left with $1200. I try to save at least $700 and the remaining $500 goes to my miscellaneous spending such as food, shopping etc.I find that giving 10-15% of your take-home pay to your parents is good enough.My advice to you is that you should sit down and work out your budget, just like what I did above. Most importantly, you have to be comfortable with the budget that you have allocated accordingly."
"Worth considering: If roles are reversed, would you ask your kids for 1K? As someone who does not have kids yet, perhaps we can't say for certain. But I sure as hell hope I won't become a parent who asks for 1.5/3 K of my kids salary. So there."
From take home -20% save20% invest30% needs10% wants20% parents (10% each)Fucking hell where got money to give 1kYes I want you to be able to live somewhat comfortably but I AM NOT YOUR FUCKING FINANCIAL INVESTMENT
"First, congrats!Secondly, that is a lot. What in the world? That's more than 1/3 of your pay after CPF! I contributed about 10% of my pay back then."
"Have an open conversation with your parents as an adult. I.e. Talk to them like you would talk to your other adult friends.Ask them why they need the money, and wehther it's just meant to be a gesture of filial piety or if they need financial assistance. I think most parents just expect this because it's the way they did it too, and not because they have considered the issue themselves. So warning - this will be an awkward conversation thst could be painful.I spoke with my parents when I started working (5k), and they insisted that they should get 20-30%. I asked why. They said its a gesture of piety.I said if it's a gesture why is there an fixed proportion. They then tried to change tracks by saying that they will return the money ""some day"" with interest.I pointed out that they are generally horrible at investing. They agreed, and then they just appealed to some vague concept of how I should contribute.We dropped the topic for a few weeks and then I eventually set up a Giro for 1000 each month. I now earn more than 5k but haven't been asked to increase the contribution amount"
"Personally I do 20% rounded to the nearest hundred.I suggest you work backwards. See how much you think you want to save, as a %, what your usual spend is. Then see what you have left over. Adjust until comfortable.Explain to your parents you are only willing to give a %. And stick to the % even your when pay goes up.That's what I do at least"
"I think you should factor of your parents' means, how expensive you were as a child and how much you earn. My parents had the means but didn't give me much so i only paid for the groceries."
Depending on family but minimum guideline is 300 to avoid maintenance of parents act. Literally financial suicide to give parents more especially if they are the poor money manager sort so common among the older generation.The same 1k invested in your early twenties is worth a hell lot more than 1k face money to pre retirees.
Could I trouble you to elaborate on the maintenance of parents act part?
"Simply put, sg has a law that mandates children provide for their aged parents even if the parents were scum and gambling abusers. You can check out the full details online. But this requires the parents to trigger it. So the same sort of dead beat parents are the exact sort of people who will kick up a huge fuss to get money.That said the act in itself isn’t bad cos it’s an avenue for those parents who got abandoned by their heartless children."
"It sounds about right. If you stop living with your parents, your parents could easily rent out your room for minimum $700. $1k if the location is good. Even more if it's a condo. Then add in the cost of feeding you, utlities, cleaning up after you etc.You are already a working adult. Your parents no longer has any obligation to give you more handouts, and are entitled to recover the costs of allowing you to live in their house, especially since you are able to afford it."
"I think it boils down to what you aim for in the future. If you’re looking to get married/buy a house/get a car in the near future, your parents should know and adjust it accordingly.I’ve set to give my parents around $600 a month once I graduate in a year, I’m looking to get married and get a house in the near future too so I’m sure they’ll understand, but of course, it all depends on your parents, whether they’re working and all.I always try to remember tho, that when I had nothing and could barely walk/talk, they set aside much more than $600 a month and were never stingy with my upbringing, I believe you reap what you sow and my parents were great, so even if they ask for more (for the right reasons of course) I’d be willing to fork it out."
I share the same sentiments. My parents gave me their very best and gave me whatever they could.In my opinion i think their sacrifices are priceless and no amount of money would be sufficient to repay their time and effort in bringing us up.That said I am currently taking home 2.6 (fresh grad) and giving back 800. I also offer to pay for their groceries when I can. My aim now is to be successful and give them a good life they deserve.

"What is more concerning for me is that 1.4 Million is eligible for GST vouchers. It's not my label but G's own label that the 1.4 Million people have low income, their words.Mind you this is 1.4 million citizens in a country with 3.47 million citizens as of 2018. Out of the 3.47 million we have around 800-900K below 21 years old, which makes around 2.6-2.7 million adults. It is likely that the elderly above 65 years old of around 500-600K is included in the 1.4 million citizens eligible for the GST vouchers, so it'll be 800K - 900K number of adults of working age out of 2.1 million that is earning less than 28K a year.This is scary. We effectively have only 1.3 - 1.4 million, or less than 1/3 of the citizenry that is not earning ""low income"". Do remember this is individual income. When put stats like this makes you wonder if we can actually sustain ourselves in the future."
"What's the threshold for qualifying as ""low income""?"
"You have to ask G. They refuse to define ""poverty line""."
Interesting observation. Makes me think how we became the world's most expensive city despite not having a lot of income and spending power to begin with.
World's most expensive city for expat. If you factor in hdb and remove coe we are not at the top.
Makes me think how we became the world's most expensive city despite not having a lot of income and spending power to begin with.It really is just foreign investments pumping things up.
"While it is disconcerting, I think it's the government's way of being more progressive with what is normally a regressive tax. I'm actually quite impressed with this implementation, because it avoids annoying busywork (like defining what a Jaffa Cake is), is cheaper to implement, and (theoretically) allows the government to fine-tune the amount of GST a typical household should pay before it becomes a burden.While more can be done (the tiers are relatively narrow and may not help that lowest income households that much), it's still a good thing to have, and I consider it one of the better policies."
"I'm not really concerned about the money given etc.I'm just shocked at the sheer % of population that is considered low income by G's own standard. I mean the numbers have always been available just that I never really noticed. We just think the poor as say bottom 20%, but then you realize the number of people earning less than 28K is staggering."
"It certainly is; I didn't mean to downplay your concerns. It's a number of bad factors (culture, the way our economy is structured, our policies, population spread — lots of old, fewer young) but I think HSK is trying to do something about it, which is why the budget is an expansionary one, in the hopes of increasing the economy and spreading the wealth around. In theory anyway."
"cultureNot sure how culture is at work here.the way our economy is structured, our policies, population spreadYeah definitely this.lots of old, fewer youngThe numbers don't support this assertion. We are an aging population, not aged. In any case, even in the case of aging population, you would expect more % of higher earners.In theory anyway.Yeah I don't think it's enough tbh."
I am doubtful that the tightening of the quotas for foreign workers will stick. Seems like a populist move to me.
"Budgets come in various forms. Some are ""Big Bang"", full of startling surprises, good and bad. Some are status-quoist, hardly distinguishable from what came in previous years. Others are cumulative, building on the past towards a long-term goal, taking many small steps forward and a few big ones.Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat's latest Budget is in the latter category. In what is expected to be a year of slower economic growth, it is appropriately expansionary, with expenditure projected to rise to $80.3 billion, 1.6 per cent higher than in FY2018, which was also an expansionary Budget year.Budget 2019 adds to past initiatives to build enterprise capabilities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - a long-haul exercise. It sets aside $100 million for the SME co-investment fund, which will catalyse funding for SMEs and help them scale up and expand overseas. It will (from October) consolidate eight existing SME financing schemes into a single one, which will save companies the trouble of having to navigate a financial maze.To nurture the enterprises of the future, it will expand support for SMEs less than five years old by taking 70 per cent of the risk for bank loans to these companies, compared with 50 per cent at present. It will also expand programmes to help SMEs go digital and automate.While companies will welcome all of the above, many will be disappointed to learn that the quotas for foreign workers in the service sector will be tightened gradually over the next two years.While the effects will be partly offset by transitional funding support for training and development, service-intensive industries such as retail, food and beverage, healthcare and IT could face rising costs over the medium term, and find it harder to expand.GENEROUS SOCIAL POLICIESBudget 2019 provides generously for social policies, in keeping with what Mr Heng describes as ""our long-term plan to build a caring and inclusive society"".One significant initiative is to increase assistance under the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme, which provides cash payouts and Central Provident Fund top-ups to some 440,000 workers whose earnings are in the bottom 20 per cent. The qualifying income cap will be raised from $2,000 to $2,300 and the maximum payouts will be increased by up to $400, with older workers getting higher payouts.Budget 2019 provides a raft of benefits for healthcare, including enhanced subsidies under the Community Health Assist Scheme, which enables lower and middle-income Singaporeans to access primary medical and dental care at clinics near their homes; and more financial support for long-term care.But the highlight of Budget 2019 is the $6.1 billion for the Merdeka Generation Package, essentially a healthcare subsidy scheme for citizens born during the 1950s, and who obtained citizenship by 1996.Mr Heng described this group as ""an independent and resilient generation"" who played a critical role in Singapore's development, was among the earliest batches to do national service, build the public services, modernise the economy and help forge a harmonious multicultural, multiracial society.DESERVING BUT DIVERSEThese achievements deserve acknowledgement and gratitude. But, compared with the Pioneer Generation, the Merdeka Generation is better educated, enjoyed more of the best years of Singapore's economic growth as well as increases in asset values, earned more and saved more. So, it is fitting that it gets a less generous package of benefits than the Pioneer Generation received in Budget 2014.The Merdeka Generation is also diverse, including business tycoons, well-heeled professionals, middle-class people, as well as blue-collar and low-income workers, some of whom have retired. So, to the question of whether all of them are equally deserving, at least in terms of need, the answer is ""no"".Normally, when distributing benefits, the Government follows strict eligibility criteria based on need, as in, for example, the GST Voucher Scheme, the WIS or Silver Support Scheme, all of which are subject to rigorous means testing, and rightly so. But surprisingly, in the case of the Merdeka Generation Package, the benefits are to be distributed regardless of need, with the well-heeled getting the same as low-income retirees. Moreover, most of the benefits are not one-off, but for life.While still rewarding all of the Merdeka Generation, the package could be made more progressive by giving bigger benefits to its lower and middle-income members than to those more affluent.Health subsidies now cover just about all of Singapore's elder population. While this is a solid achievement that should do any government proud, it also entails the risk of overconsumption of healthcare services, signs of which are already evident. With subsidy bills likely to escalate over the coming years, it might in future be prudent to shift some of the burden to the private sector - for example, by giving incentives to companies to provide more generous health benefits to employees.Another surprise in Budget 2019 is that while it astutely flags the key medium-term challenge of climate change, it contains no measures to address Singapore's demographic challenge, which is at least as urgent. At current birth rates, the citizen workforce is projected to start declining from next year.In the absence of immigration, and barring a sudden increase in fertility rates (which seems improbable), Singapore would be at risk of moving into an era of chronically low economic growth - unless productivity keeps rising and remains high, which is also improbable.Thus, while Budget 2019 does an admirable job of building enterprise capabilities and strengthening the pillars of Singapore's now-quite-impressive social security system, there remains much unfinished business to be addressed in future Budgets."
"Article spent 90% rehashing the current budget, with 10% talking about how the budget failed to address demographics. Isn't that the key and the headline."
Premium articles: an almost free article with little reinvention.
ST's job is to rehash everything that G has said. They don't dare to put in their own commentary. PAP is known to scold politics commentators as naive in the past.
Thanks!!
Thanks mate.
Much impressed. Is this Original Content?
"Yup, from my place."
spoilers
"Wow, I never noticed. Those two characters also showed up for less than 5 mins in season 2. How does it have the same rating as The Umbrella Academy?! Such censorship is honestly pathetic, especially when you realize it's based on the ridiculous notion that one's sexuality can be affected by shows."
"I've also seen the IMDA censorship quite a few times for US game shows on Channel 5: if you noticed that a contestant wasn't introduced like the others and it felt like an abrupt time skip, chances are that contestant was openly gay and they couldn't possibly broadcast that 🙄"
https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/singapore-cuts-obamas-lgbt-comments-on-ellen-0Obama's speech was also censored lol.
I only realised I had watched a cut version of V for Vendetta when I read the Wikipedia synopsis and realised I missed an entire subplot. I hope the irony of cutting out a lesbian character being tortured and killed by a totalitarian government isn’t lost on the assholes at IMDA who cut the film.
Did they also cut out Stephen Fry's character?
Thank goodness no. I don't think he was playing a gay character in the film though.
"Was he not? Dietrich certainly came across as rather camp, and I could've sworn there were at least some allusions to him being gay if not explicitly mentioned."
They also cut out some pages of a Japanese magazine from Kinokuniya.
Damn it... Are they going start disappearing people because they splash some ink on a picture too?
"TBH, when I was binge watching yesterday and saw the M18 rating, I was half expecting the show to go really dark.I thought probably an on screen death, war between the elves and humans gonna escalate or maybe even an explicit Rayllum action.I was slightly disappointed."
Makes sense for a conservative country.Best not to rustle up the jimmies of Christians and Muslims when they make up a sizable portion of the electorate.Pragmatic government is pragmatic.
"Marie Kondo was rated M18 anyways, so it’s normal."
Oh yea... a show about tidying up a house has an M18 rating
I believe it’s because she helps a gay couple to clean up at one point. Falls under normalizing homosexuality.
Cos u move or get kicked out of your parents house after you're 18 so dont need till then
"Yeah.. I was like WTF, is she gonna go in and clean up after the red wedding or something?"

Serious? OMG 😱
cos a gay man kissed another gay man romantically. (one of the episodes)
Love simon the movie is R21 fyi
I really had to laugh!
"Modern Family (the comedy sitcom) is R21 on Netflix. Why? Because it shows a gay couple living normal lives (except for sitcom hijinks). IMDA's stance is that normalizing homosexuality requires a high rating.However, that doesn't mean that you can't watch it at home with teens. It just means that Netflix will require you to type in the PIN (that the subscriber sets) each time you watch one session.I'm not sure about M18. Maybe it means that it won't show up if you log in with the Kids profile."
Omg you know I was actually wondering how come it was R21 when I was watching modern family. Couldn’t figure out why it had that rating even though it didn’t even have sex/gore etc. If you didn’t mention cam and Mitch’s relationship I would never have noticed lol.
"Meanwhile polar has full blown sex scene and it’s rated m18, and it doesn’t require a PIN.It weird that showing a gay couple is rated R21 but topless women and sex is rated M18"
What is this pin you guys keep talking about... I don’t see it or have I not watch r21 show yet
"It’s like a parental control, when watching R21 shows on Netflix, it would prompt the user to input a 4 digit code to watch the show."
"FYI, Netflix’s PIN implementation is the laziest possible password implementation I’ve ever seen. It is obviously there to check IMDA’s boxes, and not as any sort of real parental control. Mine is set to 0000, and Netflix happily accepted it."
"I mean, why not.Gahmen gets to cite regulations to appease conservative voters while Netflix gets to operate in Singapore, business as usual."

Hardstuck? What mean?
"Ah so that's why Modern Family needed my pin but ""You"" did not."

"This is such a great series by great writers. Anyone that loved Avatar: The Last Airbender should absolutely check it out.Actually, everyone should. It is really well done. As a father of 3, I absolutely would have no problem with any of my kids seeing this content after age 8."
this is peak Singapore
Queer Eye is R21 as well
"It's the same with Riverdale. Titans is M18 because language and gore, but Riverdale is M18 because of some LGBTism sadly"
"It's such a pity because it is an amazing show (throwback to Last Airbender) has many touching moments, and deals with a few serious issues in a thoughtful way. Exactly what I would like my kids to watch (if I had any)."
I'm mixed on this. I somehow don't blame IMDA as its definitely much easier for their staff and policies to simply m18 the article. Rather than taking complaints from the public and the staff.The citizen's mentality need to change before the policies can
"The government and its policies have a huge influence on how citizens view issues, especially in a one part state like Singapore.Saying that the government has to wait for the citizens mentality to change is glossing over the fact taht the government has never really been troubled to overrule citizen mentality when it suits them."
"Playing Devil's advocate here - while I agree with your assertion, I feel like that there's slightly more to the issue since one of the driving forces between these sentiments are religious organisations. The Government so far seems to be especially cautious about offending the NCCS, which isn't a surprise considering their immense lobbying power from having friends in high places.Obviously, it would be ideal if the Government would have the balls to enforce separation of church and State when dealing with these groups. However, with all their fuck ups elsewhere, I can see why they're afraid of losing further votes from the conservative/religious demographic. Just my 2 cents."
"You raise a decent point, but I would refer you to my counter point which has now also become an iconic part of the Singapore skyline: MBS.When the casinos were being discussed the religious groups all complained, but the govt went ahead with it anyway.I don't think the govt is particularly scared of the religious groups, it's more that LGBT people aren't worth the trouble, for now."
"Yup, no argument with you there. Pragmatically, there is very little benefit to the Government (compared to the casino issue which had significant economic benefits).With regards to your point, the key difference is that that the political climate in 2006/2007 was markedly different from today. Back then, the Government was in a position of strength politically, which made it easier to wayang the public consultation before proceeding as planned all along. My guess is that the current Government is a lot more insecure about losing votes as we actually have a credible opposition now. Losing the conservative vote by supporting LGBT issues would probably outweigh whatever votes they'd manage to win from that."
"What would conservatives vote for though... the WP?I get that conceptually it's possible for Lawrence Khong to start asking his church goers to all send in spoiled ballots, but that seems a bit unlikely."
"Or they would just abstain from voting while they originally intended to vote PAP. It's still a lost vote. I think the arithmetic in their heads is that all it takes is 1 fundamental disagreement for someone to decide not to vote for them. Whether or not thats true in practice is debatable, but hey, that's insecurity for you."
"I agree. But subtly restricting films such as these are not going to spread homophobia to a large extend. Most people wouldn't even know about it. Like others have said, the benefits are so little compared to the chaos that religious or Conservative groups will bright out"
"The citizen's mentality need to change before the policies canThat isn't necessarily true. As an example of an equally controversial topic, in the earlier days, the government moved on the abortion issue and dealt with possible repercussions in various ways.As I mentioned earlier in LGBT discussions here, since then, the later (and current) generations of PAP leaders have shown less appetite to tackle genuinely socially controversial topics or to take up progressive stances.Just look at how long it took for more support for single mothers to materialize in benefits for them.Rather than say Singapore is socially conservative, it is more accurate to say the social conservatives are in power."
You should open your eyes. The shit flows downstream in this country and decisions have always been top down.
"I like to be optimistic (albeit, overly) and think that the govt knows about it too and just sets it up as a formality, since kids nowadays know how to go over it."
Is this show worst than bojack horseman? Shouldnt get a higher rating than bojack.
It's directly comparable to The Last Airbender which has a PG rating.
Not much violence but got on screen magical death ala 1990's sub-zero fatality
Dragon Prince is actually 7+ in most countries.
"Most western countries* , probably banned in alot of countries"
Atypical in Singapore was R21 FOR NO REASON other than in ONE SCENE IN THE ENTIRE SHOW where she does weed(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻ ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
im not straight so i wonder if i will get fucking arrested for kissing another woman
How much do the ratings matter? They can't police what kids watch in their own homes right? It's up to the parents.
More like covering the legal aspect from their end. Just like porn sites that asks if you are over 18

"Man threatened to ‘blow things up’ if ex-girlfriend did not have sex with himSINGAPORE — When she realised that her boyfriend was filming them having sex, she told him to stop but he refused to.About a month later, jealous that she went for meals with her male colleagues, he threatened to send them the videos.She filed a police report after he told her he would “blow things up” if she did not meet him to have sex.On Monday (Feb 18), the 36-year-old man was sentenced to eight weeks’ jail after pleading guilty to criminal intimidation and making an obscene film.The man cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the victim’s identity.The man was married to someone else when he and the victim were in a relationship.They dated for five years before the 24-year-old victim broke up with him on or around June 27 last year. It was not disclosed in court if the man is still married.About a week before the break-up, the man took a nine-minute video of them engaging in various sexual acts at his residence.She was not aware when he began filming but one-and-a-half minutes into the video, she noticed his mobile phone recording them from a nearby stool.“She said, ‘Why you recording me?’ and ‘Don’t. No…’ to express that she wanted him to stop recording. However, he did not do so,” Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Eugene Teh told the court.On July 17 last year, the victim was having dinner with a male colleague at The Centrepoint mall when she noticed a missed call from him. They had broken up by then.He went over to the mall to meet her and they went for drinks at Cuppage Terrace nearby as he was “not in a good mood”.They ordered and drank a tower of beer. He then told her he was “angry and jealous” that she kept using her mobile phone while out with him, but did not check or reply to his messages when she was out with her male colleagues.He threatened to send her colleagues a video of them having sex, having filmed multiple videos without her consent using his mobile phone.When he played her one of the videos, she felt scared, pressured and disturbed.He then sent her home, asking her to have sex with him. She was unwilling but agreed to have sex with him the following day so she could go home.He called the next day, asking to have dinner and sex. She expressed reluctance and he got upset and threatened to “blow things up” if she did not turn up.Fearing he would leak the explicit videos, she filed a police report that evening.There was no evidence that the man sent the videos to the victim’s colleagues, but DPP Teh argued that he was “fully capable of materialising and fulfilling the threats”.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

"Technically speaking, the password can go up to 15 digits and there's an alarm after 4 tries. So you can guess it right away if you are super lucky."
is this even allowed
so ill glue a non conductive film layer on top and wreck it?
Could this be vandalism?

Someone can help me share to the main sg reddit? Because I have low karma and cant post it there.
"Sure. Can provide raw photo, or do you want me to crosspost?"
"Someone already shared yesterday, thx."
Aww....I wanted to be a karmawhore...
"It would suck to have to shoot and aim out of your weaker eye/side, lol. I am left handed and left eye dominant but thankfully I was in SCDF, haha."
Force to go right
Shooting Always Right = SAR geddit?
Yes Encik!
Ah I still remember how they told us the SAR21 was suitable for both left and right-handed personnelYes because I'd love to have cartridges burn my face and hands
"Pretty sure there's an internal deflector. When you look at where the shell casings end up shooting the SAR-21 vs M-16 it's pretty obvious.SAR-21 was built to be ambidextrous, it's obvious when you consider the in-built deflector and the invertable charging handle.It's because of a chamber explosion incident, they put a kevlar plate inside the rifle to protect against chamber explosions, directing a chamber explosion away from the face of a right handed firer, but directly into a left-handed firer's face. SAF safety regulations therefore don't allow you to fire it left-handed, but it should be good with the exception of a rare-chamber explosion."
"As a lefty, suck thumb lor. Same goes for literally everything related to ns."
"Based on my experience in BMT, the sgt will go around asking everyone and taking note. They may even bring a gun around for you to test try. Those LHLE ones will have to get used to it, but since they took note, they will pay more attention to you to make sure you can handle it properly. Personally I am right-handed in writing but everything else left-handed. Forgot which eye dom."
As a le but right hand it was annoying
"Same here. I bought an eyepatch. I got shat on a bit but I stopped it with ""you either let me wear this, or wait for me to pass on my reshoot."""
"I am exactly that profile. BMT shooting isn't an issue; the shoot is only 100m, so good technique is enough to score for marksman. Doing the same for the 300m shoots in unit is tough tho."
SAR isnt exactly for left handers
they will just take note but if I remember correctly you will still go right.
Cartridge comes out from the right so you always have to shoot it right handed.
"Just remember to wear your eye patch when going for mob, you need to wear an eye patch to fight war.What will happen when you get into an actual gunfight with a correct handed enemy?"
Just squint your other eye lor
Just see better lol 4Head
"My left eye is slightly below-perfect and my right eye is almost 1k degree.Have to shoot right-eyed. With specs of course.But I know how eyes work, so I just narrow/squint my good eye to see from my bad eye.Not sure wtf are eye-patches for?"
"Just as a person can be left or right handed, they can also have a dominant eye. If asked to use one eye, people tend to use their dominant one, so for aiming down the SAR21 scope, left eye dominant people will tend to try and use their left eye instead of their right. While you can train your brain to use the right eye, it is a lot simpler to just force yourself to use the right eye with an eyepatch on the left eye."
But can just close one eye mahI guess maybe wartime drag few hours the eyelid will tired
"Uh, like I said, dominant left eye ppl will tend to want to use their left eye, so they will close right eye and try to use left eye to aim, then they realise they can't.For range shooting, this is an issue as you have limited time that the target is up"
Are you left eye dominant?
"Yes, but I was in an air weapons club in JC so I can switch to right eye easily now (I have dominant left eye, and am right handed so I couldn't just use a left handed weapon). But yeah initially I wanted to use left eye to aim."
"Right side, cos the shell casing shoots out the right side. it rly doesnt suck to shoot out your non dominant eye/hand unless your hand eye coordination has already been trained as such. Changing eye dominance just takes a few weeks of practice and the handedness is the same."
"Left eye and hand here. No choice use right. I tried using eye patch in BMT but it didn't work too well for me. Now I aim with both eyes open and have to focus on the scope.Fuck the SAR, so many years still haven't update knn."
"After a while you'll get used to it.When playing soccer, I'm right leg but I purposely force myself to play left leg as well. Feels very weird but opened up more options.Now I'm using a skateboard, again right leg, so my right leg is in front. But I force myself to put my left leg in front on the broad. Feels very weird initially, now it feels less weird.Only think I have tried is to use left hand to write. 😂"
"You'll get hurt if you aim with your left eye.To give you an example why, this is how you'll be trained to fire the weapon.Notice that the ejection port is directly where your face will be if fired from a southpaw configuration.The reason for this is due to the bullpup design of the SAR21, a design shared with the Steyr AUG."
"Am left master eye. When I went for range at Mmrc the guy gave me this small black board attached to a clothes peg. You clip it on the scope to act as an “eye patch” to block out your left eye so you don’t need to keep closing your left eye but can still focus. It worked miracles I tell you!better than an eye patch that you need to get used to, and your left eye is blocked only when you’re using the scope."
"sars were designed for chamber explosions to go off towards the right side so that pretty much a no go, along with all the single hand fire controls, its a mess"
Only holding guns is with my left hand. Playing football with left also but the rest is with right hand. Got lucky in doing marksman shoot so I was able to pass. Got chewed out one time by sectionmates and instructor for holding my rifle in my left and was doing vehicle drill
"Nope, be a normie and go right"
I'm right handed but left eye dominant. Had to shoot with my left hand (During M16 days) and was an absolute retard at the range.
"Alot of ""Side Shows""?"
I was hit in the face by a spent cartridge before.Was doing range safety and squatting behind one of the shooters during the standing position.Gave me a slight burn zz.
"They wont care one. For SAR21, diedie must shoot like righthanders. They might have eyepatch and that’s about it."
Force to go right.There is a left handed way of shooting but it is really awkward which is why they just force you to go right
"I’m right handed and left eye dominant. Didn’t dare to or know if can sound off, so just used right eye. Still turned out ok, got marksman."
SAR 21 is a RIGHT HANDLED GUN. You cannot use left hand to shoot.
i’m left handed.didn’t matter much though. i just followed and did the same thing as the rest. no difficulty getting marksman too.
"who am I? I am a teen (M17) who just completed my O's.why a throwaway? I'll be completely honest, I just don't want to be identified at all. I rarely ask for help like this irl and feel very embarrassed, may not be right but that's me.Alright so with that out of the way, I wanna set the context, my parents are running a business that is not going well. They are currently indebt of 10k+. All my life, they've been dysfunctional and really can't fix solutions together, or really have a mature conversation-- period. Also they aren't young. At all.Another thing is I'm getting my teeth fixed currently but it costs money that my parents don't have.So what I need advice for is:how can I generate as much money as possible in 6 months before I enroll for a diploma? Only way I can think is soul-sucking warehouse jobs that I am open to but would like to hear more. I want to pay for my diploma (after the bursary, somewhere between $100-$1k annually), my own living expense ($50(?) a month currently, will increase when school starts), and my own personal items, my computer is prehistoric. ($1.3k-ish)how can my family proceed from here on out, in terms of finance and being less toxic? (ps: I have 2 other siblings that are trying to carry their own weight, which I also want to do)I will try my best to reply any enquiries.Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you."
"soul sucking jobSon, welcome to adulthood."
"take on a part time job during your studies, tons of people do that. Why must it be a warehouse job? can always work in the service industry (bubble tea ah restaurant ah always hiring).do you speak chinese? realistically speaking being able to speak chinese means easier communication in the service industry (more likely to get a job)."
"Yes I intend to work while studying. Warehouse jobs have higher rates, and have longer longer hours as well. I really am trying to capitalize on the time I have even if it means I have to 'suffer' per se. Thanks for your input :)"
"If you can, secure a tuition job. Particularly for primary tuition. If you are good at MT even better. Participate in focus groups and paid surveys, when possible. And whatever you do, do not, repeat, do NOT join an MLM"
Take a Tuition Fee Lon and Study Loan with DBS for your studies. Interest free during the course of study. Study includes up to $2K a year living allowance. Go and google for specifics.
"Thanks, hopefully bursary is still applicable along with those you mentioned."
"how can I generate as much money as possible in 6 months before I enroll for a diploma? Only way I can think is soul-sucking warehouse jobs that I am open to but would like to hear more.The best way I can think of is to get a sales job and get good at it. Basically anything that breaks the constraint of an hourly wage, which at your level probably comes with a pretty low ceiling unless you have some special skills. Also, I don't mean MLM because fuck MLM."
"banquet, adhoc jobs, if your academics are good, give tuition"
"Do I just ask my neighbours (at lower rates of course)? I don't think I can sign up as a tutor as the standards are much higher.Of course I don't see tutoring as just an income, I have a passion to teach."
"This: try joining Telegram / FB / etc. groups specifically meant for seeking ad hoc event helpers. Some typical jobs are - promoter, registration booth helper, game stall crew etc. If you have friends in the events industry, ask them for an in!"
"As long as your academics aren't terrible, you can still try for primary school tuition...maybe $20/hour. Still better paying/hour than the other options you have."
There are some programs in poly that grants allowance (singtel scholarship) for those in engineering course in Singapore poly. So try and search for programs like that in your poly :)
How about grabfood delivery?
Ain't got data so yeah that can't be an option unfortunately.
I found working weekends (Part-Time) as a waiter/Receptionist/Doorman in high class hotels/restaurants had good (relative to warehouse jobs) working conditions and pay.
What about enlisting army earlier?
"You can try doing banquet, usually pays around $8-10 per hour. When you save enough and have $300-400 you can try sneaker reselling and you can almost double the amount you had. To me that’s the easiest and fastest way to get money legally.."
how you survive with 50 a month?
"Well food is covered by family because basically all my meals are homecooked. I don't really go out cause I'm right on cash. Mostly transport.That's for now, during my school it'll be around $150? That's my guesstimate."
I also going poly this yr. 50 is not enough .my wifi/phone/electric bill already 150/per month .not to mention transport .sometimes your friends to jio you out to eat
"Thanks for informing, not to mention school expenses like books, printing etc :///"
"Mikhy Brochez appears in US court on trespassing chargesWINCHESTER, Kentucky: The US citizen accused of leaking details of 14,200 HIV-positive people from Singapore's HIV registry appeared briefly in a Kentucky courtroom on Monday (Feb 18) on trespassing charges, telling the judge he believes the Singapore Government may be interfering in the case.Mikhy Farrera Brochez, 34, arrived without an attorney at a Clark County District Court in Winchester, Kentucky, where he had been arrested in December and charged with third-degree criminal trespassing for refusing to leave his mother’s home.AdvertisementMikhy Farrera Brochez arrives at a Clark County District Court in Winchester, Kentucky on Feb 18, 2019. (Photo: Chris Kenning)Judge Charles Hardin delayed the case until Mar 4 at the arresting officer’s request, noting that Brochez had pleaded not guilty and the charges carried no possibility of jail time. The judge told Brochez he did not know anything about his allegation of interference.Outside the courtroom before the hearing, Brochez did not directly address a reporter's question on whether he leaked information from Singapore's HIV registry. But he recently told Vice News that he shared the data with government and media sources and that the information had already been exposed.AdvertisementAdvertisementBrochez repeated claims on Monday that he contracted HIV only after ""they had me gang-raped in prison"". Singapore authorities have said his allegations are ""blatantly false”.Asked about those potentially hurt by the leak, he said: “I was thrown in prison for something I didn’t do. And I was held down and gang-raped by your government. And you want to talk to me about someone’s feelings? Do you have any idea what I’m going through right now?”Brochez stood during the hearing in a plaid button-down shirt before the judge. He said his mother wanted to drop the case, and that it was causing hardship by interfering with his ability to work. Judge Hardin said his mother did not have the right to dismiss it and continued it for two weeks.Mikhy Farrera Brochez shows up for his court hearing in Winchester, Kentucky, on trespassing charges. (Photo: Chris Kenning)His mother, Ms Teresa King, was not present and could not be reached.It was at Ms King’s house near Winchester where Brochez was arrested in December after he refused to leave, three months after police responded to a similar call and he was warned to stay away.“This deputy informed the suspect about the past warning and the suspect was instructed to leave numerous times but the suspect kept wanting to ask about the property that T. King had of his and wanting to talk to the sheriff,” according to an arrest report.After the hearing, Brochez declined to answer questions. He was accompanied by the sheriff’s deputies outside, climbing into a white Mercedes SUV and driven away. Court documents listed his home address in Lexington, Kentucky.Mikhy Farrera Brochez is seated at the Clark County District Court in Winchester, Kentucky on Feb 18, 2019. (Photo: Chris Kenning)Brochez, who had worked in Singapore as a psychology lecturer, was sentenced in 2017 to 28 months in jail on drug and fraud charges, including for using a fake blood test to lie about his HIV-positive status and gain an employment pass.His partner, Singaporean doctor Ler Teck Siang, had access to the HIV registry as part of his work as the former head of the National Public Health Unit. The pair started living together in Singapore in 2008, and were married in New York City in 2014.Singapore's Health Ministry announced on Jan 28 that Brochez, who was deported last April, had leaked online information from Singapore’s HIV registry. That included names, phone numbers, addresses, test results and medical information.He is now wanted in connection with the data leak that includes 5,400 Singaporeans diagnosed with HIV from 1985 to January 2013 and 8,800 foreigners, including work and visit pass applicants and holders, diagnosed with HIV from 1985 to December 2011.Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said in Parliament recently that the Singapore police will “spare no effort” in bringing Brochez to justice and that they are ""engaging their American counterparts and are seeking their assistance in the investigations against Brochez"".The US Embassy in Singapore has previously declined comment.Investigators say Brochez also forged his degrees including a doctorate from the University of Paris to a US teaching certification. In 2010 he had told a local newspaper that his mother was a renowned professor of child and adolescent psychology in the UK.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

"SINGAPORE — The choice of date for a Japanese cultural event organised by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) students has raised some eyebrows among members of the public.This year’s edition of the Japanese Cultural Festival, held by the NTU Japanese Appreciation Club, takes place on Monday (Feb 18) — the 77th anniversary of the Sook Ching massacre.Operation Sook Ching was a Japanese military operation in 1942 aimed at identifying and killing suspected anti-Japanese elements among the Chinese community in Singapore.According to the National Library Board’s Infopedia page, the Japanese put the official Sook Ching death count at 5,000, although the actual figure is believed to be much higher.The annual festival at NTU — which aims to showcase Japanese arts and culture — is held on campus and is open to the public.Some members of the public have objected to the festival’s chosen date.“The event says a lot about our students’ lack of knowledge and appreciation about the significant events in our country’s history,” said Facebook user Angeline Lee in a post criticising the event.However, others felt that the outrage was going too far.“There are unfortunate anniversaries on every day of the year. At what point do we stop?” asked Facebook user Edward C Yong in a comment on a shared post.An NTU spokesman explained that the date of the event was picked based on the venue’s availability.“The student organisers will observe a minute of silence at the start of the event to honour those who lost their lives during Sook Ching and World War II,” said the spokesman."
"Unfortunate for them, but TBH while we do talk about Sook Ching, we don't really commemorate the anniversary."
"Yeah. I'll be honest, I obviously know about the massacre, but I didn't even know 18 Feb was the anniversary. Am I just uninformed, or is this something most people would know?"

"To be fair, the whole latter half of February is loaded with tragic event anniversaries. The Japanese carried them out rather swiftly after they successfully conquered Singapore.This week alone literally has 3 anniversaries of some big massacre. Sook Ching on Monday, Changi Beach on Wednesday and Punggol Beach on Saturday."
A bit too sensitive I feel.. it's not as if they were celebrating Imperial Japan's achievements
"I appreciate and admire Japanese culture greatly, but I also think that it's easy for us, the younger generation, to say ""let's forget the past"" when there hasn't even been a single apology from the Japanese government for their war crimes in Singapore. I don't think that is the basis for sustainable peace."
"Too many weebs here saying ""let's move on"" while lacking any sense that this is essentially the same culture where the PM still visits the war criminals and pays tribute to them and the majority of the population think Japan was actually the victims of WW2."
"Yes, instead of celebrating the fact that we are now at peace and friends with the Japanese, we should perpetuate hate of the Japanese and the memory of a 77-year-old massacre (whose date nobody except some shit-stirrers remembers)."
"Oh damn I work in a Japanese company, how sia"
"*pours red print, hang pig head."
Nobody said anything about perpetuating hate. It was just an oversight. That said the massacre did happen so some respect in memory of the event is in order.
"the massacre did happen so some respect in memory of the event is in orderDid the staff and customers at Sakae Sushi observe a minute of silence before starting making/eating their sushi today? If not, should they have done so?"
You're just conflating different issues. Apples vs oranges.
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but the issue here seems to be this:We should be outraged at any Japanese-related activities that take place on Feb 18th in Singapore and which fail to appropriately recognise the Sook Ching massacre.So for example, if today someone dines at Sakae Sushi for her only time of the year and fails to observe a minute of silence before tucking in, then random people online should be outraged at her behaviour.Similarly if she happens to watch her only Japanese movie of the year and fails to observe a minute of silence before doing so."
I will however observe a minute of silence for you if you do decide to eat at that shithole of a sushi place.
"Are you forgetting there are survivors of that war amongst us? What you are trying to say is as long as I am not affected in anyway, I don't care."
"I agree with you that they are probably being overly-sensitive about the date - but remembering a significant event in our history does not equate to perpetuating hate for the Japanese. We remember these events, not because they are pleasant ones, or to give pretext for hate, but because the people who suffered would have like their names and their tragedy to be remembered. Regardless of whether we like it or not (or whether we bother to remember), we are recipients of this legacy and the suffering endured during this period, and the fact that any of us are where we are right now, owes in part to this event. We remember out of gratitude and not out of hate."
"I think this one only apply to our parents and grandparents, they are the ones who lived through this period and for them, this is a memory that they can't forget.Alot of things that my dad tell me, he tend to fall into this mindset of compared when under Japanese rule, blah blah blah..For most of us though, it is just a date and no big deal, for them, that date is a nightmare trigger."
"Given a long enough time and shit-stirrers, there will always be a reason to not do anything. We only have 366 dates to choose from. How liddat"
Im pretty sure the Japanese would be pissed if you had a American culture festival on the anniversery of the Hiroshima bombings.
I highly doubt it. It was America that made modern day Japan after the atom bombs after all.
"It's quite sad to see how the past is used to bring up hatred and anger. We should learn from the past, but we should not let mistakes from a past generation constantly hinder the progress of a better future."
I don't see how moving the event a couple days away is going to hinder the progress of a better future.
"An NTU spokesman explained that the date of the event was picked based on the venue’s availabilityThe circumstances didn't allow rescheduling based on given informationThis is probably unintended, but there are also overly sensitive people who blow it out of proportion"
"Many dates in February have WW2 significance anyway. Battle of Pasir Panjang, Alexandra Hospital Massacre, fall of Singapore, etc. Plus the occupation lasted 3 years. So by their logic it's not like there's any good date for a Japan-related event."
history majors deserve more respect

"The fact that its **N(ANYANG)**TU that did this, adds to the absurd hilarity of this incident."

"during the 2 year+ Japanese occupation of Singapore, there is people killed on a DAILY basis.Does this mean we don't do anything Japanese related for all 365 days of the year?"
Let’s face it the bunch of students who put this together have no inkling of history and see only the fun and cute aspects of a culture that likely doesn’t give two hoots about them and would discriminate against them as foreigners in that country.

"Of all things, why alcohol though."
need to fund merdeka package/s
Why always only 1 litre of spirits ah
They scared people get 3 liter of spirits drinks to sell in their own F&B. One shot glass about 30ml. That’s alot of lost in GST.
No fun allowed. Only productivity!
Is this a bad April Fool's Day joke?
Dont you guys have alcohol?
No one will understand unless they blizzcon
Booooooooo
I probably stick to 1 bottle of spirits and 1 bottle of wine. The taxes on the spirits are especially high
"Budget 2019: Returning home from holiday? You may have to pay more GST, buy less duty-free liquorSINGAPORE — Those travelling abroad may have to pay more Goods and Services Tax (GST) for their purchases overseas on their return, and they will enjoy duty-free concession on a lower amount of liquor products, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced in his Budget speech on Monday (Feb 18).He added that the Government is reviewing its tax system to ensure that it remains “resilient” amidst “rising international travel”.From Tuesday, travellers who spend less than 48 hours outside Singapore will get a GST relief on the first S$100 worth of goods purchased overseas, instead of the previous S$150.Those who spend 48 hours or more outside Singapore will get a GST relief on S$500 worth of goods, instead of the previous S$600.For example, from Feb 19, if a traveller has been away from Singapore for a week and purchased S$500 worth of goods, he would not need to pay GST, thanks to the tax relief of up to S$500 in purchases. However, if he buys S$800 worth of goods on that week-long trip, he would have to pay GST on the excess S$300.The relief is applicable to Singaporeans, Singapore permanent residents and tourists, but not applicable for crew members and holders of a work permit, employment pass, student’s pass, dependant pass or long-term pass.There have been cases of GST evasion in previous years.In January 2018, a 25-year-old Singaporean woman was arrested at Changi Airport for failing to declare $11,000 worth of luxury goods she had purchased overseas which were liable for GST.Mr Heng also announced that from April 1, travellers will be allowed to buy only two litres of duty-free liquor products, down from the current three litres.Currently, travellers have three litres of duty-free allowance that can be used to buy either spirits, wine or beer.The maximum duty-free allowance for spirits remains at one litre.The last time the Government tweaked the duty-free allowance was in 2010, where it allowed travellers to purchase an additional litre of duty-free wine or beer in lieu of one litre of duty-free spirits.CHANGES ON DUTY-FREE CONCESSION:Currently, travellers have three litres of duty-free allowance that can be used in the following ways:Option 1: 1 litre of spirit, 1 litre of wine, 1 litre of beerOption 2: 2 litres of wine, 1 litre of beerOption 3: 1 litre of wine, 2 litres of beerFrom April 1, travellers will have these options:Option 1: 1 litre of spirit, 1 litre of wineOption 2: 1 litre of spirit, 1 litre of beerOption 3: 1 litre of wine, 1 litre of beerOption 4: 2 litres of wineOption 5: 2 litres of beerThe conditions for purchasing duty-free liquor products will remain. The traveller must be above 18 years old and must have spent 48 hours or more outside Singapore before arrival.He or she must also not be arriving from Malaysia. The liquor product bought must be for the traveller’s own consumption and must be allowed for import to Singapore.WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT REDUCING THE DUTY-FREE ALLOWANCE?The move to reduce the amount of duty-free concessions is to ensure that the tax system is progressive, resilient and sustainable.“A fairer and more robust approach is (needed) to meet recurrent spending with recurrent revenues. Hence, we must continually review our tax system to ensure its resilience,” said Mr Heng.Mr Heng said that recurrent spending needs are in areas such as healthcare and pre-school education and security.These are ""necessary expenditures"" that must not be funded through borrowing, as borrowing ""shifts the burden of paying for today's needs onto future generations"". This is why the Republic needs to review its tax systems to ensure recurrent revenues are sustainable.Concession sales at major travel hubs in Singapore are increasing.In 2017, concession sales at Changi Airport grew 7.6 per cent from the year before to S$2.5 billion, “setting a new record”, according to Changi Airport Group.Travellers from China, Singapore, Indonesia, India and United Kingdom were the biggest group of spenders at Changi Airport, with Chinese and Singaporean shoppers accounting for more than half of the total sales.Liquor and tobacco are among the most popular product categories, along with perfumes and cosmetics.WHAT IS GST-IMPORT RELIEF?All goods brought into Singapore (other than exempt imports) are subject to GST at the prevailing rate of 7 per cent on the value of goods, which includes the cost, insurance and freight (CIF) plus other chargeable costs and the duty payable (if applicable).But travellers are given GST relief on new articles, souvenirs, gifts and food that they bring into Singapore for personal use and consumption. ""The GST import relief seeks to balance between collecting GST revenue and facilitating customs clearance at the borders,"" the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) and Singapore Customs said in a joint statement on Monday following Mr Heng's announcement.For goods that consumers import by parcel post, the GST relief for amounts up to S$400 per shipment remains. However, unlike goods purchased while you are overseas, if the value exceeds S$400, there is no GST relief, and GST is payable on the total value of the shipment.WHY DO I PAY GST ON THINGS BOUGHT OVERSEAS?This is because GST is a tax on the taxable supply of goods and services in Singapore and on the importation of goods into Singapore (other than an exempt import). That means that GST is levied on goods brought into Singapore or purchased locally. GST has been in force in Singapore since 1994.All goods, whether from commercial shipments (i.e. shipping of goods) or hand-carried by travellers, are subject to 7 per cent GST.Travellers are granted GST relief on goods imported for their own personal use and the amount is based on the value of goods they bring in and the period that they are away from Singapore. Travellers are required to pay GST on the value of the goods which is in excess of the GST relief granted to them.""They are advised to keep and produce the invoices or receipts of their purchases for computation and verification of the tax payable,"" said Iras and Singapore Customs, adding that it is the responsibility of travellers to make an accurate and complete declaration of the dutiable and taxable items in their possession. WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE?Failure to declare purchases subjected to GST or making an incorrect declaration constitutes an offence under the Customs Act and the GST Act.Those convicted can be fined up to S$10,000 or the equivalent of the amount of tax payable, whichever is greater, and/or face imprisonment for up to 12 months.Any person found guilty of fraudulent evasion of GST will be liable to a fine up to 20 times the amount of tax evaded and/or imprisonment for up to 2 years.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

"https://www.todayonline.com/big-read/big-read-why-singapore-has-yet-become-cycling-paradise-and-its-not-just-about-heatInteresting points mentioned in this article, however I would like to question a few statements:""If our population is already so dense, what are we going to do when we each have bikes?”Considering that bicycles have a significantly lower footprint than cars, removing car lanes to install cycling lanes can actually increase the carrying capacity by up to 12.5 times (source). Furthermore, car lanes are often excessively wide. We can keep the same amount of car lanes, yet make them narrower, resulting in enough space for a cycling lane while also lowering vehicle speeds, resulting in greater road safety.""Given how dense the city is, there is a certain limit for cycling.”Above arguments apply here too. Building for bikes (and PMDs) is actually is a smart thing in a dense city, as it can replace private vehicle (and taxi) trips and provide relief to underground and bus services. Singapore's population density is quoted at 7,796 people/km^2. Manhattan, with a population density of 25,846/km² (more than 3 times denser) has extensive and great cycling infrastructure and is continuing to build more (here, here, here, here and many more places).Singapore’s “hot and humid” weather is not conducive for cycling.The rise of e-scooters could alleviate this. E-scooters have all the same benefits as cycling, in terms of the small footprint, low societal impact, low energy requirements, low parking requirements (except for health benefits) while also providing sweat-free transport.With Singapore being a land-scarce city, creating safety boxes may not be a feasible option as well, he noted.Considering how little space those boxes take up, I find it hard to believe that there is not enough space for them. Furthermore, if we reduced the number surface-level car parks in Singapore (of which there are plenty), replacing them with underground parking garages, there should be plenty of space for cycling/PMD/walking infrastructure to expand.Furthermore, many roads currently already have plenty of ""wasted"" space, which could easily be converted into cycling/PMD lanes, without affecting existing traffic whatsoever. Examples can be found here Ulu Pandan Road, Duxton, but there is many more around our island.The opinions of these experts still reflect a mindset of designing roads to move cars, not people."
"My (admittedly highly subjective) opinion as a cycling commuter: Singapore (government) sees cycling only as leisure activity and not as a valid transport alternative:One must be exceedingly lucky that a PCN is the majority of one's way to work and backNewer areas where they introduce shared/dual sidewalks for cyclists and pedestrians are often almost an insult. The last one I saw around Tampines, the bike lane had those painted stripes to make the ride bumpy, and every 50m a warning sign or even a dismount sign wherever another walkway crossed or entered.10km/h is pointless for commuting, that's jogging speed.At least where I live and work, the street network is definitely made for cars. Big main roads to get into from one area to the next and within an area, a network of often dead ones to get to specific destinations. There are no meaningful parallel roads.Many people say that I'm stupid to cycle to work...and they might be right :)."
"I'm a cycling commuter too and can totally relate to everything you are saying! If all those people are right saying that you are stupid, I must be stupid too ;) I don't know who designs cycling paths that expect you to dismount and push every 300m for a bus stop. Certainly, that person has never commuted by bike in their life. I am a bit puzzled as to why LTA is not open to considering cycle path deisgns that are commonly and successfully implemented all around the world. They all follow a pretty standard recipe. There is independent organisations as well as open government data compiling the learnings of many experienced infrastructure developers on what makes great cycling infrastructure (backed up by successfully fostering a cycling culture in their own country) - and LTA follows none of them! Instead, they opt for developing an admittedly weird, proprietary approach. Fun fact! Cycling didn't use to contribute significantly to the modal share in he Netherlands even as recent as in the 60's and 70's - it was only through extensive development of accessible, safe and connected bike infrastructure that they developed their world famous cycling culture (Book: Building the Cycling City.Plus pedestrians just use red cycling paths as an extended sidewalk - who can blame them, considering how narrow the assigned walkway is! The funny thing is that even in concept images for the new North-South corridor, pedestrians are walking on the red cycling paths.As road safety conditions are exceedingly tiring to deal with, I have resorted to trying to find smaller parallel roads - unfortunately, even when I am willing to accept a commute that is often 2-3x longer than the actual distance, the side roads often end suddenly, lead in wrong directions or are blocked by condos. When cycling on the sidewalk for my own safety, I find that they are often terribly maintained, with pot-holes, frequent, very high curbs, random 90° angles and of course, way to little space to pass pedestrians safely (unless they are kind enough to step aside and let me pass - but I mostly feel to paiseh to ring my bell...).Admittedly, cycling might be a bit though to promote in Singapore, as there is a common perception that it is too hot (although by now, I have found ways to commute even in fancy attire without sweating). However, with the rise of e-scooters, I think there is a sizable population of ""bike-like"" transportation options, which should be considered in our transportation layout! I would consider getting an e-scooters myself, but the prohibitive laws make it totally unfeasible."
"You brought up another good point: Since cycling is not very popular -- again, with respect to daily commuting -- most decision makers and car drivers do not empathize with cyclist. Be it that continuous stops and dismounts on bumpy paths defeats the purpose, or be it just considered a second-class traffic participant. Getting constantly denied my right of way or overtaken with just 50cm to spare between me and a car is not fun."
"Totally agree. To commute by bike daily requires strong commitment - not because of the heat or the exertion (I cycle at a moderate pace) but because of interactions with drivers (pedestrians are in my experience very accommodating). There is days where I just feel to scared to go on the road, and the pavements here are in an abysmal state."
"Just out of curiosity, how do you commute in a fancy attire without sweating?"
"Well, it does require quite a lot of effort and planning, but once you have your daily routine, it really is no more troublesome than anything else. You don't need to spend tons of money on fancy equipment either.The biggest change was getting a bike rack and a bag, so that I wouldn't have to wear a backpack. Sounds simple, but the effect is tremendous! It is a very cheap solution and it keeps your back ventilated, minimising the amount of sweat.(this is optional but it did make a change) was having a bike with an upright seating position and gears. Nothing fancy, or expensive. But I used to commute on a fixie, and the bent-down seating + no gears was terrible for sweating.If you can, commute before 8:30am or after 17:30pm. Seriously, the thermal comfort is very different. If I commute from 7:45-8:15, the weather is positively comfortable (since the sun isn't very intense yet).Long pants are OK, button-up shirts are more tricky but still possible (jacket is a big no-no!). If you are wearing very fancy, your route will require more planning (see 5.)Planning my route. Longer routes are OK, if they can provide you with less uphills/more shade. Especially side roads are often significantly more shaded by trees and tall buildings (even more so before 8am). The sun is your enemy (as are hills!).If I have the time, I will wear a different shirt. Pants, shoes etc. can be really fancy, but try to wear a lofty, loose-fitting shirt (dry-fit will make your skin stink, choose quality cotton, or cotton+elastan). Once you reach, find a toilet and spend 30sec changing your top. Spray light deodorant and no one will ever assume you cycled to work!Cycle slower than you normally would. There is a speed that should seem naturally comfortable to you. Cycle a tad slower than that. The amount you sweat between your comfortable speed and being just a tad slower than that is enormous.Those are a few pointers to cycle to work while not having to shower or change (I can shower but prefer not to spend the time - so I minimise sweat instead!)"
"When I lived in the Netherlands I cycled to work every day. If you really want to there are ways to get around the temperate problems, like leaving earlier, when it's not so hot, or take a shower at the destination (from experience you will still sweat if it's freezing after cycling a while)I agree that cycling is a joke in Singapore compared to my home country, but it's better then a lot of other places. It's just unfortunate since it would fit the city very nicely.Unfortunately, the distance is now too large for me (16km). When I got here I expected I could get an electric bike, but they are mostly banned...I once cycled to East Coast Park and on the way the cycling path ended suddenly in the middle of nowhere. I could not find another way there that didn't involve cycling back for an hour. I ended up taking a taxi for like 300m so I could cross the highway."
"Thanks for sharing the experiences! I agree, the cycling network is not very conducive for cycling. I am not so much upset at how little cycling network there is (understandably, since it is only a recent effort), but rather, I am upset at how little thought is being put into the design of the infrastructure they are building at the moment. Prime example is what you mentioned here:the cycling path ended suddenly in the middle of nowhereImagine if your driving experience was like that, with the road suddenly ending nowhere. People certainly wouldn't be very keen on driving either. The porosity of the city and the level of the connection of the cycling network are very poor at the moment - consider Bencoolen street, where 200m of cycling path lead to...nowhere on both sides!There is very little thought being put into the overall experience of pedestrians and cyclists I feel, and this makes it unpleasant to walk or cycle.I expected I could get an electric bike, but they are mostly banned...I think it is ironic how 300hp, 2 ton steel machines are roaming around the city, while e-scooters and e-bikes are facing extensive restrictions for safety reasons...I think ultimately, the mode of transport is fairly irrelevant. People will just take whatever gets them from A to B most conveniently. If that is a big car, which enjoys full weather protection as well as the most extensive infrastructure around the city (where in Singapore can't you go by car, really?), people will enjoy driving. If it is an extensive and reliable train network, people will enjoy the freedom (hah!) of taking the train, since it allows them to read or sleep...and if it is the bicycle, because it is the least hassle and always at your side, people will do that. However, if the infrastructure for any of those modes is not developed, people will not like to take it.Cycling paths, like any other infrastructure, I think is really a ""build it, and they will come"" kinda thing. The rise in e-scooters has already shown the great demand for something that is less hassle (and cheaper!) than a car, yet more flexible than public transport. PMDs and bikes exactly fill this demand, and thus are perfectly suited for cities, especially considering their low impact on air quality, noise, parking (space) etc."
"Depending which route I take, it's between 6-9km (20-30min) for me, and I would consider this my upper limit. Luckily, I can shower at work and dress very casual, so no need for suits and such. And I certainly cycle around peak hours."
I notice alot of LTA ads on LinkedIn about cycling but it doesnt feel like they are taking it seriously. Would love to see more cycling paths in singapore
I still think that this is an outcome of the war on diabetes. :)
"but it doesnt feel like they are taking it seriouslyTotally agree! The infrastructure and all seems like they put very little though it in.I think any infrastructure is a ""build it and they will come"" kinda thing. Currently, the cycling network is tiny and unconnected, roads are incredibly unsafe to cycle on (this is not by nature - it's the driving culture) and the overall experience getting around by bike is just terrible - and this has nothing to do with the weather, which I have learnt tricks to deal with while cycling."
Can't tax cyclists. Can't make them pay COE. Still have to maintain roads for them. Of course I won't encourage cycling as a way of commuting la.
"Furthermore, car lanes are often excessively wide.Not in fucking Singapore they aren't."
"They actually are. In many places, especially the neighbourhoods, one lane is actually wide enough to accommodate for a vehicle at high speed AND a stopped vehicle (even though parking is prohibited). Another example is slip lanes, which despite having zebra crossing in-built and excessively wide, which encourages speeding. There is many examples but if you want to look for specific example, Dover Rise comes to mind - Google Maps tells me the lanes are 5m wide (lanes, not roads!)."

sometimes i have youtube playing in the background when i play on my PS4 and can't be bothered to move away from my game to skip ads - they're fucking annoying though. if anything it makes me less likely to buy/support whatever they are advertising.

Some of the gov ads are not badEsp the one by STB about travel insurance using old mediacorp clips and voice overs.

Still made me cringe a bit.
Watching ads on YouTube in 2019 LUL.
I can't install adblock on my Nintendo switch:(
Because some of the Singapore gov ads are actually good.

"Same, and the rap about drinking water is pretty fire also"
I honestly think that the OEM ads are pretty brilliant

"I do not understand why anyone is still watching ads in 2019. The last ad I ever watched was probably in 2013 (excluding that time I was dumb enough to go to a Singapore cinema screening ""on time"" and have to sit through 20 minutes of ads).You can watch YouTube through a browser. And on any browser, you can install AdBlock. There are also AdBlock browsers you can install (including on mobile). Any benefit the YouTube app has over watching YouTube on a browser is easily erased by the fact that you have to put up with the annoying ads."
No adblock for mobile users.There are definitly mobile browsers that supports add-ons but the user interface and experience is not as good as the mobile app itself.
"If you're on Android you can use YouTube Vanced. There's no ads, you can have playback even with the screen off, and the UI is the same as the normal app, but you can opt for dark modes"
"Youtube VancedBasically 'Youtube Advanced', but without the 'Ad'"
I specifically use AdBlock Browser on mobile to watch YouTube (and for no other purpose).
"The mobile layout for YouTube on Firefox is pretty much the same as the YouTube app, plus I have my adblocker on Firefox. So far works like a charm. I don't really know about speed though, I set my phone to connect to 2 and 3g only to save data so I'm kinda used to slow speeds already lol."
I do not understand why anyone is still watching ads in 2019.Maybe just maybe.. People want to support their favourite content creators. It's kinda sad that people expects high quality content for nothing these days.
"you're lying to yourself if you think the majority of people who still watch ads are doing it to support content creators, it's most likely them just being unaware of adblockers."
A far better way to support your favourite content creator is to donate $1 to her. That's the equivalent of watching thousands of ads during her videos.
Sure. Donating directly is one way of supporting. But that doesn't make my point invalid. And I highly doubt people that can't sit through an ad for a free content and can't see the benefits of ads to content creator are the kind of people that will donate even a dollar.
"Absolutely this point ^While I don’t work with content creators directly, I am in an adjacent industry and find people/consumers expect more and more while wanting to pay less and less, to the point where even sitting through a :15 ad is too much to ask for, evidently."
"Huge chunks of the web business is build on the foundation of serving ads to end users. People seem to think that everything is sprouted from nowhere and everything is already paid for. So, fuck ads yea?"
Hi could you advise on what AdBlocks work on incognito mode? Cos I function permanently on incognito on chrome.
It's the same with cinema ads here. Go to cinema and 3 or 4 of the ads are usually by government agencies. Govt agencies here seem to spend a lot more on advertising than any other country I've been to.
Sorry guys. I probably skewed the numbers by watching YouTube and fall asleep right after. Autoplay all night for that sweet sweet iPad warmth.

"Specifically, this is beside the longkang/PCN, sandwiched between Sembawang Park and Simpang where Water-Venture Sembawang and the Masjid are situated.I remembered this photo clearly. Cycling along the PCN and came across this small beach for the first time. Talked to some of the people living near Sembawang who were fishing at the moment - there were a lot of crabs and shrimps in these waters. The man heading down the jetty - whom I later understood having chatted to the people around - was a migrant worker from Thailand and was fishing in the waters with a net. He wasn't very successful - compared to the other anglers who were familiar with casting nets."

"Singapore Budget 2019: Smaller duty-free alcohol allowance and GST relief for overseas shoppingSINGAPORE - From Tuesday (Feb 19), returning travellers will have a smaller allowance on tax-exempt overseas shopping.Those who spend fewer than 48 hours outside Singapore will have to pay the 7 per cent goods and services tax (GST) on items bought abroad worth $100 and more, down from $150.The threshold will be lowered from $600 to $500 for travellers who spend 48 hours or more outside the country, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced on Monday (Feb 18), citing a rise in international travel.The alcohol duty-free concession will also be reduced, from three litres to two litres, starting on April 1.The cap on the allowance for spirits will remain at one litre. This means that, under the new rules, returning travellers will be entitled to only two litres of wine, beer or a combination of the two, or a litre of spirits and a litre of either wine or beer duty-free.Currently, adults who spend two days or more outside the country, excluding those returning from Malaysia, are allowed to buy a litre of spirits, wine and beer each.The GST is a broad-based tax that contributes significantly to Singapore's fiscal resources, said Mr Heng, and the moves will help recurrent revenues to meet recurrent spending needs in areas such as healthcare, pre-school education and security.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

"Govt to invest more to protect S’pore against climate change & rising sea levelsMinister of Finance, Heng Swee Keat announced in his Budget 2019 speech that the government will plan to invest more for Singapore to adapt to climate change.AdvertisementPlanning for climate change & rising sea levelsAs part of the speech, Heng acknowledged Singapore’s vulnerability to climate change and rising sea levels.“Climate change and rising sea levels threaten our very existence. As a low-lying nation-state, there’s nowhere to hide when sea levels rise.”Using the Maldives as an example, he highlighted that this global phenomenon should not be taken lightly as other small island nations are already facing the implications of climate change, such as the risk of flooding.As such the government will be studying the implications carefully and implement preventive measures to protect Singapore adequately.Carbon tax will also be applied to this year’s emissions to signal companies and households to reduce emission and adopt energy-efficient practices.AdvertisementProtecting coastal infrastructureThe Climate Action Plan was charted out in 2016 to set out mitigating and adaptive measures for climate change, especially on infrastructure.Heng announced that roads along low-lying coastal areas have to be raised and critical infrastructures like the Terminal 5 have to be built at 5.5m above mean sea level.This is higher than other newly reclaimed lands that have to be raised to four metres above mean sea level since 2011.Polders and dikes are also piloted on Pulau Tekong to help us learn how to deal with rising sea levels.AdvertisementInvest moreAlthough it is difficult to project spending needs way into the future, Heng announced that the government will have to invest more to prepare Singapore for climate change.Together with the existing infrastructure needs, this will increase the total spending on infrastructure significantly.Different ministries have done preliminary estimates to develop fiscal plans in advance to finance long-lived major infrastructure.Zero Waste Master Plan will be rolled out in the second half of 2019 by the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources.Heng also said that each generation contributes a fair share on measures against climate change.AdvertisementTop photo collage from CNA video and Clean and Green Singapore0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

"Singapore Budget 2019: $6.1b for Merdeka Generation package includes Medisave top-ups, higher Chas subsidiesSINGAPORE - A total of $6.1 billion will be set aside under the Merdeka Generation Package, the bulk of which will go towards easing the burden of healthcare costs for nearly 500,000 Singaporeans.Announcing details of the much talked-about package during his Budget Statement on Monday (Feb 18), Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat called it a ""gesture of our nation's gratitude"" for those in that generation who are now aged between 60 and 69.""It will provide them better peace of mind over future healthcare costs, while helping them to stay active and healthy,"" he said.Starting this year, those in the Merdeka Generation will receive a $200 Medisave top-up every year until 2023. They will also get higher subsidies under the Community Health Assist Scheme (Chas) and an extra 25 per cent discount on their bills at polyclinics and specialist outpatient clinics.They will also get between 5 and 10 per cent off their MediShield Life premiums, as well as an extra ""participation incentive"" of $1,500 if they choose to join the national disability insurance scheme CareShield Life.And to support their active lifestyles, the Government will give this group a one-off $100 top-up to their PAssion Silver concession cards. This money can be used to pay for public transport, entry to public swimming pools and activities at community clubs, among other things.Mr Heng estimated that the package will cost more than $8 billion, in current dollars, over the Merdeka Generation's lifetimes. The $6.1 billion set aside during this year's Budget will, with interest accumulated over time, cover the package's full projected costs, he said.Related Story A pleasant surprise for the Merdeka GenerationRelated Story Singapore Budget 2019: Follow live blogRelated Story Budget 2019: More storiesThe oldest people in the Merdeka Generation are now 69 years old, and will be able to enjoy the benefits for ""many more years"", Mr Heng said.He added that the Finance and Health ministries have taken this into account when sizing the Budget for these benefits.""This is a significant commitment by the Government,"" he said. ""It is important that the Government of the day continues to monitor the patterns and cost of healthcare utilisation, and life expectancy over the next 30 years or more, so that the Government is able to meet this commitment,"" he said.The Merdeka Generation Package comes five years after $8 billion was set aside during Budget 2014 for the Pioneer Generation Package.Chas subsidies under the new package will be higher than subsidies for lower-income blue Chas cardholders. All in the Merdeka Generation will be able to get these subsidies regardless of income, even if they don't have a Chas card today.They will also receive an extra 5 per cent off their annual MediShield Life premiums, which will go up to 10 per cent after they turn 75. This is on top of the existing means-tested subsidies that lower and middle-income Singaporeans get.The Health Ministry had previously announced participation incentives of $2,500 for people born before 1960 if they joined the CareShield Life insurance scheme. The new $1,500 incentive for those in the Merdeka Generation means that they will get a total of $4,000 each if they join.The money will cover a significant portion of premiums, and is on top of the regular means-tested premium subsidies, Mr Heng said.Singaporeans aged 50 and above this year, and who are not eligible for either the Merdeka or Pioneer Generation packages, will also get an extra Medisave top-up of $100 a year for the next five years. This is to help them with their future healthcare expenses, Mr Heng said.Those who were born in the 1950s and who obtained citizenship by 1996 will be eligible for the Merdeka Generation Package. Those born in 1949 and earlier will also get the package if they missed out on the Pioneer Generation Package, as long as they got citizenship by 1996.People who are eligible will be notified by April and start getting their Merdeka Generation cards from June. More details will be shared during the debate on the Health Ministry's spending plans.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

"TLDR those who invested will get 3% cash and 7% value in stocks back.Means if you had $10,000 of bond, then you only get $300 cash and stocks worth about $700 (which will definitely drop immediately once everyone sells).Ouch..."

"To be fair, the CEO and board of directors gave up their shares to repay investors.But unlikely that the shares are worth much anyway..."
"gave up their shares to repay investors.Sounds like a nice way of saying ""bye I'm out, good luck with this company, you can have it"""
Didn't follow this news. Saw a headline on edmw that Lum drew 60m bonus?
Probably for last year
"Seems like it's the cumulative dividends of a decade, from 2007 to 2016.https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/group-ceo-olivia-lum-did-not-get-s60m-dividends-2017-says-hyflux-response-investor"
How is that fair when the company is losing money and heavily in debt... While she drew a high income of a million dollars and an annual dividend bonus of 60m for herself? Selfish lady.
Wah painful
It's always the small investors who get shafted.
"Yeah, I wonder if anyone has invested significant sums in them."
This is so damned jialat... It’s like Swiber all over again... or the Lehman minibonds saga from 2008/2009. Please diversify your investment portfolio. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.
More like don't get greedy and think that you'll definitely get a 6% return.
True true....
I still remember the banks were pushing this crap to their clients. Poor retirees tempted by the 6% offered by one of the 30 biggest companies in Singapore.
"I remember being a student then. My peers were saying with absolute certainty - “government won’t let hyflux die one, water very important, don’t invest you lose”Talk so big, now very quiet. Curiously enough none of them seem to be affected. Still living the good life. Just goes to show that it’s only talk. Never put the money where their mouths were."
Well it's entirely possible that govt won't let hyflux die but it doesn't mean that you can get any profits from buying their shares
Maybe they just hide their losses from you cos they scared lose face if they admit they made a wrong investment decision and lost big time
"Hyflux cannot invest one, many years ago people already said too much debt and commitment, too little cash. It going down is only matter of time."
Got sauce?
So much for blue chip stocks being a safe buy.
isnt that always the case? spoils goes to ones with the most power
"Hyflux reorganisation plan will see heavy losses for small investorsHyflux has set out a reorganisation plan to keep the water treatment firm going but which could have investors suffering heavy losses.The 34,000 registered holders of Hyflux perpetual securities and preference shares, who are owed $900 million, will receive a total of $27 million in cash and a 10.26 per cent share of the reorganised company.Under its long-awaited restructuring plan, filed with the High Court yesterday, unsecured creditors who are not holders of perpetual securities and preference shares will receive 27 per cent of shares, and a total cash distribution of $232 million.This means that for every $1,000 invested, a holder of Hyflux’s perpetual securities and preference shares will recover just $106.54, or an implied return rate of 10.7 per cent - from $30.15 in cash and $76.39 of implied value in Hyflux shares.For medium-term noteholders, who are of a higher priority on the creditors’ list, the implied return rate is 24.6 per cent, or $246.35 for every $1,000 invested. This is from a cash payout of $138.72 and $107.63 in Hyflux shares.The bulk of Hyflux's share capital, about 60 per cent, will go to SM Investments (SMI), a consortium of Indonesia's conglomerate Salim Group and energy giant Medco Group. SMI has agreed to invest $530 million in the firm.Of Hyflux's total debt amounting to almost $3 billion, $717 million is owed to unsecured bank creditors, while $915 million is owed to unsecured contingent creditors and $271 million to medium-term noteholders.Chief executive Olivia Lum and the company's board members have offered to give up their entire stakes and entitlements as holders of preference shares and perpetual capital securities to all other holders of preference shares and perpetual capital securities once the plan is completed.The company maintained that its medium-term noteholders and 29 bank creditors, and those who hold perpetual securities and preference shares, would get more under the proposed restructuring plan than if the firm were to go into liquidation.Ms Lum said the proposed scheme aims to ""revitalise its businesses"" and allow the restructuring to take place in an orderly manner.The plan needs to be approved by creditors, including perpetual securities and preference shareholders.Then an extraordinary general meeting will be held for ordinary shareholders to approve the issue of new shares to SMI, where more than 50 per cent of them must vote ""yes"" for the issue of new shares to SMI and the waiver of a general offer.A spokesman for Hyflux's financial adviser told reporters yesterday: ""We appreciate that the outcome is very difficult, given the size of the potential losses, but this is the best option we have.""Related Story Hyflux in hot water: 6 things about embattled CEO Olivia LumRelated Story Hyflux can gain up to $258m working capitalRelated Story Hyflux CEO Olivia Lum offers to contribute her entire stake in company under restructuring planHe said they were hopeful people would understand what was being offered as better than alternatives, which include liquidation.Noting that no one else had made a better offer, he said the Salim-Medco consortium would make a good partner for Hyflux, with their extensive involvement in the water and energy sectors, and would bring their existing business connections and synergies to Hyflux.Post-restructuring, he said, the company would be almost debt-free, have a stronger balance sheet and a strong strategic partner.Its fortunes today are a far cry from what they were in 2001, when it became the first water treatment company to be listed in Singapore. Hyflux's profile in the global water industry grew, winning it contracts in China, India and the Middle East.But analysts say Hyflux may have taken on too many capital-intensive projects with long lead times, borrowed too much and was too optimistic with its projections. Its debts reached a tipping point when it was unable to divest its expensive desalination and power plant Tuaspring and another in Tianjin.Ms Lum said yesterday she and the board are ""deeply aware of, and empathise with"" stakeholders' unhappiness, and they had spent much time and effort to negotiate and secure a deal to save Hyflux.In her affidavit, she said they would return their stakes to the pool to be distributed solely to the holders of perpetual securities and preference shares.Ms Lum has a stake of 267 million Hyflux shares and securities; it represents about 34 per cent of the company's ordinary shares.""In this way, it is my hope they may reap the future benefits which the Salim-Medco consortium deal can offer them,"" she said.At least one investor is resigned to the deal. Preference shareholder Lee Wai Leong said: ""Retail creditors have to accept that they may never get back 100 per cent of the principal even if the shares appreciate under Salim's watch. Banks have written off the loans. Retail preference and perpetuals shareholders have to do the same. They have to let go.""0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

"Happened before and will happen again. Greedy always blinds some people. With all the red flags, should have sold way before."
"Hi r/singapore, my focus this week will be on a very special gliding mammal that can be found in Singapore, the Malayan Colugo.Colugos are also called flying lemurs, although they do not actually fly, nor are they lemurs. They are classified within their own family the Cynocephalidae (literally ‘dog-head’) within the mammalian order Dermoptera (literally ‘skin wing’), and are thought to be the closest living relatives of primates. There are 2 living species of Colugo, found only in Southeast Asia – the Malayan or Sunda Colugo, which is known from Indochina, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Borneo, Sumatra, and Java, and the Philippine Colugo, which is endemic to the Philippines.In Singapore, the Malayan Colugo lives in the forests in and around Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Central Catchment Nature Reserve, Bukit Batok Nature Park, and Bukit Brown Cemetery. Compared to other forest mammals, they're not very rare, and seem to occur in high densities in some areas of suitable habitat. Some of my favourite places to spot Colugos are Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Hindhede Nature Park, Dairy Farm Nature Park, Windsor Nature Park, the trails around MacRitchie Reservoir, and the Lower Peirce Boardwalk.The Malayan Colugo is nocturnal and herbivorous, feeding mostly on young leaves of various forest trees. It is also known to consume young shoots, flowers and fruit, and tree sap. You can find Colugos on trees during the day during your morning walk in the forest; they're usually clinging to the trunks of trees, or hanging from branches. You might even spot a mother with young - the baby clings to its mother's underside, and is usually hidden beneath its mother's gliding membrane, but you'll often see its head sticking out. So adorable.If you visit the Zoo, do look out for Colugos - they're completely wild, but the landscaping within the Zoo compound seems to provide suitable habitat and food plants for them, and they can be seen resting on trees along the paths and around the enclosures. For some reason, Colugos just don’t survive for very long in captivity, and so they aren’t held in any zoological collections.Colugos have the most extensive patagium (gliding membrane) of any gliding mammal - it stretches from the neck to the front paws, connects the front paws and the hind paws, and hind paws to the tip of the tail. A gliding Colugo is basically an animated flying carpet, and they really are superb gliders, capable of gliding more than 130 metres, while only losing 10 metres of altitude.However, the patagium also means that the Colugo isn’t able to walk or run like most other mammals, and can only move about by hopping. A grounded Colugo that can’t get to a tree is quite helpless and vulnerable to predators. Sometimes a Colugo is unlucky enough to land on the ground instead, and has to quickly scramble towards and up the nearest tree. If it lands on a road, it might become roadkill. I’ve also seen video clips of gliding Colugos accidentally colliding with motorcyclists and cyclists while gliding across roads. And for those living next to the forest, you might end up having a Colugo crash into your window or land on your balcony, and in need of rescue.Feel free to ask any questions you might have about Colugos, and I'll try to answer them to the best of my ability. You can also share your own stories and anecdotes, or suggest other animals for me to cover in future.Previous edition: Monitor Lizards"
"Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley came to Singapore a while back to study Colugos, and a local researcher published a book all about them; it should still be available in the libraries.Colugos are often thought to be silent, but they do make noises, usually when communicating with one another, or making distress calls. It’s also possible that Colugos may communicate using ultrasound frequencies.Like I mentioned, traditionally, only 2 species of Colugo are known, the Malayan Colugo and Philippine Colugo. However, genetic evidence suggests that there may be more species; a study in 2008 suggested that at least the Javan and Borneo populations (usually considered to be Malayan Colugo) might be distinct from populations in mainland Southeast Asia, but a more recent paper has identified even more genetically distinct lineages in both the Malayan and Philippine Colugos that could eventually be classified as separate species.Here are a couple more clips of gliding Colugos; this one's from BBC's Planet Earth series, while this one shows a Colugo gliding above a cyclist(?) in Mandai.And finally, I was one of several people who was fortunate enough to witness this fight between two Colugos at Bukit Batok Nature Park."
Colugos are very cute. Your anecdote about them chillin in the zoo but dying if locked up is pretty funny. Just wanna appreciate the work you do here in this subreddit. You make this place a better one.Are you mainly an animal expert or can you teach us about trees as well?
Thanks so much for the compliments.My expertise is in animals; I think u/Stimulicious has trees and other flora covered with the new series on local plants
Was just reading about this in my GES textbook! Thanks for the additional information!
You mentioned that they are vulnerable to predators if they can't get to a tree. What predators do colugos have here in Singapore?
"Reticulated Pythons are known to eat Colugos, and I'm sure a large monitor lizard like a Malayan Water Monitor wouldn't hesitate to go after one that was on the ground. Another major predator of Colugos are large birds of prey like the Changeable Hawk-eagle and in the Philippines, the Philippine Colugo is an important part of the diet of the Philippine Eagle. And while we don't have big cats and other large terrestrial mammalian predators, feral dogs in our forests certainly pose a threat to Colugos. Apparently there are also records of Long-tailed Macaques preying on Colugos, although I need to check whether it's a case of monkeys actively hunting a Colugo, or just opportunistically snatching and eating a young one."
"May I suggest placing links to all parts of the series in the post?Somehow it’s Part 15 now and I have missed all previous 14 parts. Of course I can click on all Previous Edition links, and I will. Just a suggestion.Thanks for your series!Edit: Never mind, saw your explanation in previous edition. “I used to list every edition, but that triggered the spam filter, so I've structured it such that every new edition links to the previous one, so you can go all the way back to the very first one I did.”"
There are also nocturnal flying squirrels in Singapore! (https://m.singapore.biodiversity.online/taxon/A-Vert-Mamm-Rodentia-Sciuridae)Flying lemurs are probably more common: anecdotally I've spotted colugos several times but never a flying squirrel.
"Oh yes! I mentioned flying squirrels when I covered squirrels a few weeks ago.Flying squirrels are nocturnal, hide in tree hollows during the day, and mostly stick to dense forests in the nature reserves, so most people never get the chance to see them. But one species, the Horsfield's Flying Squirrel, has been spotted in Bukit Batok Nature Park, so it's possible that people walking there at night might cross paths with one."
Ive never seen one before! Would they be high in the trees or can you spot them at eye level ish?
"They're mostly quite high up on tree trunks, closer to the crown. However, I've also seen some that choose to just rest on the tree trunk around 2 metres or so off the ground."
Is there still any chance to go SISPEC or get 3SG in unit life? Like for those that failed to go in command sch aft bmt
"Don't get too hung up on ranks. If they up rank you in unit, means they wanna throw you shit to do but you not high rank enuff for that appointment.So in army... Don't be spec. Just be men or officer."
"yes you can be promoted to 3SG without going to command school, subjected to approval from your CO"
Role dependent too. So far in my unit I've only seen one of the storeman promoted to 3sg
mine was a staff branch asa...
"Sorry I think I mention wrongly. Is appointment based. The store man who got promoted seemed to be in charge of 2 other guys, who did most of the admin/logistics work. So he was given. As for the other guys in my unit, highest was CFC only for men"
Have to be cfc level or depend on supply and demand for the unit?
"Getting CFC is already so difficult, 3SG will be insanely tough"
"Just drop the idea lolHad the same passion and fire as you.Unit life snuffed that out quickly. Nothing you do matters, extra efforts by you will always be cushioned by negative efforts on your unit mates.You'll become your superior's good friends and nothing more."
Rip sounds like unit life is going to be a depressing drag of 2 years
"Depends on unit. For air force, yes, can be done, but you must perform well in unit. For army, highly doubt so unless you were already posted as a CQMS (Supply sup) or transport sup. Not sure about navy though."
"Mai la, either be the lowest or highest. Man/officer. Sgt kena stuck in the middle sibeh jialat."
"Simisai, someone downvoted everyone in this thread for no reason??"
"Happens in this sub a lot, idk why though"
"First day on r/sg meh, trigger sg redditors very easy one, either talk about ns and support it. Or talk about grab and support it too.Instant downvote galore 😂"
Hahaha i never noticed so blatantly
"My own experience in NS was that. I was a CQ (storeman spec). I was in pes A/B1 BMT and down pes-ed to C. Was thrown around a bunch of camps before I got my final posting to be a CQ. Was not in SCS at all until combined arms term, which is basically just preparing for the graduation parade."
"Hi, got my enlistment letter. Says to come to BMTC Sch V at Kranji Camp II, I'm PES C. Any advice on what to bring, what you do there, what the camp is like etc? Thanks."
"Just completed mine there :) Am PES C9First Phase: Modified BMTThey will send you another packing list when you’re nearer the enlistment date. If you’re stayout, the things on the packing list should be enough. If stay in and you like your laundry neat, bring about 4-6 hangers and Febreze. Because you will be swapping between outfits rather often.Eg. Long 4 -> PT Kit -> Smart 4Alot of us like to have a folded Smart 4 ready so we don’t need to fold again when we need it, hence the need for hangers.Oh and you can bring your favourite toiletries if you prefer. For me it was comfortable for me to use my own Dettol body soap during BMT. I personally probably didn’t use the soap they provided at all but your preference is most important :)You most likely will know if you’re stay in or stayout only on the first few days of enlisting so be prepared to stay in a couple of days or even the whole duration of the BMT. If you already know you’re staying out, then that’s great :DSecond Phase: Vocational TrainingThere will be this Friday where everyone assembles at the driveway and you are all assigned to your respective vocations. You either remain in camp or travel on chartered buses to your new location depending on vocation.I can only speak for the ASA (Clerk) course because I am one. If you’re posted to be trained as an ASA or SA(GE) (Storeman) then its lessons everyday for you in aircon room :) Just enjoy yourself!I’m not so sure about the other vocations but the feedback seems not bad as well.Do enjoy the company with your fellow enlistees! At times you may sweat abit more, other times you are in bunk resting so don’t worry too much :D"
Will you need to see MO again when you go Kranji?
"Depends. For me I didn’t need to as I cleared all of the enhanced medicals at CMPB already, prior to enlisting.But a number of my fellow section mates needed to see the MO again as there were a few outstanding medical items for them :)"
What are enhanced medicals?
"Like heart examination at National Heart Centre, extra blood tests, urine tests, psychiatric tests etc"
Paisehh one more question. What were the outstanding medical items for your friends?
"From what I recall, mainly, a number of them needed to take an extra blood test"
"Thanks for the answer. My enlistment letter says 'since this is a stay-in course...' so I guess I'm stay-in? I'm just confused about the packing list and the items they issue...like it says the No 4 uniform they only give 1 piece? How are you supposed to wear it everyday then? Do you just wash and dry every single day? And I'm not sure how many civilian clothes and all that I need to bring haha.How's ASA btw? I've heard it's slack and you don't do much but in your free time what are you even allowed to do? Can you bring books, use phone, play instruments?Oh and how much do you think I should train? I'm overweight but how bad would the training be? I'm also PES C9. I actually thought I could lose weight during NS but since people say they're very strict about safety I don't know if it's possible now..like you can't run etc"
"I got 3 sets of No 4, not to worry. People either wash and dry (dries overnight, there's a laundry area in the dorms) or leave for a few days and wash. Civilian clothes as far as I know you only need one set and only in the first week. Will not be required following that.Currently doing ASA course now and honestly it's really really slack with lots of admin time. Phone is allowed in bunk, books and instruments are fine to my knowledge. Basically anything goes but computers as far as I know, and they rarely do bag checks anyway.Training will probably be up to you. Don't expect to lose much weight here unless you train on your own accord (either in bunk or ask for permission to do PT during admin time). The PT they give is fairly limited and they're very safety minded so you may not lose much weight at all unless you are disciplined (and don't take so much from the cookhouse because they tend to dump a lot of food)."
"Oh I see...how hard is it to get permission to do PT? And for the no 4 uniform you get it on enlistment right, no need to buy anything now? So basically most of the clothes you wear during BMT I guess you get it there right? And for washing do you have to do by hand or are there washing machines?Good to know about instruments being allowed...would you know anything about whether you can bring amplifiers for electric guitar? I guess there's no wall plugs but if it was battery operated and you used headphones do you think that would be fine?Thanks for the all the info btw."
"Oh ya just to add on, wtv they state in the packing list that they mail you in the future, should be enough no matter if you’re stay in or stay out :)"
Oh okay sure haha thanks. Oh and did you bring any powerbanks? My phone runs out of charge quickly and I don't want to not be able to call my parents ;-;
Yes please bring sufficient power banks and charger head as well. When sergeants are not inspecting you can use the head but if you get caught you are also fully liable
"I think the sergeants (in Alpha as least) are understanding enough that they'd let you do PT or supervise you.Uniforms you get on enlistment, you pretty much don't need to bring anything other than hangers and whatever they write there. Washing is done by hand so bring detergent/washing powder.No clue about amps. I think if you asked they may consider but it may be a bit bulky to bring back and forth so it may not be allowed. At one point I was considering bringing a digital keyboard (piano) but decided against it in the end. Btw there are a couple wall plugs in most bunks but you're technically not allowed to use it (a lot of people do anyway)."
Ohh okay thanks. For the uniforms if they don't have your size (i.e overweight) then what happens? What do you wear till they get you something that fits? Oh and what happens if they see you using the plugs then haha I'm surprised people still use it.And is there anyway to know what company I'll be in?
"The uniforms are fit to you most of the time from when you went to CMPB for medical checkup so don't worry about that. If any of your equipment doesn't fit (helmet, ilbv, boots, shoes, shirts/pants) you can still go down and change the size while the vendors are in camp.I've never seen anyone get caught for the plugs but honestly the sergeants are so chill they may just ask you to keep it and give you a warning.No way to know I think, though usually Alpha company comes in one day earlier than Bravo, so if you have any friends who are a day earlier or later than you you can probably guess."
"Yup, officially it’s a stay in course but a number of us are excused stay in (stayout) too!"
Ohh I see. When do you know if you're excused stay out?
"During the first 5 days! The Officer will call you down for interview and he will let you know. This interview is mandatory for all enlistees.If he doesn’t tell you, it might mean you’re stay in, but best is to ask him :) They are quite open to questions so if you have any doubts presently you can clarify when you enlist."
"Oh thanks! But initially you're confined for the first weekend and can book out the next right? e.g I enlist on Friday, have to stay for Saturday and Sunday and the next Saturday I can book out.And what's the interview for besides to tell you if you're stay out or in? What do they ask? Can you appeal for stay out if they don't give it to you?"
"YesThey ask you how you’re doing, check with you any external issues which SAF can render assistance, or any concerns you might have with BMT.Almost 0% chance the commanding officers and sergeants grant you stay out because this decision is made by the MO, the doctor in camp."
"To add on, if you wanna appeal for stay out, you can appeal to the MO or your OC.However, before appealing, your own Section Commanders, Platoon Sergeant and Platoon Commander has to approve first.If you wanna talk to the OC, you have to let your direct superiors know first and never skip the chain of command"
Thanks. Is appealing to the MO directly also skipping the chain of command though?
"Somewhat. If you visited him to report sick and subsequently appealed for stayout, then no.But if u visit him directly to appeal for stayout without first asking your commanders, then yes, its skipping the chain of command"
"Ohh I see okay thanks. Yeah idk if I want stay out or stay in anyway, the camp isn't exactly nearby. Either way I guess as with all things related to NS I probably have to just accept it regardless."
"Check out this thread, since it's someone enlisting for PES C BMT in April which is the same period as you:https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aev7ic/pes_c_kranji_camp/There are another 2 threads posted this week for PES C Kranji Camp BMT which might be a good read as well:https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aq4onc/enlisting_in_pes_c2_tomorrow_morning_what_to/https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aqjojf/heading_into_ns_tomorrow_what_to_expect_from_bmt/"

"Hello, I wonder how is the field camp experience for people in the new BMTC V ? Mine was the last few batch to go in Tekong as pesC. All the ferry ride to n from Tekong was pain in the ass... and do you all go to Tekong for range?"
"Very good actually, depends on perspective. Abit ashamed to say this but outfield was good because where we slept is a little different ;)Not sure if i can share where we slept though so I’ll just leave it as that.Can’t recall if range was at Tekong but grenade was at Tekong"
"Uhhh I’m from the first batch of BMTC Sch V, PES C, AMA"
Is there a need to dig shell-scrape for field camp? And is there live-firing and grenade throwing?
"There is shell scrape depending on your specialisation and schedule, but don’t worry it’s quite easy as the one during my batch, one company dig one. Yes there’s live firing and grenade throwing"
"Do you have to go to tekong for outfield, live firing etc? And if you do (besides outfield) do you have to stay there a few nights or is it just go, do the stuff, and come back on the same day?"
"As for outfield, it’s quite funny haha, it’s just a few meters outside your bunk, where there’s a patch of grass. It’s usually 2 days 1 night, come back after one night, usually around 4pm end already then your sergeant will tell u to wash up, rest get ready for dinner etc, the outfield is not really Xiong uh, quite fun actually.As for live firing, for me it was in an air conditioned room, and the grenade throwing is in Tekong, it’s the ONE TIME you’ll ever get to go to Tekong, that is unless you’re posted out there uh"

Oh that's good. Lol I don't really wanna go to Tekong that's why I'm asking haha. I hope it's the same for my batch (?)
We didn’t stay overnight in Tekong for live firing and grenade throw but be prepared for anything!
Pes C2 or C9? I'm from the current serving batch
"Yep, in all honesty, just take it like going to school, and try to stay safe. If you can't do it, don't overdo it"
C9. You did the new BMT then?
"Are you enlisting in May?(I not trying to doxx, I want to know whether enlistment letter is given for may enlistment)"
"No, April."
when did you get it?
Only recently. btw if you look at this site https://www.cmpb.gov.sg/web/portal/cmpb/home/before-ns/enlistment-dates it shows you all the BMT dates for the next 6 months. Yes there's enlistment dates for May.
I know but I not sure when May enlistee get their letter. I was hoping to go into May so I guess it's around 2 month before enlistment date I may get the letter.
"Yeh it's 2 months. So you'd get it in March then. But you said in another comment u haven't finished poly, so I don't think you can get your enlistment date before that."
true.
"hmm might wanna check with CMPB, like call their hotline or something. Recall stories of people posting here how they were almost left out of the database or something"
I haven't finish poly
Poly batch usually enlist in June - August.
Find something to keep you occupied because you will have lots of admin time.
"Can you bring instruments? I like to play guitar, I'm scared they won't let me bring one in."
I'm in BMTC V right now - I've seen people bring guitars in so probably alright. Though it's probably annoying because everyone will want to borrow it and pass around.Edit: if there are any other questions feel free to ask! Overall I'd say you should just relax and not worry too much because it's really not a difficult course (I'm also C9)
"Oh thanks. How are the officers there? Someone else said they are approachable, want to know your experience? Like if you want to ask them about things like MC, or bringing instruments in and so on and how much do they punish you? Do they make you do pushups as punishment?"
"Honestly the officers and section commanders are all really nice, at least in Alpha. Bravo I've heard is a little more strict (bag checks etc), but they won't ask you to do pushups most of the time (but it does happen sometimes). If you're asking a genuine question I don't think they'd punish you in any way."
"The officers here are very hardcore about safety, so dont be a cock and do stuff like sprinting around and breaking your foot by falling into drains. The punishment for safety violations is pretty severe, but your officers will try to keep you out of trouble with the MPs for other petty stuff like pornography possession, who will dish out even worse punishments.Yeah and the officers are surprisingly approachable, and none of that “cancel MO's mc” bullshit. That said, don't jump the command chain, not that there is a need to here."
"Thanks for the answer, I guess safety is something that worries everyone now with all the news.."
Goddamn that's beautiful. Thought it was a painting at first
"Sadly, I doubt it will be a real comeback.IMO, Creative has always produced very good quality (in terms of audio and specs) relative to their competition. However, they are absolutely terrible at marketing and design, which seems to be what drives sales to mainstream consumers these days."
"I have one, was given to me as a Christmas gift. while it does what it claims to, it is a real hassle to use. Moreover it has a relatively high price point and the sound quality depends on your set of headphones."
"It's also the first step.Creative have been (used to be?) pioneers in sound tech, it will just get better (hopefully)"
their sound cards are still consider top end I think.
"I've been indoctrinated introduced to Creative by my dad, and so far for audio stuff I usually go Creative or Sony. Can't say if there had been any bad experiences so far. Most of them are sort of pricey, but they last long and sound great."
dont their headphones cup peel over time?
"Not sure for the ones for music (I've a Sony), but I have a Creative I believe H7 for video gaming. Been a couple years and still look like day 1."
yeah my $30 creative headset like peeled after a few month and theres debris everywhere.
"I don't think I'll pay $30 for anything and expect it not to peel though... Price seem way too low, especially for audio peripherals market where they're marked up quite a bit."
So what I bought is above the price? Is there a good headset available or am I gonna have to shell out a couple thousand on something that'll last?
"For below 50sgd there are a lot of surprisingly good quality Chinese headsets in the market, honestly just go on taobao and find their most sold model for your price range, it's probably decent. If you're willing to shell out a little more there's loads of option for under 100 bucks from big brands as well. I'm not much of an audiophile but a decent pair of headset for moderate video gaming should be easily achieved in this budget."
Whats your budget? There are quite a few options.
That would be as meaningful as a company producing top end typewriters.
not really it's more like saying they manufacture the key switch for keyboard but no longer sell keyboards.
"they have this at popular as a demo set. I tried it but i find the benefits marginal, however did not do the whole ear and face modelling part so that might make some difference.One thing this video didn't mention is that Creative has plans to go the OEM route. This is definitely the right way to go imo, and if done right, could spell a real comeback for them."
Has anyone actually used it? I hear a lot of hype but anyone give it a try and compare?
I tested it yesterday and yes it does have multi directional sound. The only downside is that there is no subwoofer in the headphones so you cannot feel the low frequency when watching movies. I am only referring to movies as I did not test music files. I suggest you go try it at the upcoming IT show to get a complete evaluation.
"Cool, thanks. I’ll keep an eye out"
"Still, wrong product at wrong time. When everyone is going Bluetooth..."
"Eh, im yet to find a Bluetooth headphone that matches anything close to a good dac/amp driven pair"
Yes except the market largely ignores those things. Creative don’t even have the brand name to “certify” phones or mobile devices like Dolby.
"Bro, the target market are audiophiles, not the general market that only understand Beats and apple airpods as the only viable audio accesories and look at you weird when you explain to them DAC or amps"
"Dude, what? SG has a big audiophile scene. Yes not everyone needs good gear but there are a lot of people here who are into a variety of brands and tiers"
The thing is going cordless is the future. More and more phones are removing the audio jack so there will be less demand for physical headphones.
"Even while bluetooth has gotten to tht the point that it is on par with analog, the same prob still applies - the dependance on battery and having to charge them everynight.All you need is to forget to charge them and your headphones are just useless. Analog never has tht issue, and they dont need batteries , so they are less bulky and lighter."
Its not of a question as what is empirically better but the more popular choice. If it is more popular it will be adopted much more readily. Like the iPhones or US Presidents.
"More phone manufacturers are removing the headphone jack is not because bluetooth is better, it could be the case but thats is not the reason, that is the solution for having audio in jackless phonesThey remove it because it supposedly frees up space for phone manufacturers to cram more stuff into phones, and also it supposedly makes phone more waterproof (dont think that makes sense since samsung was able to do it with S8 S9 even with a analog port). Bluetooth headphones may be a step forward but they are also a PR move to get users used to jackless phones.Putting on my tinfoil hat, why they remove the headphone jack is to sell more expensive bluetooth accessories like airpods, and make you pay for dongles and licensed accessories that 3rd party accessories make."
they have a Bluetooth version though.
It's also overrated imo.
Thinking of doing something with my time instead of always wishing I knew how to play the guitar.
"Try justinguitar.com, the guy is a professional in the way that he structures his lessons and provides practice plans. It has worked for me and is probably the most highly recommended way to learn at least the basics of guitar on r/guitar.However, if you still want real life lessons then more power to you but I have no input in that regard."
Go to the CC
"You can try YouTube for the time being, but don't get sidetracked by other videos lol!"
Thanks but I suck at learning off videos. Rather pay money to have a professional teach me properly.

"yeah alan is a very patient and passionate teacher, you should give him a shot!"

This guy (lecturer) is so cocky. Professionalism and ethics are expected here. You just don’t go and have ‘Korean food and movie’ with your married student.
This kind of behavior isn't accepted pretty much anywhere around the world!

Cold Storage over at Harbourfront center lo
That’s closed too
is both cold storage at vivo and harbourfront closed too?
"Yeah, according to this: https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/no-supermarket-vivocity-several-months-fairprice-xtra-open-q3-2019?fbclid=IwAR1g88PUpt48zYDay_t6eT5A90fHmT6Yn0Tx8xxeihzMRe2ZAgIX1-PgcjASecond paragraph"
No that’s the one right outside giant in vivo. There’s another one at harbourfront centre.
used to come here to buy stuff before gg to sentosa for picnics :'-)
next door still have a small supermarket
You mean Cold storage? Went there yesterday and its as empty as giant.
Won't be surprised if the dairy farm group decided to pull out of the area as a whole.
yes closing confirmed as well
Cold Storage at vivo also closing. They still have a store at Harbourfront.
Cold Storage at Harbourfront center also can
Bye bye Giant. Hello Fairprice. Also Dasio got replaced by a public library.
"Oh! I went to the lib, but I felt something was off, just didn't realised it used to be Daiso."
Many office workers go to the library to sleep during lunch time
I thought you weren't allowed to sleep in the library? I once sat in a chair in the library and closed my eyes for a while and a librarian rudely tapped me on the shoulder to wake me up.
Were u snoring?
"Or, he was also another librarian on duty? :P"
"lol nah, i wasn't even really sleeping. just resting my eyes for awhile."
"Also Dasio got replaced by a public library.I much prefer the Bukit Merah branch but that's the direction NLB is pursuing; building libraries where the crowds are and where it's accessible via public transportation (trains). Sadly, many of the older folks in the Bukit Merah area have lost a great place to read their daily papers, catch up with friends and have access to the internet."
Who would go to vivo city to read books? It feels so out of place

o no where to go gai gai aft work now
Oh no bRo
I wonder what makes fairprice think they can succeed when Giant failed.
"it's backed by ntuc, confirm succeed."
Are they taking very the entire 2 floors or? For giant the ground level should be the one making the loss since most people only go there to get last minute snacks and drinks for sentosa trip.
Loads of people there doing full shops - it was always infested with people on Sunday
I used to buy my groceries from there all the time. Vast spaces to browse. Alas not everything was relevant.
"Because they are ntuc, they are probably rejoicing that their competitor is finally closing more and more shops."

Giant at the first floor stopped operating about 2 months ago. Only their basement floor was still operating till now.
Will miss my memories here
Damn... I will miss this place... Used to come here so many times to go groceries last time... The supermarket ambience was so nice and it was fun shopping there since it was literally a giant superstore and had two big levels selling all kinds of interesting shit from clothes to TVs and consumables... I even remember buying clothes here a few times. Good memories.
Giant doesn't seem to bother with social media nor online service response. Perhaps that's a factor?

"Hey guys, young adult here who needs advice from adult-er adultsI’m planning to sign a hospitalization plan, but I do have a medical condition that if declared, will most probably not be covered by the insurance companyMy doctor told me to not declare to the insurance agent. Not sure if it is the right thing to do?Of course I would rather not declare so I would still get coverage, but I’m not clear on what are the consequences if one day the insurance company finds out?Also the agent im talking to knows I have that condition, but it’s an easy solution. I can just switch to another agent. But I just wanna ask if it is possible for me to just tell him I don’t wish to declare?Any advice would be appreciatedThanks!"
"If they find out you lied, your contract is null and void"
Also tell your doctor don't be a CB.
LOL
entire contract would become void I was told by my agent. I am not sure if it amounts to fraud. perhaps a legal expert could advise?
yes please declare. If you don’t and the insurance company finds out- you can be rest assured that they will- your entire insurance contract is void
"You are still covered under Medishield Life for whatever pre-existing condition you have.Otherwise as what others have mentioned, your policy can get voided by withholding material information."
"Which amazing doctor told you not to declare..?!Anyway, all insurance policies (health, term, disability, etc) are sold in good faith, i.e., that everything material which you know and should know has been declared.Almost all insurance policies correspondingly have a clause stating that breaching good faith renders the policy void. So, declare."
"As others have said here, it would be very unwise to not declare your condition. Exclusions are still covered by Medishield Life.Failing to declare would void your contract, even if you claim for reasons unrelated to your condition and if the insurer finds out (which they always do... they have teams of people who investigate claims especially for large amounts)."
"Whenever there’s a claim (touch wood) relating to your pre existing condition, insurers have the right to check in with your attending doctor to verify if it was possible if you had said condition before the date you were insured.Your attending doc has the responsibility to document it truthfully to the insurer.Your insurer can then reject your claims and refund the premiums to you. Don’t risk it, just declare."
"If you have ever consulted or had treatment at a polyclinic or public hospital for the condition then I would not take a chance on it.It really depends on how serious your condition is and whether you foresee it may cost you a lot of money in future.Another issue is whether the condition makes you uninsurable (eg diabetes) or just counts as a preexisting exclusion. If it's the latter, you can opt for moratorium underwriting (I think only Aviva offers it unless things have changed) where if you don't get treatment for that condition for a period of 5 years from policy start, it will be covered as if it was not diagnosed before the policy started."
"Agent here. Policy will be null and void if they find out. What's your condition if I may ask? If its something minor then just declare would be better, at the end of the day even if you cannot get covered for your preexisting condition at least you can get covered for other potential conditions. The next step would be for the insurer to liase with hospitals for medical records - cannot run de"
"You can hide but not forever. In case when you are hospitalised, the old records can easily be traced and the insurance company will simply deny to pay you. Back to square 1."
Yet another sign that the election will be sooner rather than later.
fear!!!!
I find it funny that somehow everything and anything can be linked to election!!!!
"Singapore's Jan non-oil exports suffer biggest decline in more than 2 yearsSINGAPORE — Singapore's exports stumbled more than expected in January, getting 2019 off to a bumpy start amid signs trade frictions are having an impact on Asia's trade-reliant economies.Weak export data released on Monday (Feb 18) comes two days after Singapore reported the fourth quarter had slowest growth in more than two years and warned of significant moderation for manufacturing this year.""Singapore joins other countries in the region, like Korea, which have been seeing slower export numbers as well,"" Maybank Kim Eng economist Lee Ju Ye said, adding that she expects slower exports this year, particularly in the first quarter.Also on Feb 18, Japan reported that overseas orders for machinery posted their biggest decline in more than a decade in December, and manufacturers expect orders to fall further this quarter as trade friction weighs on global demand.Read alsoEconomists have differing views on MTI’s gloomy economic forecast for 2019Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) fell 10.1 per cent in January from a year earlier, data from the trade agency Enterprise Singapore showedThat was significantly worse than the 1.6 per cent decline predicted by a Reuters poll, a further slowing from December's 8.5 per cent decline and the biggest drop since October 2016.Exports to all Singapore's top trading partners declined in January from the year earlier, including exports to the United States, which fell 4.6 per cent after 15 months of double-digit growth.Shipments to China fell 25.4 per cent in January from the year earlier, after a 15.4 per cent increase in December.On a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, exports contracted 5.7 per cent in January after declining a revised 4.0 per cent in December.

Why do the Eurasians in Singapore always explicitly emphasize that they are Eurasians?
"Because when you talk about capital-E Eurasian they're a specific cultural group whose identity is uniquely rooted in the colonial history of the region and who have dwindled in numbers hugely through emigration or assimilation into the other races. Same reason the Peranakans are always ""IM PERANAKAN YOU KNOW"" except that the Eurasians don't have tons of heritage money being thrown at their culture."
"You might not be able to afford to live here, but you can afford to die,” is a well-known running joke among locals. Here, a low-end car costs around SGD65,000 or $48,000. As for government housing, resale one- and two-room flats start from SGD200,000 or $147,000Implying that we need a car to “live” is just selective journalism"
Maybe easier for people to visualise.
"But still a bad comparison. As a city-state it's been easier for our government to internalise the externalities of car ownership through permits and tolls. This makes cars expensive. Places like New York and London don't exist in a vacuum so it's a lot harder politically to achieve this: why should a person in the suburbs accept quotas or high taxes on their cars for the sake of New York? And if there is no nationwide quota or tax, what's stopping someone from driving their car from elsewhere into New York? The toll booths going into New York can be treated as just a one-time payment, and congestion pricing isn't a thing in the US (though it might be soon). So they don't have the constraints on transport as we do.And yet congestion in New York is estimated to cost about $20 billion a year or about $1500 per commuter. And this only counts for the cost of travel time and lost business; it doesn't include air and noise pollution costs. We have recent research showing that ""doubling the percentage of time spent downwind of a highway increases mortality among individuals 75 and older by 3.6 to 6.8 percent"". The introduction of electronic toll collection ""reduced the incidence of prematurity and low birth weight in the vicinity of toll plazas by 6.7–9.1 percent and 8.5–11.3 percent"" because of lesser congestion and vehicle emissions. These effects don't show up in car prices or any cost-of-living index I can think of."
The joke is can afford to die but cannot afford to get sick right?But yeah just replace car with surgery.
Exactly. I wish reports would take into account how much cheaper food and public transport are here compared to other developed cities instead of using our car and property prices to shock and awe their readers.
Plus most people get a non-trivial subsidy on flats
"In most places a car is vital so I'm willing to give this a pass. Then again, it's Vice so fuck em'."
"Sub par reporting from vice once again. Elderly suicides have actually remained more or less stable over the past few years (126>110>123>129). The increased number (6) is not a statistically significant one. Especially since the total number of elderly is increasing at a much faster rate. In fact, considering all these cherry picked stress inducing factors mentioned by Vice, you would think the suicides across all ages would increase. But actually it decreased by a significant amount 429>361"
"Well if considered the population of elderly increase, the percentage of suicides is actually going down (i guess)"
"Maybe. Although it still doesn’t entirely answer the underlying question which is ‘are the elderly in Singapore living increasingly miserable lives such that they want to kill themselves’. I think for that you will need to look at the total number of suicide attempts or even suicidal ideation among the elderly. For example, even if the elderly wanted to kill themselves many of them might not be able to if they’re in care facilities or are bed bound. You’ll also have to isolate the cause of suicide to only that induced by ‘standards of living’ brought about by institutional factors if you want to make the claim that Vice is making. If the elderly want to kill themselves because they’re more likely to have a debilitating illness since they’re more likely live longer and through what were considered to be devastating medical events, (heart attacks, strokes etc) nothing much we can do about it"
"It's the elderly.Having spoken to many victims’ families, Johari shares that accumulated debt from habitual gambling, medical fees or living expenses are prevalent push factors. Brandishing a constantly changing skyline peppered with skyscrapers of banks and the iconic Marina Bay Sands casino and hotel, “the Switzerland of Asia” is also known to be one of the most expensive and most stressful cities in the world. “You might not be able to afford to live here, but you can afford to die,” is a well-known running joke among locals. "
r/savedyouaclick
"The age group is not that unexpected in the ""first-world"", especially with an aging population and longer life expectancy you expect this to be the case. Hence all the articles these few years about the morality of assisted suicide.Just to clarify, using absolute numbers to say there is an ""all-time high"" should not be the end-all because both the absolute number and proportion of the elderly within our population has increased over the past few years, and we are all living longer. So technically even if the likelihood of a senior citizen committing suicide stayed the same throughout the past decade, we would still observe an increasing proportion of suicides carried out by the elderly. (Of course if the likelihood of a senior citizen committing suicide really did go up, this would worsen).It's the same thing with poverty: we observe more people living under the poverty line because poorer kids aren't dying as much as they used to. But when a baby is born, the chances it will grow up in poverty is lower compared to a few decades ago, whichever poverty line you look at.I am just making a statistical point and this does not mean I think that the suicides aren't a problem. I am really just trying to pre-empt any careless use of the figures. But there is indeed evidence that loneliness and elderly suicides are a rising problem in many rich countries even considering the statistical caveats above.A rough and simple note on the numbers:For example, let's say 10% of old people and 20% of young people commit suicide. If 10 years ago the population was 40 old people and 60 young people, you'd have 4 old people and 12 young people committing suicide. The proportion of the elderly in the total number of suicides is one quarter.If 10 years later you have 60 old people and 40 young people, you'd have 6 old people and 8 young people committing suicide. Nothing has changed to make old people want to kill themselves more, yet every point raised by the article applies:1) The number of elderly committing suicide is at a record high.2) This is even as the number of people committing suicides in other age groups have fallen over the last 10 years.3) The share of elderly suicides has risen from one quarter to about 40%.Note that I haven't even included any total population growth, which would make the number of old people committing suicide even higher."
Vice is desperate for clicks now. We need to let subpar reporting like this die
yeah personally i plan to kill myself when I'm about 60
Who clickbates suicide
vice is not news.... it's tabloid. NEXT!

"While not COE like, there are quotas especially for FW and levies for hiring them"
"Isn't there a COE sort of thing already in place? S-Pass have a levy of SGD 650 per month as well as a quota (10 Singaporeans in a company gets 1 S-Pass). Employment Pass needs a progressively higher salary as per the person's age and experience.As per the latest data out of all Foreigners (Doesn't include PRs) only 11% are EP holders and 12% S Pass holders.Majority of the foreigners are Work Permit holders(Construction workers, cleaners etc.) which stand at 41% of all foreigners.As per the forecast and data by the statistics department of Singapore, in 2030 there will be half of current population in the workforce as the number of people above 65 will double. I guess it's a well known fact that Singapore has the lowest fertility rate in the world ( https://www.statista.com/statistics/268083/countries-with-the-lowest-fertility-rates/ )Source: https://www.population.sg/population-trends/demographics"
"I think the COE system is a far more fair, transparent and accurate system for determining the worth of owning a car than the govt coming up with an arbitrary tax on vehicle ownership. Can't the same be said for immigration?If we accept that there is a problem of overcrowding, we must also accept that there will need to be a reduction in the number of immigrants in all areas of the economy, whether high or low skill. The question is how to decide who gets to stay in the fairest and most efficient way possible.I think an auction based system would be a great way to reduce our overreliance on low skill immigrant labour (work permit holdier like construction/cleaners). By making employers bid for every visa they need, they will be forced to make sure that each worker is absolutely neccessary and a net benefit to the company. Moreover, it would also force them to invest in individual workers through training, better working conditions and better pay as the workers cannot be easily replaced. It would also force us to have a much leaner economy, as the lack of access to unlimited cheap labour incentivises more innovation and productivity growth.I notice you left out the number of dependant passes and long term visit passes which also make up a significant proportion of the foreign population. This would be a fair and transparent way to determine who gets to immigrate on those visas as well."
LTVPs are not allowed to work and the number of Dependent Pass holders(Dependents of EP holders not PRs) is not a significant number and not all of them enter the work force. Are there enough Singaporeans available to take up a job as a construction workers or cleaners? I don't think so.
"I don't think the govt has provided any statistics regarding how many LTVP and dependent passes there actually are. Since the total non-resident population is abt 1.6m, taking away the 1.3m foreigners in the workforce, we're left with about 300k, which I assume is comprised of LTVP and dependants. 300k is a pretty significant number.Ultimately, if we want to increase the non-material standard of living we have to accept that there will have to be some trade offs, in that we will not be able to rely on as many cleaners and construction workers. What an auction system would do would be to eliminate jobs thay are not absolutely neccessary. Some construction tasks for instance, can be replaced by technology and automation. Cleaning jobs, for instance, can be replaced by forcing consumers to clear trash or trays themselves.I think that by shifting away from the use of foreign workers (that are often exploited) for low skill jobs will incentivise innovation and resuscitate our almost 0% productivity growth creating a more dynamic and lean economy in the long run."
"Go to the MOM website there is statistics of how many dependent pass holders enter the work force. I think you lack practicality. You really think you can build skyscrapers with automation alone? Step out on the roads around CBD at 4am someday, you will see how many people clean the streets without anyone noticing, you think that's possible as well without people?"
"Could link the statistics because I cant find anything by googling.I say again, it's not just about jobs. I'm perfectly fine with foreign workers (even their dependents) being in the workforce if we can accomodate them. But the fact of the matter is that many people believe that there are simply not enough resources (space, housing, infrastructure etc.) to go around.It is inevitable then, that there has to be some trade off. If we want to increase our non-material standards of living (not how many jobs are available to us but things like less stress and competition, more space on public transport) , then we might have to live with fewer skyscrapers and less cleaners."
Here is the link: https://www.mom.gov.sg/documents-and-publications/foreign-workforce-numbers
Thanks but there's no info about how many ltvp and dependent passes we issue?
"Jeez man. It clearly states its around 31,000 people which include DP LOC,Training Passes and who entered the work force. If you want an estimate of how many DP holders(Of EP) are there you can do a rough estimation. There are 184,400 EP holders out of which a major share won't be eligible for Dependent Pass(need a minimum 6K salary).For LTVP I already told you it's a non working visa and it's very hard to estimate how many are actually living in Singapore as immediate relatives of PRs (Parents) are issued LTVP and many of them don't live in Singapore."
"Hmmmm looking at the data I'd agree with your point that not many ltvp and dp are in the workforce.Since there's no way to estimate how many ltvp and dp we've issued, it would be pointless to speculate or debate them further. Though I do hope that someone would be able to collect that data in the future, it'd certaintly be helpful to know the figures of how many non-working relatives live here."
"How is it that there are more actual emigrants than people who want to migrate for the former USSR category? Kena forced to migrate?Also, truth is the places most migrants are coming from are not places many seek to migrate to. And a 1-1 policy fairly addresses this issue. Heck. I would have given up my citizenship for a developed country's before NS if I could."
"Forced to migrate, even though they don't really want to, that sounds pretty accurate considering 50-70 years, depending on country, of Soviet rule, propaganda and closed borders. Most of those who really really wanted to leave the former USSR (especially Jews in 70-90s, then others after the collapse) have already left. Others are just old and not motivated enough."
I believe that it can be exploited like the H1B1 visa is in the US.
Care to elaborate?
"Just as for cars, there shd be insurance as well in case the immigrant f****s up."
"We've heard about how Singapore needs immigrants to grow the economy and fill certain gaps in the labour market. On the other hand, it's undeniable that the country is getting more crowded and existing infrastructure can't seem to keep up, leading to quite a bit of unhappiness.Why not try to balance the two, in typical Singaporean fashion, with a market based system like our existing COE for vehicles. Under such a system, the government would set annual quotas for different classes of immigrants (high skill, low skill, dependants, FDW, construction etc.) and auction work visas to employers. This ensures that companies hire immigrants only when they absolutely need to, and that the best candidates that provides the most value is picked. It might also help to incentivise innovation and automation, driving productivity growth as companies are less able to rely on low cost foreign labour. Not to mention generating additional revenue for the government to upgrade infrastructure, invest in other areas or even cut regressive taxes like the GST.Any thoughts?"
"It's hard to make this fair between industries. For the high skill category, for example, the finance companies will snag all the visas while foreign teachers, junior scientists, engineers, experts in arts, social work, public health etc won't be hired.FDW visa auction would be very, very bad. Dual income families largely rely on FDWs to look after children and the elderly. There aren't local equivalents of FDWs that need to be protected, and FDWs are blocked from becoming permanent residents, so why have a quota?"
"For the high skill category, for example, the finance companies will snag all the visas while foreign teachers, junior scientists, engineers, experts in arts, social work, public health etc won't be hired.That's not clear from the outset. The point is that they will have to choose to hire locally or pay the premium to hire a foreign worker. And for high-income jobs you don't see that big wage gap between foreginers and locals as much as you do in blue-collar jobs, so the auction system makes hiring foreigners doubly punitive. And it's probably easier for high-wage industries to find locals to hire than it is for low-wage industries, so the former will be less willing to pay than the latter. So it's actually quite unclear who will end up with the visas. And in any case a lot of the workers you mentioned like teachers, social workers, and healthcare workers have the government as a significant source of demand.The push for immigration controls are mostly political rather than economic (though there are some economic arguments), and I don't see any similar political pressure against FDWs, so I don't think FDW visa auctions are a serious consideration."
"The point is that they will have to choose to hire locally or pay the premium to hire a foreign worker.There comes a point at which it's uneconomical to hire someone. There is not an infinite ceiling to the cost a company is willing to pay for someone. After that the company just chooses to do without (or, depending on the industry, hires someone in a different country instead of in Singapore).it's probably easier for high-wage industries to find locals to hire than it is for low-wage industries, so the former will be less willing to pay than the latter.This is not always true, because high wage more specialized jobs will by definition have fewer people that meet the criteria. Anyone can clear trays but not anyone can have a PhD in biochemistry and have 10 years experience in the field. I think you're looking at it purely in terms of demand by locals for higher salaries rather than capacity of the country to provide locals to companies that have the required qualifications and experience."
I was actually talking more about supply in terms of willingness to do the jobs at the given wages.
"The point of the scheme is to firstly control the number of immigrants and secondly let free market forces determine what kinds of immigrants we need. If there is a high demand for teachers, scientists, engineers etc. then the bids employers will be willing to pay would reflect that and there would result an optimal proportion of each profession within the total max number of immigrants the country decides it can accomodate. Though I do agree that there would need to be more specific categories within the ""high skill"" umbrella.The way I see it, having a FDW is a luxury much like owning a car. If we let the free market decide who gets to have a car, why not FDW? Though I would like to see subsidies for the very old and severely disabled.Ultimately, if we want to reduce the phenomenon of overcrowding, the number of immigrant workers will have to be reduced. I think an auction system is the best and fairest way to decide who should recieve the remaining spaces."
"If you make it too difficult or expensive, the jobs will be outsourced outside. You have to be able to strike a balance. Also an auction system will favor companies with deep pockets and SMEs, startups etc will bite the dust."
"It's not me that wants to make it difficult or expensive.I think there is broad agreement that there is a maximum number of people this island can accomodate. By using that number as a quota and auctioning visas, it is the free market that strikes that balance and determines which jobs we can keep and which can't be sustained.Though I do agree with your point about big corporations."
Singapore has something call income tax and on top of that all kind of levies on foreign workers. There is no need to make up something else that’s going to make the world think we’ve gone bat shit arrogant.
"And a dip in ""Immigration COE"" will incentivise people to immigrate"
"How is it that there are more actual emigrants than people who want to migrate for the former USSR category? Kena forced to migrate?Also, truth is the places most migrants are coming from are not places many seek to migrate to. And a 1-1 policy fairly addresses this issue. Heck. I would have given up my citizenship for a developed country's before NS if I could."
"In Singapore, in order to own a car, there is the principle of the Certificate of Entitlement (COE). The COE licenses are auctioned regularly and grant the winning bidders ownership of a car for 10 years (1 time renewal possible). This was instated to limit the number of private cars effectively to ~600.000 (Singapore population ~5.6 million). This is to combat traffic congestion and to further the governments goal to go “car-lite”. While there is many other problems with this approach as well, a big problem resulting from this is that mostly those who can afford it will drive, even when it is not necessary, while others are often struggling with long commutes. Often, wealthy car owners will drive to work (alone), even though it might be a 15min bus ride away, while a working class family with two kids struggles to bring their kids to school, get groceries and other relevant activities of daily life.Currently, the cars follow an auction principle. This results in the same number of cars (since the number of cars is fixed by the government, yet naturally results in a shift of car ownership to higher income classes, as those are able to spend a greater amount of money on a privilege like a car.However, cars do have their place in the city, yet only for those who most need it. Thus I propose a “need-based” system for assigning a fixed number of cars to citizens/households. The factors taken into account for this are (in no particular order):Distance from workplaceConnectivity at place of residence/work placeAgeMarital statusChildrenDistance from schoolsThe government has all of this data already for all citizens. All applications are ranked by in order of priority (factors are weighed) and the top ~600.000 priorities of households get assigned a car. In order to reduce the number of non-serious applications, there should be an application fee. In order to prevent the application fee from deterring low-income citizens from applying, the application fee is a relative fee, based on monthly household income, taking into consideration basic needs such as food and electricity.Some examples:A family with 2 kids has a monthly household income of SGD5,000.After subtracting their food and electricity requirements (SGD250/person/month), their fee for a car application is $5,000-(4x$250) = $4,000.They stay a combined 28km from their workplaces.This household is high priority for car ownership.A single staying in their own house has a monthly household income of SDG12,000.After subtracting their food and electricity requirements their fee for a car application is $12,000-(1x$250) = $11,750.They stay a combined 8km from their workplaces.This household is low priority for car ownership.The added benefit would be a higher vehicle occupancy as well, since more families would drive the car, rather than singles. Also, since more people with lower incomes would drive, they would have an incentive to use GrabHitch (a service that allows you to monetise your commute), as the small amounts of money associated with that would mean more to them rather than to wealthier citizens, who might not rely on a few dollars saved per commute.I'm curious to hear feedback and suggestions to this proposal! This is not a perfect approach, and I'm a looking forward to hear other potential approaches as well as suggestions for improvement!Stats [Singapore]:Average trip distance ~9kmAverage vehicle occupancy 1.7 pax/car"
"Market mechanisms (which include our current COE quota system) generally work. If you want to replace it with something else, you have to explain (a) why the current mechanism doesn't work; and (b) why your replacement is better.Here are a few problems with your proposal.Your distance-from-work criterionThis criterion incentivises people to take jobs far away from their homes so as to get subsidies for buying a car. It also contributes even more to congestion since these folks will drive even more.Economists regard the notion of ""needs"" as largely meaningless rhetoric. Does the family in your first example ""need"" to stay a combined 28km from their workplaces? Or could they have chosen a job closer to home (or a home closer to their job)?Often, wealthy car owners will drive to work (alone)You are correct about this problem. Which is why the government has been moving away from ownership-based fees (i.e. COE etc.) towards usage and congestion-based fees.The latter is the correct solution to the problem of congestion. Making it cheaper for ""needier"" families to own cars is not.Government revenue.In FY2017, Vehicle Quota Premiums (i.e. COE) and Motor Vehicle Taxes made up 8.0% + 3.1% = 11.1% of total government revenue. These taxes are paid by those who are rich enough to own cars.Under your system, these revenues would go down dramatically and would have to be replaced by some other tax that would probably make the tax system less progressive.In general, if for whatever reason an individual or family is deemed ""needy"" or ""deserving"", the best way to help them is through direct transfers. Not some arbitrary and distortionary mechanism (like ""make cars cheaper for them!"")"
"What do you think of scaling COE prices based on the number of cars a household have? This would increase COE revenue and at the same time allow more lower income households to own minimally one car and capitalise on higher income households for owning multiple cars.For example, a second COE will cost 10% more and a third COE will cost 30% more and so on. This would primarily target households where the husband, wife, and children all got a car of their own."
Why should each lower income family having a car be a policy objective? Singapore is perhaps the last place on earth that car ownership is something that should be evenly distributed.

"scaling COE prices based on the number of cars a household have?This would be distortionary.First, it would penalise large households simply for being large.Second, the foremost negative externality (for which the COE is an imperfect remedy) is congestion. A rich household with numerous cars but which leaves these cars idling in the garage contributes relatively little to congestion. If anything, they should actually pay less since each of the cars they own contributes less to congestion than the average car.Again, if we deem lower-income households needy, the best way to help them is through direct transfers. Not make cars cheaper for them."
"This is definitely a good idea! Having multiple cars per households deprives many others of the opportunity to own any car at all, at a very small benefit to the household with multiple cars.This scaling model seems very reasonable!"
"Market mechanisms (which include our current COE quota system) generally work.I agree with that. Generally, I believe in the workings of those kind of systems; however, through several observations I made (now this is anecdotal evidence, thus admittedly weak), I thought of several things as to...(a) why the current mechanism doesn't work.The high number of single occupancy vehicles. In a country that is ""land-scarce"", it is questionable what the societal benefit is from an average 1.7pax taking up 8-10m^2 of road space, when our public transport network is extensive and (overall) reliable.Wealthy families with ""collections"" of cars, withholding them from others who have greater use for them. It is not uncommon to see more than one car parked in front of landed properties, oftentimes with a variety of high-end cars, some of which are truly impracticable and thus probably driven only for fun (i.e. Ferraris).People commuting short distances by car, despite having direct and easy connections to their work place (sometimes even within walkable distance).All of those observations make me question the validity of a system that prioritises those that have more money for easy transport in a city. There is the concept of transport poverty.This criterion incentivises people to take jobs far away from their homes so as to get subsidies for buying a car.There probably is a risk of people trying to game the system. However, I am not so sure how much people are willing to compromise on their home location/work place just for getting a car. After all, your home is a life purchase, whereas your COE would last only for 10 years. In the system I propose, a car will by no means be cheap, and will still be a purchase that warrants very careful consideration.Or could they have chosen a job closer to home (or a home closer to their job)?This assumes that people have virtually unlimited freedom in choosing their job/home location. However, in a country with >90% home-ownership rate, your home location is pretty much fixed for significant parts of your live, as many people will at most own flats in 2 different places over their entire life. They could choose a job that is closer to their home, however, this is challenging both for people from high- and low-income backgrounds: people from high-income background might have specific criteria of companies they want to work with, to maximise their development or opportunity. Companies don't have an unlimited amount of headquarters in our nation, so they are likely fixed within certain areas. For low-income, there is often a limit due to their skillsets and other considerations, as they have less privilege in choosing the company they want to work for. This deprives them of the opportunity to choose different jobs that are more beneficial.Which is why the government has been moving away from ownership-based fees (i.e. COE etc.) towards usage and congestion-based fees.Not sure how much the $1-2 will deter someone driving a 7-series from entering a congested zone. Congestion pricing works much better for those who are of lower income, as they will tend to drive out of necessity, rather than comfort. $1-2 per trip could actually deter them. However, someone who was able to spend tens of thousands of dollars on their COE is unlikely to be deterred.Also, at what price point will someone who owns a car consider taking the bus/MRT rather than to drive? Those that I know who drive will drive regardless. If they want to avoid congestion, they will not consider taking the bus/MRT, but rather, they will adjust their timing for driving, thus keeping overall car usage high. This is a mindset change that is required.Look at Orchard Road on a Saturday. Frankly, few people will have to drive to work to Orchard Road on a Saturday and thus are driving only for leisure. Thus, time is less of a factor and taking the bus/train instead of driving would be a viable option for them and yet, the road is choked up most days.Under your system, these revenues would go down dramatically and would have to be replaced by some other tax that would probably make the tax system less progressive.Good point. In the long-term, the goal should be to reduce car ridership nationwide. This is why I proposed a need-based system, as currently, those who want to drive (and can afford it) are allowed to drive, rather than those who arguably would benefit the most from it. If we can lower the percentage of cars trips that are replaceable by other means, this will allow us to reduce space used for roads and reassign them for other uses. Currently, roads use up 12% of our land area. If we can reduce this even by a small amount, there is significant land area available to be repurposed, which could be an alternative source of income for the government."
"2) Wealthy families with ""collections"" of cars, withholding them from others who have greater use for them. It is not uncommon to see more than one car parked in front of landed properties, oftentimes with a variety of high-end cars, some of which are truly impracticable and thus probably driven only for fun (i.e. Ferraris).The problem the COE seeks to combat is congestion. By leaving their cars unused but nonetheless paying the COE, these rich people are actually donating money to the rest of society which is great.3) People commuting short distances by car, despite having direct and easy connections to their work place (sometimes even within walkable distance).If a driver has paid her COE and has to pay ERP for her ""short distance"" to work, then she has probably paid any external costs she inflicts on the rest of society during her trip.But if she hasn't (as you seem to believe), then the solution is not to make cars cheaper for ""needy"" families (this solves nothing), but to increase the COE and ERP and make her fully bear the cost of her trip.This assumes that people have virtually unlimited freedom in choosing their job/home location.I have not assumed that people have the ""unlimited freedom"" to do anything. Such all-or-nothing thinking is exactly what economics cautions against.People weigh a wide variety of costs and benefits before doing anything. When choosing a job, the length of the commute is one among many factors. Whether there is your ""distance-to-work"" car subsidy is another -- and if such a subsidy exists, it would encourage even more driving and congestion.For low-income, there is often a limit due to their skillsets and other considerations, as they have less privilege in choosing the company they want to work for. This deprives them of the opportunity to choose different jobs that are more beneficial.Even if this is a legitimate factor, the best solution is not to make cars cheaper for them, but to give them a direct transfer.Not sure how much the $1-2 will deter someone driving a 7-series from entering a congested zone.Again, all-or-nothing thinking. Here your mistake is to think that the $1-2 ERP charge either works for everyone or it works for no one.ERP charges may not influence the choices of a billionaire Ferrari driver, but it does influence the choices of many other drivers. And this is good enough for the purpose such charges serve, which is to reduce congestion.Those that I know who drive will drive regardless.Again, all-or-nothing thinking. Maybe ""those that [you] know"" are all billionaires who don't care at all about ERP charges. But believe it or not, there do exist drivers who take ERP charges into consideration.While we're giving anecdotes, I'll give one of myself. I do not own a car, but even when I take Go-Jek/Grab, I ask the driver to avoid any ERP charges. (So too did a passenger in a recent viral video.)"
"By leaving their cars unused but nonetheless paying the COE, these rich people are actually donating money to the rest of society which is great.Fair point!But if she hasn't (as you seem to believe), then the solution is not to make cars cheaper for ""needy"" families (this solves nothing), but to increase the COE and ERP and make her fully bear the cost of her trip.I do indeed assume that not all externalities are accounted for. I'm not sure how much cost can help here, that's why I proposed a different model (which has its own shortcomings).Whether there is your ""distance-to-work"" car subsidy is another -- and if such a subsidy exists, it would encourage even more driving and congestion.It's not really a subsidy, as drivers will still need to pay for their trip. I am not suggesting to get rid of ERP and other current measures, if anything, the usage of cars should become even more expensive (the usage, not the ownership though). The system would allow those who have further to drive to have higher priority in getting assigned a car, since they stand to benefit from shorter commutes.Also, you seem to assume that owning a car in itself is something desirable. People would want to try and get a car, even when they have to commute longer distances. However, why would someone who currently has a 30min MRT commute change to a job that is significantly further away in the hopes of achieving a 30min car commute? This only makes sense if we assume that people want to drive, even if they do not save time.In Singapore, there is a strong association of cars with status. Perhaps this is the first thing we should tackle before all else.If owning a car seems to be worth changing your workplace to a more distant location, maybe it's the perception of cars that needs to be changed, not the car pricing.Even if this is a legitimate factor, the best solution is not to make cars cheaper for them, but to give them a direct transfer.Fair point!ERP charges may not influence the choices of a billionaire Ferrari driver, but it does influence the choices of many other drivers. And this is good enough for the purpose such charges serve, which is to reduce congestion.Fair point!But believe it or not, there do exist drivers who take ERP charges into consideration.Fair enough. I have yet to meet one!While we're giving anecdotes, I'll give one of myself. I do not own a car, but even when I take Go-Jek/Grab, I ask the driver to avoid any ERP charges.Good point. I hardly ever take Grab/Go-Jek, so I have little experiences with that."
"It's not really a subsidyIf two individuals A and B purchase the same good but A pays less, then A is receiving a subsidy. (Or equivalently, B is paying an additional tax. A subsidy is simply a negative tax.)Here you have suggested that people who live further away from work pay less for a car -- this is a subsidy.you seem to assume that owning a car in itself is something desirableI do not. Which is why I support the COE and congestion charges.You are the one who makes this assumption, because you propose a system that makes it cheaper and easier for ""needy"" families to own cars."
"The compromise people make in choosing to live closer to work can be seen through the price premium of homes that are conveniently placed. Most obviously homes closer to central or more expensive, homes 5 min walk versus 10 min or 15 min to MRT stations for example.Having a long commute to work or anywhere else on the island is not a large social ill and neither is transportation poverty. A car allocation scheme is so heavy handed when one can simply take a bus or call a cab/grab. It's hard to argue for such legislation when it is a luxury. We have controls on food prices, public transport and utilities, compulsory education and healthcare schemes, if poverty leads to a lack of any of these things it would make for really wretched living. Living without a car is no big deal.More perversely, most bungalows and big landed houses are in estates with poor transport links. They may get the car quotas when based on travel distance and if they don't, what are they going to do under this scheme? It would also not be fair to take away cars away from these people. Based on bus routes and MRT, people who live deep in landed neighbourhoods actually 'need' cars and in fact, under the COE system, they do pay and generate tax revenue."
"There are two ways to price private transportation: ownership costs and usage costs. Ownership costs here are those of the COE license, but also the fixed cost of the car + taxes. Usage costs are parking costs, ERPs, fuel and more intangible costs such as “level of congestion” or “availability of parking”.Where Singapore fails for me is to have upped the ownership costs while letting the usage costs relatively low. I mean hell, every new building still comes with several floors dedicated to parking, roads make up 12% of land (with 4 extra percent for parking lots), fuel is not as high as in many other cities and the ERP is also comparatively low.High ownership costs but low usage costs do incentivise the “sunk cost” attitude of using the car at any moment if you happen to own one. They also create strong political disincentives to curb the space used by the cars to build eg cycling lanes where road lanes used to be, because drivers feel cheated (rightfully or not) of the high premium they paid to drive. Finally, they can also incentivise a class of people to own/rent a car with the sole goal of making a return on their investment, by eg becoming a ride share driver.All in all it is unclear that high ownership costs reduce much private transportation use. Let’s not forget the Vehicle Quota System effectively bounds the demand already so the real battle is to make current owners of private vehicles use their cars less.To come back to the topic, a needs-based approach sounds awfully centralised. Determining need is not as easy as statistical aggregation and as others have pointed out, the policy goal should not be to make it easier to access a private transport, but for public transportation and alternative modes to be more attractive. It is not clear that once you are determined to be “in need” of a car, you won’t use the car for x and y purposes as is the case now of “sunk cost” attitude. The needs-based approach also creates the same locked-in dependency to the car: would you want to be the politician who removes the right of “those in need” to access their private transportation? Our market mechanisms are not perfect and certainly need some tuning, along with planning policy for roads and parking, but the needs-based approach does not seem to answer these problems in a satisfying way."
"Great comment, fully agree!High ownership costs but low usage costs do incentivise the “sunk cost” attitude of using the car at any moment if you happen to own one.This presents a great opportunity to increase the usage cost of a car - not just in the monetary sense, but also in aspects of time and convenience. If we reduce (surface) parking, allocate more space to bus-only lanes/cycling lanes/sidewalks and implement traffic calming measures, the ""cost"" of driving (in terms of time & convenience) increases, while the non-monetary ""cost"" of other modes decreases. I think this is commonly found in European cities: car ownership rates are high, but expensive (underground) parking, narrow roads and pedestrian-only zones increase the ""convenience-cost"" of driving while the saved space is reallocated to trams & bike lanes, providing viable and convenient alternatives. Unless you really need to drive (i.e. buy lots of groceries, ferry your elderly parents etc.), people might not choose to drive, despite owning a car.(with 4 extra percent for parking lots)I had no idea is was this much for parking! :ODetermining need is not as easy as statistical aggregationI did gloss over part in my suggestion. But it would definitely be incredibly difficult to determine the need, and whatever the outcome, you would be sure to upset all those who were not determined ""needy"".locked-in dependency to the carDefinitely true.After reading all the comments, I have realised a lot more shortcomings of this proposed system - which is what I was aiming for.Ultimately, I think we need to find a way to reduce modal share of cars significantly. Part of this is increasing the number of drivers who have attitudes as some commenters here - they own a car, but will decide for each trip based on usefulness whether to drive or take public transport."
"Let me say first that it is great to have someone like you talk about these issues with an out of the box proposition that is not obvious and you are willing to argue and ask questions! Transportation is a polarising topic (when it should be much less, honestly) but it’s refreshing to discuss when the other party asks genuine questions with well-thought out replies.The european cities have had to make these choices also due to their long heritage. The last time Paris was seriously rehauled in terms of planning dates from the 19th century and Haussmann’s renovations. Still some cities there are highly congested, like Rome or Athens to take only two examples (Paris is not much better but at least willing to try and reduce the physical space for private transportstion). But you are right, consciously or not they all in a way raised usage costs (and you would be hard-pressed to call driving “convenient” in any of them)."
"I hate your idea, hear me out. The VQS and COE is implemented to reduce congestion by reducing the number of cars on the road. But your entire idea contradicts that. Look at it this way, I am very much a supporter of rich people buying 4 or 5 cars to park at home. Why? Because they pay COE, which is a boon for me, and they cant drive 2 cars at one time so they cant congest the road more. So any additional car that a single wealthy person buys is an upshot for the rest of us because he has to pay additional taxes yet does not congest the road.Now imagine we have your idea implemented. What does that mean? Well it would mean that those who are likely to use cars more often will get to while those who are more likely to park their extra car in the garage wont get to. Meaning that, while we may have the same number of COEs issued, the congestion would certainly increase because you've now allocated cars to those who will use them more. Worse still, our revenue from COE will be less because you've decided to give subsidies to those who need the car.So what are the results of your policy? It would seem that, keeping the number of COEs issued constant, we would have (a) less revenue from COE due to subsidies and (b) more road congestion. What are your plans to recover the lost revenue? What are your plans to reduce congestion? (Well, here is one plan, we can reduce the overall number of COEs to lower congestion, but that would reduce your COE revenue even further and would mean that the subsidies you are giving out are larger.)Let's also not ignore the fact that such a policy basically gives middle-income earners a subsidy to own cars. Why should we do that when we could be helping the extremely poor instead?If your concern is about giving middle-income earners a means of transportation, then an easier plan is to keep the market system as it is, but channel the revenue towards (a) more efficient public transport or (b) vouchers for taxi rides for those who need but cannot afford a car."
Thanks for the feedback! Especially the point about multiple parked cars at home actually makes a lot of sense.
"I am going to say this and people may downvote me, but with the extensive public transportation network, taxis and PHVs, most people don't really need a car in Singapore.Those who have it (like me), pay for the convenience and not because we need it.Edit: Also I do not think it should be the priority of any Singapore government to make cars affordable for low-income families."
"Great point!I am curious to know what would make you consider taking the bus/train for a specific trip rather than driving?I guess that if we can increase the convenience of taking public transit sufficiently, more people might consider not driving (at least for some of their trips).“A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. It's where the richuse public transportation.”Enrique Peñalosa"
"Incidently, I work at an environment where my superiors jet around in business, yet do not own a car. They are ang moh - in their home countries, not owning a car is unthinkable.When queried on (their lack of) car ownership - they simply say that it doesn't make any sense to buy a car as public transportation is so good and readily available. They have young kids too."
"I think it's a common thought among ang mohs living in cities. Especially the younger generation seems to consider car ownership more of a burden rather than a privilege.This of course goes hand in hand with many European (and some American) cities prioritising public transit/walking/biking developments over building of road & parking facilities for private cars. From my (and m friends') experiences in New York, Munich and Berlin, taking the car (considering the time needed for parking etc.) can actually take around the same time as taking the bike/public transit, at least during peak. So convenience is kinda ""redistributed"" such that choosing your transport mode is dependent on other factors, rather than time."
When I know parking is going to be a bitch and expensive.
Thanks for sharing!
I saw this post on /r/transit and the first thing I thought was whether OP even lives here in the first place.
"There's two issues with your proposalHow do you determine when someone ""needs"" a carThe actual question to ask is not whether someone ""needs"" a car but whether someone can access transportation easily regardless of social strata, income or level of disabilityPoint 1 is hard to answer because strictly speaking, cars are mode of transportation and hence a surrogate measure for transport efficacy.Point 2 is more important to answer because doing so allows you to assess if our transport system is robust, cheap, reliable, etc. Delving deeper into Point 2 means that you might find it is more equitable to give, say, taxi vouchers to ""needy"" families rather than expect them to own a cheap car that comes with externalities (such as maintenance costs and accidents - which can cost a lot). Those externalities don't need to be paid for if you take a taxi for example."
"Great thoughts! Fully agree with both points.I mentioned it in another comment as well, saying that it would be incredibly difficult, and the decision makers would upset all those who were not considered ""needy"". And when does anyone really ""need"" a car, unless living in the countryside (or L.A.)? So definitely agree with that.Yes, very well put! Ultimately, my biggest interest is to find ways to improve transport and mobility, by whatever means.transport efficacyHave not yet heard of that term, I'll check it out!it is more equitable to give, say, taxi vouchers to ""needy"" familiesGreat suggestion!"
This is one way to lose votes.
"This is unnecessarily convoluted. If, from your example, family A has more to gain from car ownership, they will pay the COE to reclaim the opportunity cost on their time. Why force the state to have an opportunity cost model when market participants can run their own models and make individual decisions.A side effect too is that you will end up with a very hard to police leasing market. Anyone who is an outlier on the state's model will purchase to sublease."
"It's an interesting idea, but as someone that does drive in Singapore the guiding principle must be there are already too many cars on the roads. Even with the COE, during peak hours the roads are way too congested, and seem to be getting much worse (especially in the Central area).I think the government is doing a good job in moving to a ""car light"" society, with new rail lines and bus services, so people at least have the option of using public transport. As you mentioned there are people with cars that will drive anywhere regardless, and it will take time to shift to a mindset where people would consider using public transport for certain trips instead. The idea is that as people get more use to this behaviour, they may consider giving up their COE's entirely, hopefully leading to less demand and where a family with a greater ""need"" for a car can go ahead and buy one. In fact, over the last couple of years the COE rates have already significantly, so it could be argued the policy is already paying dividendsFor the record, where we live in Singapore has one existing MRT line, plus about four years ago a new line (Downtown) opened, a new (Thompson) line is now under construction nearby, and they are about to start tunnelling the North South Road Corridor."
"I think the next-gen satellite ERP will make COE more or less obsolete for congestion control anyway. Taxing for the marginal cost of congestion makes much more sense than an ownership tax, which encourages individuals to drive the heck out of their vehicles to break even on their investment."
"As someone who drives, what would make you consider to take the bus/MRT for a specific trip (not giving up your car entirely)?I think it's important to understand why people prefer driving, if we truly want to achieve a better transport system within the country."
"I’m really indifferent to whether I drive, or take public transport instead. It does help that there are a lot of very good public transport options nearby.If I’m working in the CBD, I’ll take the train every time. Likewise if we’re heading to Orchard on the weekend, we will just take the train.On days I’m working at Changi, I’m more likely to drive, because even the fastest route by public transport is over an hour.We really only have a car because we have young children, so on weekends it opens up a lot more options for places we can go.I do agree the mentality of some drivers remains to take the car everywhere. Anyone can see it with the queues around Orchard Turn, or malls like Thompson Plaza every weekend."
"Interesting perspective! Great to hear a very reasonable approach to using the car. I think having children is really a big factor for what would make a car viable. My friends who struggle the most from not having a car are those with young children. For myself being single, I don't mind taking public transport."
"We’d never even considered getting a car until we had children. All in it’s probably costs around $1k or more per month, which we could do without as we used to get by with public transport during the week and the odd taxi over the weekend"
"Driving is chosen when:Need to take small kids or elderlyJourney by public transport takes too long compared to drivingJourney requires too many transfers, especially if it’s train->bus. Or worse, bus->train->busNeed to haul bulky or heavy stuff e.g. grocery shoppingI need to look good. Must wear fancy clothing (and uncomfortable shoes) and cannot be sweaty.Outside of public transport operating hoursPublic transport is preferred when:Traffic jams make the MRT as fast or faster than driving.I’m not in a rush and would enjoy being able to read/play/relax on my phone.Parking would be hard to find or exorbitant"
Thanks for sharing!
Literally all your reasons are solved by grab or taxi.
"As someone who drives, what would make you consider to take the bus/MRT for a specific trip (not giving up your car entirely)?That was the question. Not why I wouldn't get rid of my car. Obviously if I didn't have a car, Grab or taxi would be the replacement for driving.But a very important point is that Grab/taxi doesn't solve all the above. When you have kids between the ages of 1 to about 5, Grab/taxi doesn't work well because the kids require car seats or booster seats. Infants you can carry around in a basket-like infant car seat that may attach to a stroller. But the toddler car seat and the booster seats are quite bulky to carry around. Grab is subject to the same car seat laws as the general public, so until the kid is 1.35 m tall (about age 8), the driver should reject you if you don't bring the booster seat. Taxi is exempt, but obviously the safety issue is still there. You can kind of put the adult seat belt on a kid who's 5 and up (still doesn't fit right) but below that, the kid will go flying if the taxi crashes."
Yes your point is valid. Not ez for young kids due to booster seat requirement. I would keep these at home but I don’t have kids much to the gahmen’s dismay.
"I think everywhere has mentioned the main reasons of time savings, late nights, kids. I think no one has mentioned its use as a portable locker.I used to jam and gig a fair bit. Before I was of driving age, I had to bring my instruments around by public transport and taxi. This means lugging the instrument around all day if you don't intend to return home. After getting my license and car, it became much simpler, since you can just dump it in the boot."
"In Singapore, in order to own a car, there is the principle of the Certificate of Entitlement (COE). The COE licenses are auctioned regularly and grant the winning bidders ownership of a car for 10 years (1 time renewal possible). This was instated to limit the number of private cars effectively to ~600.000 (Singapore population ~5.6 million). This is to combat traffic congestion and to further the governments goal to go “car-lite”. While there is many other problems with this approach as well, a big problem resulting from this is that mostly those who can afford it will drive, even when it is not necessary, while others are often struggling with long commutes. Often, wealthy car owners will drive to work (alone), even though it might be a 15min bus ride away, while a working class family with two kids struggles to bring their kids to school, get groceries and other relevant activities of daily life.Currently, the cars follow an auction principle. This results in the same number of cars (since the number of cars is fixed by the government, yet naturally results in a shift of car ownership to higher income classes, as those are able to spend a greater amount of money on a privilege like a car.However, cars do have their place in the city, yet only for those who most need it. Thus I propose a “need-based” system for assigning a fixed number of cars to citizens/households. The factors taken into account for this are (in no particular order):Distance from workplaceConnectivity at place of residence/work placeAgeMarital statusChildrenDistance from schoolsThe government has all of this data already for all citizens. All applications are ranked by in order of priority (factors are weighed) and the top ~600.000 priorities of households get assigned a car. In order to reduce the number of non-serious applications, there should be an application fee. In order to prevent the application fee from deterring low-income citizens from applying, the application fee is a relative fee, based on monthly household income, taking into consideration basic needs such as food and electricity.Some examples:A family with 2 kids has a monthly household income of SGD5,000.After subtracting their food and electricity requirements (SGD250/person/month), their fee for a car application is $5,000-(4x$250) = $4,000.They stay a combined 28km from their workplaces.This household is high priority for car ownership.A single staying in their own house has a monthly household income of SDG12,000.After subtracting their food and electricity requirements their fee for a car application is $12,000-(1x$250) = $11,750.They stay a combined 8km from their workplaces.This household is low priority for car ownership.The added benefit would be a higher vehicle occupancy as well, since more families would drive the car, rather than singles. Also, since more people with lower incomes would drive, they would have an incentive to use GrabHitch (a service that allows you to monetise your commute), as the small amounts of money associated with that would mean more to them rather than to wealthier citizens, who might not rely on a few dollars saved per commute.I'm curious to hear feedback and suggestions to this proposal! This is not a perfect approach, and I'm a looking forward to hear other potential approaches as well as suggestions for improvement!Stats [Singapore]:Average trip distance ~9kmAverage vehicle occupancy 1.7 pax/car"
"Just curious if this is an assignment or proposal for submission. ;DI contend that the need to own cars in Singapore is driven by several key factors:Need to get to places (Commonly for work).Privacy during transportation.Ownership of vehicle based on ""want"" rather than ""need"".The larger issue stems from the need to ""work to survive"". If Singapore (and the world) society transits to a flexible work arrangement where one could work from anywhere (including one's home) and hold e-meetings effectively, we'd cut down on the need to travel, loosely followed by fewer cars on the road, and the easing of roads.Drivers would agree that peak hours are ""peak"" because everyone is going to and leaving work around the same time. In threads some time ago, I assert that you could drive around Singapore and not experience congestion at times such at 3.30pm ~ 4.30pm, or even after 11.30pm.Fancy a round-island highway trip? Pick your poison from any of the highways from 2am and monopolize the first lane for all we care.Of course, this is predicated on the very notion of ""work"" itself. That we equate labor to income in exchange for necessities, but it's a whole other complex issue.Seems you're gunning for a quantified approach towards car ownership. I'd like to add that, ideally, anyone who wishes to own a car, ought to be able to exercise their right to purchase the car. The current COE implementation merely serves as a small road block towards car ownership. Hence, you are right that people with higher income are in a better position to secure a car.Quantifying the ability to own the car and tying it into earning and distance values could be viable, but I only see it as a slippery slope towards edging others away from car ownership. Perhaps we could factor in users who need a vehicle to ferry their ageing parents and grandparents with mobility issues? That includes caretakers and transportation companies too, especially if they serve a userbase who could really need private transportation."
"Just curious if this is an assignment or proposal for submission. ;DNeither actually haha! This idea came to me during lunch so I wanted to write out the details of the idea and hear others' opinions on it.Of course, this is predicated on the very notion of ""work"" itself. That we equate labor to income in exchange for necessities, but it's a whole other complex issue.Interesting point on the notion of work!Perhaps we could factor in users who need a vehicle to ferry their ageing parents and grandparents with mobility issues?Yes! I would definitely consider this a category who ""needs"" a vehicle. Thus, it could function similar to the Proximity Housing Grant.Although perhaps need is the wrong word altogether in this context. After all, our public transport system is overall really extensive and reliable."
"This is going to be based on anecdotal evidence (I've spent a week in Singapore on business once), but based on my experience I would contend that if there is a place in the world where owning a personal car should be solidly considered a luxury, it's going to be Singapore - the transit network there is reliable, extensive and comfortable enough to not necessitate car journeys.This is why I really like the exorbitant COE costs and I'd create even more demand by cutting down on the amount issued - the fees generate revenue that can be funnelled back into further improving the transit system and subsidising/supporting PHVs in cases of genuine need.Then again I'm of the opinion that the current concept of personal ownership of cars is outdated in any large urban environment - having a car that sits idly in a parking lot/yard for 20hrs a day is foolish from an environmental and economic as well as from a congestion perspective - effective transit coupled with large PHV/ridesharing networks is the answer."
"My question would be why? If the public transit system is good enough for everyone to use, then why bother making these efforts to get car ownership for poorer people. Possibly invest in better taxi service for people who need cars occasionally but otherwise the government should be working towards little to no private car ownership altogether to be environmental friendly and reduce congestion for things that need to use roads (like transport trucks)."
the government should be working towards little to no private car ownership altogetherFully agree with this!
"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:[/r/singapore] A need-based system for assigning cars in cities [Singapore] If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads. (Info / ^Contact)"
"I worry that this sort of system would produce some significant perverse incentives - someone who just barely misses the cutoff for a car permit would move slightly farther from work or to a slightly more awkward location in order to qualify for a car. Some of the relevant measures of need seem useful. But home location seems like a bad one to use, unless the number of homes in the locations that get any priority are strictly capped."
"I definitely agree that there is a risk of perverse incentives, and people trying to game the system.Specifically for homes, I'm not sure how applicable that would be though, since home ownership rate is incredibly high in Singapore (>90%), making moving quite difficult. But I see how people might find all kinds of way around that too."
Do you work for Grab?
Haha no :D Although that would be a great strategy
Yeah it would be. What I don't get is why a lower income family is more suited to having a car than just having better and or cheaper bus or train service? Owning a car even without Singapore's car taxes is pretty expensive. Public transport is safer and let's parents focus on kids instead of driving. It also gives kids more independence at a younger age.
"Totally agree! Ultimately, I think we should focus on providing great non-car options (public transit + walking + bike/PMD) rather than becoming car dependent. I personally like taking the train the most of all modes of transport (except maybe cycling), because it's so little hassle (compared to driving) and gives you the time to read or sleep."
"Agree though I prefer the bus because the seats are more comfortable and you don't need to go three or more levels down. I concede they are slower, less frequent and less smooth, but you do get a view in exchange."
I actually prefer buses but I tend to get motion sickness unfortunately...

Singapore youtubers and funny don't go together
"Am I the only one who finds Dee Kosh rude? His jokes are often crude and offensive, or maybe im the only one who feels that way?If you're a comedian, your jokes do not need to inflict harm imo."
Hes not even funny he just yells at people. And now that he has some following he feels untouchable
"Eh offensive jokes are funny. Comedians like Bill Burr often use offensive jokes. I find them funny. Even racist/misogynistic/homophobic are funny, in the right setting. They're jokes. This makes people find racism, misogyny and homophobia funny because of how ridiculous those views are."
"There is a difference between good offensive jokes and bad offensive jokes though. I'm not sure about Dee Kosh (never watched his videos), but a guy like SovietWomble (not SG, but can we claim Cyanide?) can make genocide funny."
"""claim"" cyanide haha. He's already a national treasure"
how are they offensive? smh
"Because their over-the-top representation of the local minah/makcik subculture appeals to many of the locals, seeing that these videos are the more popular ones on their channel. Personally these types of videos are not my taste but i can get why people enjoy them.Hirzi is also openly pro-LGBT and one of the first Malay ambassadors for LGBT in Singapore so it's no surprise he often plays drag!"
Since the 90s there were actors dressing up as females on Channel 8. Remember Liang Po Po? Folks here find it funny I guess.
Because both Dee Kosh and Hizri are bitchy AF and their warped minds only think it's okay to be so bitchy if they resemble a woman.If you want an actual funny female go look up prettipls
"Yeah I really like her, the new e8 song is funny"
Seconded
It's easier than actually being funny.
Cuz aunties are funny ppl
Clearly you've never heard of Monty Python then. They had a scene with men cross dressing as women cross dressing as men in a movie. I believe it was the stoning scene.
Maybe they got their inspiration from Kumar.That guy is da bomb!
"We don't have funny females on SG YouTube.Also, there's nothing wrong with drag being popular, in fact I find it quite entertaining and would love to watch more of it in the SG scene."
It actually just looks like Dee Kosh likes dressing in drag.
They hoping to make / re-create another Jack neo's iconic liang por por?
We have guys playing grandma on philippine tv as well...
why are you actively tracking so many local gossip channels looking for outrage
"Hello everyone. I'm turning 20 later this year and I really need advice. Currently, I am a Polytechnic student in my third year. This semester I was supposed to resit for a module that I had previously failed.However, I am absolutely terrified about how I would score in that module. I'd say I have improved but I doubt its enough to pass. I am scared at the possibility that I would be removed from the course considering I might have failed the module twice. I've contacted one of my lecturers and I am meeting him soon for advice with my predicament but I would like to learn more about what do you think I should do next ?I am aware of the possibility of overseas education but unfortunately that is not within my means. I am also aware about the route of applying to DAE after NS but I'm really doubtful about the chances of successfully enrolling. I am not sure what to do anymore. For now, all I have is a an O Level Certificate detailing the grades of the papers I took in 2015.I have heard about 10 month-long preparatory A Level courses provided by SmartLabs and Inspire Edu. I am sceptical about them too but I would like to hear your thoughts on them too. I am considering using the allowance I would get from NS to pay for this.I have a horrendous GPA, I've wasted my tertiary education and my dreams of going to university are gone. All because I was too weak to battle my problems with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I really need your help on what you think I need to do next.All criticisms, advice and responses are graciously welcome. Thank you."
"Please dont go university if you cant cope with polytechnic. 2-3 times harder.If you really want, i think SIT is your best bet for decent uni in Singapore. But since your gpa is terrible, you better have something in your portfolio to back you up."
It's not the courseload itself that I can't cope with though. Sometimes my mental stuff goes away and I've gotten pretty good grades. I have no avenues to get help for this so I'm doing the best I can to combat it myself.
"So what you meant is you cant focus? Because from what i read you are having those issue due to stress from schoolwork.Stress in uni is another level, unless you just want to graduate without honours. Local public universities require 3 and above"
It's not from schoolwork. It's from like really dark stuff like child neglect and child abuse. My first descent into depression which led me to be a bulimic for 9 months actually took place before I started my course.
"Sorry to hear about this. I dont really have experience in this so take my advice with a pinch of salt.I personally think that you should seek help on this, since it will affect whatever you do in the future, be it studies or work."
It's okay. Thank you for trying to help me. I'm not sure of any help I can get myself.
"Do try and seek out a psychiatrist - you can go to the gp and get a referral iircAnd remember, if the psychiatrist isn't working out for you, find another one. You're not the problem, they are. There is help out there. Please seek it.Edit: if you need someone to talk to, SOS (Samaritans of Singapore) is FREE AND AVAILABLE 24/7. Give em a call. 1800-221 4444"
You can try to find your school's counsellor. It'll be confidential and your parents won't be involved. CHAT@Scape is good too
"If you want to get help, do it fast. Going through the polyclinic -> hospital route takes at least a month, and therapy also takes time. Not sure how long the GP route will take."
"You still can go uni, only difference is it will not be a Singapore public university. Just score at least gpa 2.0."
"Was a Poly drop out too. 3rd semester. Failed a module twice.Looking at your replies, you still have 1 more paper to go so all hope is not lost. You can work really hard for this final paper to prove that you are serious about your studies or you can fail it and prove them otherwise.When you get your results, if you fail the module twice like I did, you will probably have a chance to get an appeal. That's where your performance for the last few semester comes into play. If you had a good GPA or at least passed the other modules, you have a higher chance of them 'closing one eye' and allowing you to continue that last module because you had proof that you were serious about your studies. I know some people who were given that chance. However if you were like me and had horrible results (GPA of 1.X lol), your chances of them closing one eye is quite slim.If you were like me and had a bad GPA and failed a module twice, you can still apply and appeal to the course after NS through DAE. Although the way the school select is to give higher priority to those who have never been to Poly before.If you do fail the module twice and gets dismissed, take the next 2 years in NS to 'heal' yourself so to speak and find yourself. Maybe you realize that you like something else more. I got dismissed and thought the whole world was ending. IDK how many times I had suicidal thoughts but eventually the day came and I was accepted into another Poly, a fresh start. I thought the last course was my dream job but I realized I found more happiness and satisfaction from the new course. Now I'm in a job that I love , with a GPA that allows me to go to Uni (but I have no money for further studies lol). Uni don't usually care about whether you were a poly dropout or not, only your last results.Life doesn't always go as planned but you will eventually get to where you need to go."
Thank you so much man. Your story gave me hope. Like you made it in the end. May I ask like when you apply via DAE did you use the O Level Results you scored in Secondary School or did you take them again ?
"I used my O level results from secondary school. You will hear stories here and there that your O level results will expire within a few years but it's all bs lol btw if you do have to apply to Poly again via DAE, don't forget to send your application to all the Polys in SG. You have to check all the Poly for their DAE period and manually apply to each of them. So technically 12 applications, 12 chances."
Go pick up some blue collar skills like plumbing or aircon. Pay for further education
"The education system around the world is made to suit that nation's need. Something like forcing the entire animal kingdom to run a land marathon, just to determine who is at the top of the food pyramid.Assuming you're a falcon, don't be a dumbass and do a land marathon. It's easier for you to look elsewhere if you wanna provide value to society.I would suggest you list down the skills you currently have. Rmb, don't compare what you have with what other's have. For example, everyone has the conversational skill, even if you really don't talk much, List this as one of your skills, don't reject it just cause you know of someone who can do it better than you.After you have a list of skills, pinpoint the skills which you are strongest in. Once again, don't base it off other people, base it off on how often you apply the skills.Last would be to ask yourself how your skills would provide value for others.For example:Top three skill:Washing dishes and clearing table (household upkeeping / office maintenance)Know where to find the best food stall in sengkang neighbourhood (Tourism / guide)Analysing video gameplay (Entertainment)For first skill - - value add society by 1) helping elderlies (paid nursing) 2) Open social media page to teach people how to tidy houses effectively and offer your service such as $50 one-time consultation 3) Brand it to ride the new green initiative trend.I want to emphasise that providing care for elderlies is a sunrise trend and still relatively blue ocean, please consider this path if you are out of better options. I won't be taking this path cause I am already too far in on my own lane and it's costly for me to jump onto this trend now.For Second skill - - 1) Facebook and blog documentation 2) start airbnb experience 3) intern at tour startups. Currently can find a lot of these startups on glints and indeed.For third skill - - Pick presentation method: 1) video 2) podcast 3) blog. I would prefer podcast cause it's interactive but not too expensive.Instead of doing what other YouTubers does, Twist your analysis into daily life interaction. And throw in some philosophy into your analysis. You can ref. youtube 理科太太Be creative and don't pin your self worth to companies. No company would discriminate you but neither would they spend resources to groom just anyone who applies for their job.So you must build yourself up and keep trying. Remember that one semester of UNI is currently near 4k. You might as well spend the money on Start Up ventures, on Freelance Ventures, On specific courses provided online. E.g. Masterclass by famous directors.The world is leaving traditional education institutes behind, don't hop onto a sunset trend if you cannot dominate.Lastly, have patience!!!! As a UNI student, the top performers whom I've seen are always those that have patience. This means that they don't mind starting from ground 0. For example, in Y1, I had a classmate who did not take A levels Chem. However, he went and find his own study material and focus his time on Chemistry. He ended up being a first class honors. Mind you, our course have poly students who basically had learnt the lab modules and slightly advanced chem which are taught in Y1. This man didn't just give up but spend most of his time learning the foundation plus the uni resources.SO REMEMBER TO HAVE PATIENCE. THE TOP PERFORMERS IN LIFE ARE PATIENT AND MASTERS OF THEIR OWN MIND AND BODY.You have spent quite some time running in a wrong path so for you to switch lane would take a lot of effort. However, It's always smarter to be the king of a small kingdom than a peasant of a large kingdom."
"Focus on the here and now. Fail already or not? If not yet, study and focus on that module and any other module that sets you up for failure. What's your GPA? Mine was 2.1 (of 4.0) when I finally graduated from Poly. Tips for studying? Remove all distraction and just hit the books. That new addictive game Apex Legends? Uninstall it. That hot date with a girl? Reschedule it. and So on. Your future is in your hands not your parents nor anyone else. But if you fail to discipline yourself, don't worry. Army will help teach you about discipline."
I don't know for a fact that I have failed though. Results would be out in Mid march. But thanks for the message I needed it. I have one more paper to study and I wasted my time being upset over the weekend.
"Ok. 1 more paper to go. Studying hard for it means 1 less paper to fail. Ask your class mates for help if you can. If no one is free to entertain you, then go alot earlier to school on test date (1-2 hours before) and study. If you see any course mates at the canteen or outside test hall ask them about somethings you have trouble understanding. After finish test then play to your hearts content till March and one last thing once you get all the response you need, get off reddit till your last paper is over."
Thank you so much man. I really needed this.
"All because I was too weak to battle my problems with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts.Has this been dealt with? No point having this come up again if you try a new route."
I am managing it better than I did in the past though I don't have a support system or anyone I could confide in. My own parents found it way too much for them to handle it when I couldn't take it anymore bottling up to myself and decided to talk to them about it. I also cannot afford having a therapist.
"You can work with a diploma qualification and maybe after 2/3 years take a part time degree once you realize what career trajectory you wanna take. It’s not the end of the world. You’re still very young. I understand that you’re feeling overwhelmed and unsure about the future. There’s a term for this, called quarterlife crisis. You’ll figure things out. Don’t worry. 😊Most importantly. Try your best to to be positive and don’t compare yourself with others, their successes or achievements. Honestly if you know how Effed up some people are, you’d be surprised. It’s really not important what’s important is you. It’s your life and don’t let anyone make you feel inadequate or tell you that you’re not gonna succeed or that you can’t go to university or whatever. Dude it’s bullshit. You can do it. First thing is figuring out what works for you."
Thanks man. Really supportive. I'm just worried I'll get kicked out of this course because I might have failed a module twice.
https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/degree-programs-courses-70/retaking-levels-ns-5316324-3.html^ this dude got shitty GPA in poly then decided to take A levels during ns and he made it with AAB/A :-)
wow!
"First things first, talk to your lecturer, listen to what he has to say. Maybe there's a way to salvage the Diploma that he can advise you. The fact that he's willing to speak to you means there is still hope and a chance to finish strong, so don't give up yet.Besides your lecturer, do consider tapping on counselling offered by your Poly, it may not be top-grade, but it's better than nothing for now. Also, do talk to your family, be open, hang out with friends, basically set up a strong support network for yourself too. No man is an island.Diploma wise, just do your best and try to stay on in the course (you're already in Y3, it's the final lap between you and your Diploma cert). Regardless of the GPA, getting the Diploma will open more doors for you as compared to just your 'O' Levels cert. There's always options to beef up your diploma (e.g. internships, courses, certifications, Advanced/Specialist Dips) that can enhance the resume but don't involve going to Uni.No matter how your Diploma turns out, the next stage of life will be NS. Take it as a chance to understand yourself, to grow as a person, to try something new. True, it may be sapping 2 years of your life, it may pay shit, it may be shag, but you'll learn more about yourself, you'll meet new people, and it'll a journey you'll both cry and smile about because it happened."
think of your end goal first. does the career you want require a degree?
Yes it does. I am actually in a course that I like which makes things sting even more.
"I'm from Temasek Poly and currently finishing my fourth and final year. As a 21M with a cGPA of less than 1.5 I am not going anywhere. I have also experienced the same thing as you; depression, relationship, gaming. I visited the CMBP shrink a week ago and will probably enlist in June. I plan to spend this two years in NS, with whatever free time, to study and prepare for A-Levels.I am skeptical about taking an online course for this as the risk is pretty great and if any, very few people take the route we do. I have decided that I will enroll in Raymond's Math Studio tuition center in a month or two to start, when I have the money. I feel that this route is the safest and closest to the Singapore syllabus as compared to the online avenues you mentioned. And of course, if you're enrolled in a science or business course, it is important to study the A-Levels to your strengths, and remember a General Paper (GP) is required for a 'complete' GCE-A Level certificate.We should chat if you have the time. I struggle to find others in the same quandary as I am."
Thanks man. It's a little comforting to hear from someone in a similar predicament as I am in. I'll DM you sometime as I'm studying atm.
"Pass this well, it could help your case if you were to miss the mark. Good luck!"
Seems like a problem SIM can solve
So you haven't failed it a 2nd time but already identify as a poly dropout.. :(
Kinda yeah. But I spoke to my lecturer earlier and he said it's likely I could continue if I chose to appeal. I don't know my score but I have a bad vibe about it.
"Hey man, it's not over yet! For a moment I thought you really dropped out.You're still in the game, so do everything you can to stay in it. Having a diploma is better than just Os, so you can still do something with it. Don't forget to take breaks and give your brain time to breathe too.Also, university is not necessarily better for you; we all lead different lives and walk different paths. Always do your best and be on the lookout for opportunities; not all of them require a degree. All the best!"
Pretty sure you will be better off not reading any of these shitty life pro tips in the comments lol
Poly and uni are good to have but not a must have. Most people earning big money nowadays did not go poly/uni. Cheer up!
You have stats to back up that claim?
Most people also swallowed contents of buzzfeed articles and take them to be true
GO for private UNI that hire PROFS WHO HAVE REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE OR HAVE THEIR OWN BUSINESS.How do you know about it before you apply?

"Inspired by a recent post on the Melbourne subreddit, I put together a map with 52 places to visit in Singapore. The simple idea is to have a different/new place to visit for every weekend for a year.I left out (most) of the typical tourist attractions and there is no particular sequence or logic behind the list of places.I have been to all but two of those places in the past, however, some of the places may be closed at the moment (e.g. Sembawang Hot Spring). All places should be free of charge.Happy to receive any kind of feedback or ideas for additional locations. I may delete or merge some places once I find better ones.Here is the link:https://embed.alpacamaps.com/journey/fb8ca84e-2d1a-11e9-9d43-024bc0398b11/default(Map was created with Alpaca -> beta.alpacamaps.com/)"
"Really great. I've been here 8 years and there's a lot I've not seen. This helps a lot, great work"
I've been here all my life and also have not been to a lot of places listed there.
"I don't recommend Sembawang Hotsprings as it is closed for renovation for quite a while (till 30 Sep 2019). Right now the area has only a small area with only a few taps of spring water.Also Haw Par Villa is closed for renovation for now and will reopen on 1 March 2019.Holland Close Graveyard might an interesting place too, it's walkable distance from Holland Village and is surrounded by HDB (think the only one graveyard in the country in such a setting)."
"Yes, as noted, some of the places are indeed closed. Better check before planning a trip.And thanks for the tip, will check out Holland Close graveyard!"
I hope they build an onsen at the hot spring.
"Not an onsen, but they are planning to open a cafe there. You can view the details here from NParks: https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/sembawang-hot-spring-to-feature-a-floral-walk-cafe-toilets-and-other-amenities"
"I would do MacRitchie Reservoir, Jelutong Tower and Treetop Walk all in one weekend, simply because they are along the way. Also, they are activities that i consider ""one lifetime do once enough liao""."
"Yes, those (as well as some others) can easily be done in one trip. I am considering to merge some locations once I have other places to add.However, I do feel that MacRitchie is worth more than one trip in a lifetime if you life in Singapore!"
"Maybe i'm saying that because MacRitchie isn't very accessible for me since i don't drive. Although Singapore is small, public transport still takes me a while to get to MacRitchie. But still, the scenery is nice and the air is fresh."
"I agree wholeheartedly. Do them together and it's a good day out, do them over three weekends and wonder what you have done with your life."

Very good list.. !!! Thanks for the effort !! 😀👍
"This is interesting, thanks OP for putting this together."
"It’s not? What are you going to do at all the cemeteries or random houses listed? And if you are not interested in nature one bit, the whole list is basically useless."
Totally agree
Visit the cemetery?Have a nice day!
"I like these on the list - Upper Pierce Reservoir Park, Springleaf Nature Park, Ulu Sembawang PCN, Sembawang Park, Sembawang Black & White Houses, Alexandra Park Black & White Houses, Woodlands Waterfront, Japanese Cemetery Park, Chestnut Nature Park, Little Guilin, Singapore Quarry, Bukit Batok Nature Park, Chinese & Japanese Gardens, Jurong Hill TowerWould like to suggest Tampines Eco Green Park and Jurong Eco Garden too :)"
tiagong Eco Parks are for outdoor sex. better Siam.
Tampines Eco Green Park not much there except dead lizards and being mosquito food.
Interesting
"OP, should rename Seletar Park to Upper Seletar Reservoir, as there's no Seletar Park."
"You are right, thanks!"
there used to be this awesome teppanyaki at jurong hill; no more :(
I remember as well. Used to go there all the time!
"Thank you.Ps, how about Food? Places for food?"
There are just too many to keep track!
"Think it may be a good idea if you want to continue this mini project of yours, tag a nearby food place to visit before/after going to these 52 places!"
"For those interested in Singapore history, here's two other fascinating places (IMO)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istana_Woodneukhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Tanjong_Katong"
"Istana WoodneukIstana Wooden York, more popularly referred as Istana Woodneuk (before its rebuilt in 1935 of the said building), is an abandoned two-storey palace at the former Tyersall Park bound by Holland Road and Tyersall Avenue near the Singapore Botanic Gardens in Singapore. It was currently in its dilapidated state and its surroundings were covered by thick vegetation. The dilapidated palace as well as the land it sits on is a private land still belong to the State of Johor, it is not charted on most modern maps and currently out of bounds to outsiders.The former palace had commonly been confused with the demolished Istana Tyersall due to its proximity, which was located on another hill not far away.Fort Tanjong KatongFort Tanjong Katong, which stood from 1879 to 1901, was one of the oldest military forts built by the former British colonial government of Singapore. The fort gave its name to today's Fort Road, and it used to stand on the grounds of the present Katong Park. Fort Tanjong Katong, the only one of its kind on the eastern side of the island, was part of a series of defensive batteries and fortifications along the southern coast of Singapore, that defended the eastern approaches to the Singapore Harbour and Singapore Town against seaborne attacks. Due to its poor structural design and remoteness, the fort was subsequently abandoned and buried until its rediscovery in 2001.[ ^PM | Exclude ^me | Exclude from ^subreddit | FAQ / ^Information | ^Source ] Downvote to remove | v0.28"
It sounds like Istana Woodneuk was the inspiration for Tyersall Park in Crazy Rich Asians!
"Instana Woodneuk has police cameras all over starting from the bus stop. A police car will drop by within 5-15mins if you're spotted walking in as it's considered trespassing. Was personally caught when I went a couple years back as part of the then hype on social media, but because we were part of almost 20 people rounded up (various groups) and they had only 2 cop cars, they took our names and warned us not to come back.The officer said normally small groups will be guaranteed a trip to Tanglin police station."
Why though
Private property and very dilapidated and thus potentially dangerous I suppose. There were literal sections of staircases and floors missing.
"Strange recommendation, but I would say visit the universities in Singapore. I personally like to visit universities when I travel overseas.Sure, there’s nothing really much for tourists/ non-students of the university to see or do. However, I like to compare the architecture, building design and much more of universities in different countries. It’s quite amazing to see how places of education can feel mundane or exciting just by the design of the place."
I would suggest Gillman Barracks is a far better day out than almost everything on this list. It can be tied to the Henderson Waves/ Mount Faber walk.And Black & White Houses? Hell naaaaw.
"Not only foreigners leh, 80% of Singaporeans also cannot buy"

"4rm 5xxk, but the location is really good."
Not really looking for a BTO now but are there criterias/factors that come into play for you to get a chance of getting a slot ?
"The biggest tipping point, I believe, is if you're married/have a family. HDB prioritises couples over singles, and also offers them more subsidies. Also, salary. Not too sure about the exact numbers, but if you (or if you're married, you and your spouse) earn more than what the BTO allows, you're probably not gonna get it."
Pretty sure 20% of Singaporeans don't have fuckyou money. Maybe 0.1%?
The article is talking about GCBs. I'm pretty sure less than 0.5% of Singaporeans can afford a GCB.
"OK, I'll be very honest and admit I didn't read the article before the comments. I'm used to GCB meaning Golden Chi Bai and was totally confused (yet amused) with your comment.Today I found out in sg real estate GCB means Good Class Bungalow lol."
95% of Singaporeans would be more accurate
"Foreigners can apply to the Commissioner of Land to own a landed property. That includes GCB. There is a criteria to be met before approval is given. Contribution to the country, investment brought in etcHouse, location etc are also considered as it’s is not a blanket approval.Foreigners who get approval also help maintain the value in bad times and generate capital appreciation in good times."
"Very very rare, and almost impossible unless you're PR, which is also extremely difficult. What the fuck do you have to do to own a home like that man....."

"Singaporeans loving the luxury homes foreigners can't buySINGAPORE (BLOOMBERG) - Some of Singapore's most desirable houses come with a catch: only locals can own them.That foreign buyers - notably from China - who for years helped drive demand for luxury homes, can't buy these dwellings, hasn't dented their appeal. Their scarcity and the exclusivity they confer have pushed prices of the homes - known as Good Class Bungalows, or GCBs - to record highs, even as the broader property market cools.Just about 2,500 GCBs dot the city-state, ranging from colonial-era houses to architect-designed modern homes with cantilevered verandas, infinity pools and expansive landscaped gardens, a world away from the high-rise condos most Singaporeans call home.In a recent blockbuster deal, Tony Tung, the chairman of Hong Kong-based oil trader Winson Group, bought a bungalow near the Botanic Gardens for $105.3 million, the Business Times reported earlier this month, saying it was a record for a GCB. Nearby, a Singaporean member of the Tsai family, who made their fortune in insurance in Taiwan, snapped up a bungalow for $93.9 million.More records may soon be broken. A new bungalow near the Botanic Gardens, featuring a central courtyard pool and water garden, will soon hit the market with an asking price of $3,500 per square foot. That would surpass the previous record of $2,700 per square foot set last year, according to KH Tan at Newsman Realty, who is handling the sale.""Due to scarcity and exclusivity, the GCB market has always been regarded as the jewel of the residential market and a coveted trophy asset to the well-heeled community,"" said Sammi Lim, director of capital markets at real estate agency CBRE Group Inc. ""GCBs have proven to be a resilient asset class through market cycles.""That's proving to be the case again as a rally in home prices stalls following the imposition of further property curbs in the middle of 2018. House values declined 0.1 per cent in the three months ended Dec 31, snapping five straight quarterly gains.Related Story Yongnam boss selling his Binjai Park good class bungalow for $40mRelated Story A glimpse of Good Class Bungalows, the biggest and rarest houses hereRelated Story A peek inside three beautiful bungalows in SingaporeThe citizenship requirement isn't the only restriction on GCBs. The plot must be at least 1,400 square meters, and the house can't take up more than 35 per cent of the land, or be more than two stories high. Such luxurious use of space is another status symbol in one of the world's most densely-populated countries, where about 7,900 people are crammed into each square kilometre.Singapore is also one of the wealthiest nations on Earth - home to the ninth-highest number of millionaires - according to Credit Suisse Research Institute's 2018 Global Wealth Report.That's helped underpin activity in the GCB market, with the number of transactions rising 47 per cent in the second half of 2018 compared with the first six months of the year, according to CBRE.Typical buyers are super-wealthy locals, and foreigners who have attained citizenship, said Mr Tan, managing director at Newsman Realty, which specialises in bungalow deals.""The super rich want to buy the best diamond, the best car, so in Singapore residential, the Good Class Bungalow is the best you can get,"" Mr Tan said.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"
"I once remembered reading this book called ""Walking the Tycoon's tightrope"". In it, there were a few paragraphs about how Hong Kong's tycoons, in fear of 1997 handover, decided to shift some assets to Singapore. They flew down to Singapore to meet with the government and decided to invest in building Suntec City. As part of the investment, some of them got special permission to buy GCBs."
"Every year when the budget is unveiled there is almost always an increase in government spending in various areas. This year is no different. However, in order to mantain a balanced budget, government revenue has to similarly increase, usually coming from taxes.Corporate tax and personal income tax, often regarded as quite low relative to the rest of the world, makes up ~38% of revenue. The other ~60% of revenue comes from various indirect taxes (GST~ 15%, stamp duty ~6%, vehicle quota premium ~4%, ""fees and charges""~ 4%, ""other taxes""~ 9%, asset tax ~6%, customs and excise ~4% etc.) These indirect taxes add up, and have a tangible effect on the cost of living, which is a significant source of frustration for many.While there is public sentiment against raising taxes further (evidenced by the speculation of a further 2% increase in GST last year), is there a desire for a reduction in taxes if it meant a commensurate reduction in government spending? Would such a policy be worth it?Is there scope to cut spending in the first place? (Such as waste i.e $300k to rename marina bay to marina bay, duplication of services, and consolidation of govt agencies)Which areas would you like to see government spending cut? (Across all sectors including healthcare, education, welfare)"
"Not all taxes are the same. Certainly progressive taxation as a source of funding has a place in a rich country such as ours.More tiers for personal income tax should be introduced. Estate tax and capital gains tax should also come in.GST, being regressive, should be kept at 7% or lowered in lieu of these schemes."
No one has ever asked whether they would rather choose a 7% GST and increase income tax especially on the wealthy instead of just a 9% GST. There’s a lot of room to increase income tax rates. Doing so along people to take a whack at income inequality.
"What about cutting spending? If we were unable to raise any new taxes, do you think we should cut spending in order to be able to reduce some of these regressive indirect taxes?"
Difficult to say. I'm not privy to the breakdowns in the various ministries.I will say that we shouldn't cut healthcare funding (as a doctor).
"Is there a need to identify spending efficiencies and get rid of such inefficiencies? You bet.If there’s one we should cut it is elderly entitlement programs such as Medeka Generation Package and Pioneer Generation Package. I don’t really know whether such programs has led to better outcomes.But I don’t think we should cut spending on stuff that is crucial, like healthcare. There’s a lot of criticism over at the NHS over the cut in healthcare spending. Also, spending cuts on education has led to cutting of teachers wages. That’s not really fair isn’t it."
Medeka Generation Package and Pioneer Generation PackageMost of the moola goes to healthcare though (they are the group that needs the increase in healthcare budget)
stop pouring money into the blackhole called the military industrial complex
"Definitely there will be implications if we cut spending in order to cut taxes. But there will also be implications when the govt increases spending, as it intends to do in the coming budget, and needs to raise taxes to pay for them. After all, higher taxes have a direct impact on the wallets and livelihoods of everyone, especially the middle class and the poor. Certaintly there are trade offs that have to be made, but seeing as taxes are levied on the populace in order to pay for things they ostensibly want, surely the question of how to strike that balance is a worthwhile question for people to discuss, not just a government committee.I agree that there are probably plenty of good descions made about how to spend our money that we probably don't know about. But on the other hand there are probably other instances of waste and abuse that are not publicised. I don't think there's anything wrong with saying that we should have more transparency and oversight regarding how and where public money is spent.There is no shortage of good intentions, what I'm afraid of is our bureaucrats spending on things that are useful but people don't really want or really need and then using it to justify higher taxes. (Pioneer/merdeka, sgbonus, bicentennial, wage credit, productivity credit, etc.)I'd like to see the taxes on the middle classes and poor reduced too, but I also have reservations about raising taxes on the rich. Hence the question about the possibility of cutting expenditure.Probably sounds like a pro-government pieceNothing wrong with it if it's what you believe."
"You seem to have a problem with the ruling party collecting $300 in taxes from you, then returning that same $300 to you in the form of a GST Voucher or a Merdeka Generation Bonus to make you feel good."
"You do know that people getting large amount in GST Voucher typically don't pay income tax right?Whereas people who pay income tax tends to get less GST Voucher? It's not much for income equality, but it's something."
"Maybe, just maybe if the ministers stopped being so overpaid we'd have a whole chunk of cash to invest back into our broken ass systems"

"""Low-sugar"""
"Unrelated but ugh, I always cringe whenever I see people touch their water tumblers or bottles with the water fountain spout. It’s a unhygienic. I see it in public places and I see it on this main image where our kids are suppose to learn about this."
"Some primary schools are stepping up the war on sugar by halting the sale of sweet drinks to pupils. At least three primary schools have done away with drink stalls - previously a regular feature in canteens - altogether, a check by The Straits Times has found.More than a dozen others have banned certain drinks from the stalls on their premises.This comes against the backdrop of the tightening of sugar guidelines for beverages sold in schools in recent years.Jurong West Primary School, for instance, has not had a drink stall since May 2017, when the last stall owner discontinued her lease. Instead, pupils bring their own drinks from home, usually water or juices, said Mr Lim Chin Guan, the vice-principal. Vending machines dispensing low-sugar drinks are available to pupils. Mr Lim said the best time for pupils to adopt healthy habits is at a young age. ""On top of educating students on healthy eating habits, we also want to lead by example by not having a drink stall which can be a convenient source of sugary drinks,"" he said.Riverside Primary has never had a drink stall since it began taking in pupils in 2013. It also does not have any drink vending machine. Pupils bring along water bottles every day and refill them regularly at water coolers.CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace is another primary school to have done away with a drink stall.Since 2017, all mainstream schools have adopted the Healthy Meals in Schools Programme, a Health Promotion Board (HPB) initiative to get children to cultivate healthy eating habits from a young age. Getting children to drink more water and have fewer sweet drinks is part of the effort.Under the programme, sports drinks, for example, should not contain more than 6g of sugar per 100ml. Drinks that have permitted intense sweeteners are also not allowed for sale. The Ministry of Education and HPB said audit checks are carried out to ensure schools' adherence to the sugar guidelines under the programme. Some schools such as Xishan Primary, which banned the sale of carbonated drinks and bottled drinks in its canteen two years ago, have held regular assembly talks on healthy eating habits and sugar content in drinks such as bubble tea.""This helps them better understand the impact of their personal choices on their health,"" said Mrs Anne Quek, principal of the school in Yishun.Parents said they are glad that schools are taking steps to stop the sales of sugary drinks.Madam Yvonne Kong, whose two children, Gabriel, 10, and Natalie, eight, are studying at Jurong West Primary, said: ""Parents cannot always be in school to monitor what their kids eat or drink. It is good that their school doesn't have a drink stall. They can pick up the habit of drinking water instead of sugary drinks.""Madam Chen Chiau Hong, a housewife whose 10-year-old son Chin Ip attends Xishan Primary, said: ""So whatever the children choose, it is still healthier than what is sold outside.""Many pupils such as Chin Ip, a Primary 4 pupil who said he bought sugary drinks only once in a while as a treat, have welcomed the move by schools. ""Too much sugary drinks is not good for my health,"" he said. ""Whenever I am thirsty, I would drink plain water.""Research has shown that sugary drinks provide little or no nutritional benefit for growing children. Nutritionist Pooja Vig of The Nutrition Clinic noted that sugar could also be highly addictive. ""It's especially important to limit sugar because not only does sugar affect weight and dental health, but it can also affect mood and behaviour. In some instances, sugar can cause hyperactivity and interfere in a child's ability to concentrate,"" she said. Mr Derrick Ong, principal dietitian at Eat Right Nutrition Consultancy, pointed out that healthy habits inculcated from a young age tend to persist into adulthood, which would go a long way towards preventing chronic conditions such as diabetes.The next step is for parents to be educated on the ways to encourage their children to limit sugar, said Singapore University of Technology and Design faculty fellow Andrew Yee, who has done research on health communication."
Some kid is going to corner the school sugar market.
"More primary schools keep out sugary drinksMore primary schools keep out sugary drinksAt least three have done away with drink stalls altogether as war on sugar hots upsSome primary schools are stepping up the war on sugar by halting the sale of sweet drinks to pupils.At least three primary schools have done away with drink stalls – previously a regular feature in canteens – altogether, a check by The Straits Times has found.More than a dozen others have banned certain drinks from the stalls on their premises.This comes against the backdrop of the tightening of sugar guidelines for beverages sold in schools in recent years.Jurong West Primary School, for instance, has not had a drink stall since May 2017, when the last stall owner discontinued her lease.Instead, pupils bring their own drinks from home, usually water or juices, said Mr Lim Chin Guan, the vice-principal. Vending machines dispensing low-sugar drinks are available to pupils.Mr Lim said the best time for pupils to adopt healthy habits is at a young age. “On top of educating students on healthy eating habits, we also want to lead by example by not having a drink stall which can be a convenient source of sugary drinks,” he said.Riverside Primary has never had a drink stall since it began taking in pupils in 2013. It also does not have any drink vending machine. Pupils bring along water bottles every day and refill them regularly at water coolers.CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace is another primary school to have done away with a drink stall.Since 2017, all mainstream schools have adopted the Healthy Meals in Schools Programme, a Health Promotion Board (HPB) initiative to get children to cultivate healthy eating habits from a young age. Getting children to drink more water and have fewer sweet drinks is part of the effort.Under the programme, sports drinks, for example, should not contain more than 6g of sugar per 100ml. Drinks that have permitted intense sweeteners are also not allowed for sale. The Ministry of Education and HPB said audit checks are carried out to ensure schools’ adherence to the sugar guidelines under the programme.Some schools such as Xishan Pri- mary, which banned the sale of carbonated drinks and bottled drinks in its canteen two years ago, have held regular assembly talks on healthy eating habits and sugar content in drinks such as bubble tea.“This helps them better understand the impact of their personal choices on their health,” said Mrs Anne Quek, principal of the school in Yishun.Parents said they are glad that schools are taking steps to stop the sales of sugary drinks.Madam Yvonne Kong, whose two children, Gabriel, 10, and Natalie, eight, are studying at Jurong West Primary, said: “Parents cannot always be in school to monitor what their kids eat or drink. It is good that their school doesn’t have a drink stall. They can pick up the habit of drinking water instead of sugary drinks.”Madam Chen Chiau Hong, a housewife whose 10-year-old son Chin Ip attends Xishan Primary, said: “So whatever the children choose, it is still healthier than what is sold outside.”Many pupils such as Chin Ip, a Primary 4 pupil who said he bought sugary drinks only once in a while as a treat, have welcomed the move by schools. “Too much sugary drinks is not good for my health,” he said. “Whenever I am thirsty, I would drink plain water.”Research has shown that sugary drinks provide little or no nutritional benefit for growing children.Nutritionist Pooja Vig of The Nutrition Clinic noted that sugar could also be highly addictive. “It’s especially important to limit sugar because not only does sugar affect weight and dental health, but it can also affect mood and behaviour. In some instances, sugar can cause hyperactivity and interfere in a child’s ability to concentrate,” she said.Mr Derrick Ong, principal dietitian at Eat Right Nutrition Consultancy, pointed out that healthy habits inculcated from a young age tend to persist into adulthood, which would go a long way towards preventing chronic conditions such as diabetes.The next step is for parents to be educated on the ways to encourage their children to limit sugar, said Singapore University of Technology and Design faculty fellow Andrew Yee, who has done research on health communication.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"
Hard to believe anyone finds this remotely witty. That smrt page has really gone down the drain since the change of people.
Yeah I mean this is super low effort.
It was supposed to be witty? It’s primary school humour! Oh no wait don’t insult primary school kids.

I think it's more because he always looked old even when young.

Preferrably websites that ship to Singapore. I mostly use ASOS plus and I'm just curious if there are any other options other than the one I'm using. Thanks in advance
I remember seeing a sign in peninsula that advertised sizes up to XXXXXXXL (7-XL)
Yeah it's in the basement near the escalator
"I've been trying to get the Punjabi dad and son pair who's shop I used to frequent to start putting their stuff up online. As someone who previously was big enough to shop for 8XL's, lord knows I could have used a home delivery service."
"For casual, I love Amazon. They got good prices, variety, reviews, and useful info on sizing. Just make sure you know your US sizes. When buying trousers, choose the right length so you don't have to adjust. Same with sleeve lengths, collar size, etc. When buying shoes, know your shoe width as well as size (but shoes are risky if you don't try)."
Peninsula is a good start

"Hello guys. Long time lurker here, first time posting. This is a serious question and I appreciate any answers/help given.My mother in law is a Singaporean PR with a Malaysian passport. She is bound to go for her pilgrimage on April. Thing is she signed up for a package with a company in Malaysia together with her siblings who are living in Malaysia.The problem here is in order to fly to Saudi Arabia from Malaysia she is required to obtain a Visa. She has to submit her Passport on the 9/3 and will only get her passport back somewhere around 22-23/3.She is asking if it is illegal to have one of her family member come to Singapore to collect her passport and bring it back to Malaysia and apply the visa on her behalf? Does she need to sign anything beforehand and will the Customs ask the family member what is my MIL passport doing with her if they were to conduct a check?She cannot afford to stay there for two weeks as she is looking after my son and we do not have any last minute alternatives as both me and my wife are working.Thank you in advance for all the feedbacks that will be given and I hope to find a solution ASAP because my MIL is nervous and afraid that she wouldn’t be able to do her pilgrimage due to this issue.Edit: A word"
A very specific question bro that I bet no one can give a sure fire answer. Just call ICA to check easier
Yeah will probably call ICA thank you !
The most important issue is if the Malaysian passport authority will allow someone else to collect on her behalf. In SG to my knowledge the person being issued the passport must be there when it's issued.
True. Ill have my MIL called the relevant authorities there to confirm. Thank you
Can't you apply it via the Malaysian High Commission in Singapore?

"Hey, figured I'd be spontaneous so I booked a trip to Singapore for 7 days (effective days I'll have minus the travel is 5 whole days). I've already looked up all the youtubevideos and travel guides so I know stuff to see and whatnot. Just figured I'd ask if you guys have any tips of special stuff that might be extraordinary good when travelling alone, either for the view or meet other people. Tinder, bumble, what do people use? Not looking to date really, just a casual hangout.I haven't travelled a lot by myself but I usually end up talking with other people anyways so I'm not worried, but are there any tips you could give me for meeting up interesting people or other stuff that might be good when travelling alone in Singapore?Will be staying beginning of March, hotel by Orchard Rd. 23 male if that's relevant.Thanks in advance!"

"Budget 2019: Top-ups for students, GST Vouchers part of S$1.1b Bicentennial BonusSINGAPORE — About 1.4 million lower-income Singaporeans will receive up to S$300 in GST Vouchers at the end of this year, as part of the S$1.1 billion Bicentennial Bonus announced by Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat on Monday (Feb 18).WHO’S ELIGIBLE FOR THE BICENTENNIAL PAYMENT?Those aged 21 and above, who earned an income of up to S$28,000 in 2017, are eligible for the payout, called GST Voucher - Cash (Bicentennial Payment).If their home’s annual value at the end of 2018 was S$13,000 or below, they will receive S$300. If their home’s annual value at the end of 2018 was more than S$13,000 but no more than S$21,000, they will receive S$150.The annual values cover all public flats in Singapore and some private properties of lower value.WORKFARE BICENTENNIAL BONUSEmployees under the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme will receive an additional 10 per cent of their total Workfare payment for work done in 2018, with a minimum payment of $100. This will be given out in cash.Infographic: Samuel Woo/TODAYThe payments are a way to commemorate Singapore’s bicentennial year, which marks 200 years since Sir Stamford Raffles landed here, said Mr Heng in his Budget 2019 speech.“From time to time, when our finances allow, we share the surpluses with Singaporeans, and provide more help to those with specific needs,” he said.TOP-UPS FOR STUDENTS AND THOSE APPROACHING RETIREMENTAbout 570,000 younger Singaporeans will receive a one-off top-up to their Edusave or Post-Secondary Education Accounts this year.Those aged 7 to 16 will receive S$150 in Edusave top-ups to help pay for various enrichment activities.Those aged 17 to 20 will get S$500 in Post-Secondary Education Account top-ups if their home’s annual value is up to S$13,000 at the end of 2018, or top-ups of S$250 if their home’s annual value is higher.About 300,000 Singaporeans aged 50 to 64 will also get top-ups to their Central Provident Fund Special or Retirement Accounts.The majority of this lower-income group will be women, many of whom left the workforce early and had fewer years to build up their savings, said Mr Heng.Those who are aged 50 to 54 this year will receive S$300 or S$500, depending on how much they have in their CPF Ordinary and Special Accounts.Those aged 55 to 64 this year will receive S$600 or S$1,000, depending on how much they have in their CPF Ordinary and Special Accounts, or their Retirement Accounts.Recipients of the top-ups will also have to meet other criteria, such as not owning more than one property.PERSONAL INCOME TAX REBATE TARGETING LOWER AND MIDDLE-INCOME EARNERSResident individual taxpayers will receive a 50 per cent personal income tax rebate, subject to a cap of S$200, for income earned last year. This will cost the Government about S$280 million.“The personal tax rebate is huge in percentage but small in cap. It reflects a better policy to share the country’s surpluses in a more targeted fashion to help those with greater need,” said Mr Chester Wee, a partner and International Tax Services Leader at assurance, tax and advisory services firm Ernst and Young Solutions.BICENTENNIAL COMMUNITY FUNDMr Heng will set aside S$200 million for the Bicentennial Community Fund to encourage individuals and corporations to give back to society.The fund will provide dollar-for-dollar matching for donations made to Institutions of a Public Character from April 1 this year to March 31 next year. A cap will apply to each Institution of a Public Character.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

"Hi All, I have decided to create a weekly segment on Flora in SG and I will be talking about the different types of Plants found and commonly grown in SG.1st EPToday I will share with you Dendrobium crumenatum a.k.a as the pigeon orchid from Orchidaceae, a common species in Singapore with white flowers and alternate leaf arrangement. It flowers are fragrant and are stimulated to bloom after a decrease in temperature of 2-3 °C with heavy rain.It is not very sought after in the trade with flowers that are not showy, have messy root growth and also cant withstand humidity that is below 60%, as well as losing their leaves frequently. It is commonly found in Singapore on roadside trees throughout the whole of Singapore.Any questions, feel free to ask below and I shall end off a magnificent display of the plant below.My reference: https://florafaunaweb.nparks.gov.sg/Special-Pages/plant-detail.aspx?id=1924"
"I never knew we had wild orchids in Singapore! How often do they flower? On a related note, I bought a Ludisia discolor (Jewel orchid) today. I've never had one before; I hope it doesn't die lol.Since you seem to be knowledgeable about plants, can I alsl ask: How do you know how much water to give them? Reading up on them doesn't help me much since the size of the plant/soil/environment probably play a big role. I can never tell if I'm giving my plants too much/too little water."
Wild orchids like the the one shown only flowers after it rains. I have another species that had probably went extinct locally that flowers in the same way. dendrobium pachyphyllum. Another rare orchid is cymbidium finlaysonium. Only seen it commenly in orchard. Ludisia discolor is like a market dendrobium. Normal corridor conditions but avoid sun from 11- 4pm cause it might cook the leaves. I pot it in charcoal and lava rocks. I water mine twice everyweek.

"Would you have any advice on how to look after cacti? Soil type to use, frequency of watering, light exposure and so on.Oh, I’m referring to those small cacti. Those that are in pots small enough to put on a desk."
"Depends on the kind of cacti / succulent. For normal cacti i treat them like normal plants using normal soil but water every 3-4 days to ensure the medium is dry. For succulents i use a bonsai soil mix with about 20% sand so it isn't very water retaining. My succulents seem to be happy with the soil mix i use. But also like orchids, succulents cannot be put under late morning to afternoon sun. They tend to cook or dehydrate easily. But for cactuses it is ok to throw it out in the open for the whole day."
Do the flower buds start forming only after the rain? Or do they produce flower buds that never open until there is rain?

I just reached out to the nearest photo studio and they quoted me 18 Dollars for a Soft copy and 28 dollar for hard copy + Soft copy. I think it is a rip off and not planning to go there.Can someone suggest a reasonable place to take passport size photo? I'm getting a professional help since the photo is for a visa. Else I would have taken it myself using my DSLR. I'm okay to shell out 10SGD for a soft copy.
"Definitely a rip off... for my visa I took with my phone, cropped and pasted my face onto a white background and got it printed"
"This is honestly what my family members have been doing, its rlly WAY cheaper."

Lol. Just use the Photo Boxes you see in MRT stations and Bus Interchanges. They cost I think 8 dollars. I've used those to apply for Taiwan and Korean Visas and had no issue with them.
"Nope. Just ask your family to take a photo of you against a white wall and do online submission. Free, been doing it for years"
i renewed my passport with a phone selfie in daylight against a white hdb void deck wall
"For printing, I always just size it according to dimensions and print it as a 40cents 4R and cut it out myself with scissors. Worked for work resumes. As for the photo taking itself, I dont see why you cant use your DSLR. I've just used my phone on a stand, sometimes I just use cleverly angled selfie ( used my own ""selfies"" many times for passport photo)."
"Perhaps, I'm just being overly conscious about the visa Process. I generally tend to do perfection while submitting documents in formal application."
"Hi, perhaps you could try ID photo booths? The lighting and clarity of photos taken there are quite up to standard, and I used this method to renew my passport photo!"
Where do you stay? I can help you take for free. All my neighbors look for me too.
Wow. Appreciate your helpful mind.I stay in the central area.
"Yeah sorry, food luck with finding a professional for that price. Worked fine for me for passport photo’s"
"Phone photo, photoshop to clear shadows, clean up hairstyle."
Download ICA app and print out ic photo at those harvey nornam shops.
Expensive! Go to any HDB town and there will be places who'll do it for around $8. They'll take the photo for you and you can collect within 10 minutes.
"Star vista, about $12 if I remember correctly, photo booth in the basement."
I'm looking for a Professional studio. is this an automated photo booth you normally see in MRT stations?
The $18 you got quoted is not a rip off for a professional studio. You should just go to a booth if no budget.
"The ST times Mr Rajab, and finds that he has to spend about two minutes outside the door to complete the process if a person is not home. If someone is at home, it takes just one minute. ""I know doing all these can protect us from complaints from customers but sometimes technology can also be a waste of time,"" says Mr Rajab.For instance, the app at times cannot detect the barcode even after multiple tries and he ends up having to manually key in the barcode number. This happens at least three times throughout the day.I bet the postmen have complained about this a million times and no one gave a shit.But now that this particular issue has appeared on the ST, some big-shot upstairs who reads this article will probably finally ask one of his underlings to take a look at it."

"If revising the app costs more than $100,000, guess what will they do?"

"While i agree with the need to improve the lives of the postman, why would the company agree to any extra funds since profits goes to bonus for management and dividend to shareholders?To the management, is there any incentives to improve the lifes of the workers?"
"Extra efficiency means postmen can do more in the same time period, which means increase profits. Whether the increase in efficiency is worth the cost is another issue."
"If you just push the workload to your workers without caring if they can meet the targets, you still might get 'higher efficiency' without spending more. Leading to a greater profit margin and more bonus for management.If the workers cant meet the target, thats ground for not increasing their pay.A 'win-win' scenarios.More efficient postman do not generate greater demand for deliveries. So why spend money on making postman more efficient?Edit typo: 'with' to 'without'"
"And this is the problem with companies nowadays. Blame goes to the workers, credits (and money) goes to the management"
"And this is also why you have postmen delivering late, throwing the mail away; they ain’t gonna give a fuck, when management doesn’t give a fuck about them.It does make business sense to take care of people."
Agree. There are a lot of things that don’t show up in KPIs and balance sheets. Taking care of your staff means they will tend to go the extra mile for the company.

"Trials of a postal system - Day in the life of a postman: Two slices of bread and a toilet break between 12 hours of workMr Rajab Abu Noh has been a postman for 43 years. He started as a 22-year-old, weaving among kampung huts and farms on a motorbike, avoiding chickens.Today, at the age of 65, he wields a smartphone and navigates high-rise buildings while dodging dogs.It remains a tough - if not even tougher - slog, given the drastically changed nature of mail delivery, as Singaporeans fall in love with the convenience of online shopping.SingPost, the national postal service provider, seems hard-put to keep pace with the developments. On Feb 7, it was fined $100,000 for failing to meet standards on the delivery of basic letters and registered mail here over six months in 2017. It comes after a string of delivery lapses, such as a postman being arrested for mail found discarded.SingPost has since vowed to lighten its postmen's workload and review their pay, among other measures, to improve service quality.To better understand how such service lapses could have occurred and the gruelling pace that postmen undergo, The Sunday Times followed Mr Rajab around as he goes about a usual workday.FUEL FOR A DAY'S WORKIt is 6.30am on a Wednesday, and he is at the sorting area at Serangoon North Regional Delivery Base, one of seven across the island.He scarfs down his breakfast - two slices of bread with butter and kaya and a cup of coffee. That would have to fuel him through the next 12 hours of work as he opts not to stop for lunch. Save for a 10-minute trip to the toilet at 3pm, he takes no breaks.Mr Rajab's daily route takes him through 38 condo blocks of about 1,750 residential units in the Yio Chu Kang/Sengkang area.At 7.30am, he begins to carefully sort the mail according to the floors in their respective blocks. Any error means he will later have to double back to the correct block or level during delivery.At 9am, the postmen gather for a briefing. The inspector of post reminds them of complaints about missed deliveries or articles damaged when the bulky items were squeezed into letter boxes.He tells them to report back if letter boxes are full so that residents can be reminded - by slipping notices under their door - to clear them. He also reprimands the postmen for leaving the master lock for letter boxes unlocked in four instances in one neighbourhood.The meeting ends. Mr Rajab looks at the mountain of mail - a mix of letters and packages - piled high in a trolley and quickens his pace.There is no way he can put it all into the storage box on his three-wheeler scooter without its heavy weight affecting his balance. So he takes half of it and will collect the rest later at a SingPost storeroom at an HDB block along his route.He departs the base at 11am.MOUNTAIN OF MAILSingPost has to deliver three million mail items daily. With a fleet of 1,000, this works out to 3,000 pieces for each postman.However, 350 out of the 1,000 delivery persons are part-timers, mostly housewives and retirees.There are no fixed hours: a postman has to deliver his mail load for the day, which varies, before he can knock off. Each usually delivers mail to some 20 blocks in an area.In the past, this volume of mail might still have been manageable, given that they were mainly letters that could be shoved quickly into letter boxes. A postman made an average of only 20 to 25 doorstep deliveries of packages a day in 2010.Now, such doorstep deliveries have doubled for non-peak periods and can go up to 50 or 60 during the year-end peak season.This means Mr Rajab works from 7.30am to about 6pm every day, or up to 8pm if overtime work - for which he is paid extra - is needed.In the past, he could have called it a day at about 3pm.Despite such time pressures, he says no postman should have to resort to dumping mail to cope with their schedules or vent frustration.SingPost says it intends to alleviate their load by hiring 100 more postmen as a short-term measure.Four hours after he starts work, at about 11.30am, Mr Rajab arrives at his first port of call, a condominium in Yio Chu Kang. He has to deliver letters to 13 blocks there.At the bottom of a block, Mr Rajab whips out a Samsung Galaxy A4 smartphone.Since January, all postmen are issued smartphones loaded with SingPost's Smartpost app. It is meant to assist the postman as well as ensure he delivers mail in a timely and appropriate manner.Mr Rajab uses it to scan a Near-Field Communication (NFC) tag mounted on the wall next to the centralised area of letter boxes. This is for the postman to clock his time of arrival and departure.He then proceeds to slot mail and advertisements into the letter boxes. Registered articles, and regular mail that cannot fit into the letter boxes, have to be taken to the doorsteps of the residents.He goes up to a residential unit, rings the doorbell twice, knocks on the door and calls out ""Postman"". There is no response.So Mr Rajab opens the app on his phone and scans the barcode on the registered mail. Once the code is detected, a countdown timer of 45 seconds is activated to ensure that the postman waits for a sufficient amount of time at the door.After 45 seconds, the smartphone screen switches to camera mode for the postman to take a photo of the unit number as proof that he had attempted delivery. Then Mr Rajab notes down the time on the delivery notice, and slots it in a crevice in the door.""No luck this time, no one in,"" he mutters under his breath.Contrary to the perception that postmen prefer to just leave a failed delivery notice at the door and scoot off quickly, it actually takes him twice as long to complete all the steps to log a failed delivery on the smartphone system, compared with if the recipient was home.The ST times Mr Rajab, and finds that he has to spend about two minutes outside the door to complete the process if a person is not home. If someone is at home, it takes just one minute. ""I know doing all these can protect us from complaints from customers but sometimes technology can also be a waste of time,"" says Mr Rajab.For instance, the app at times cannot detect the barcode even after multiple tries and he ends up having to manually key in the barcode number. This happens at least three times throughout the day.DELAYS AND BOTTLENECKAt 3.20pm, Mr Rajab finishes at a second condo, and the box at the back of his scooter is finally empty.But he is not done. He heads over to a nearby mail storeroom to collect his second batch of mail for two more condominiums. This means another bottleneck as the mail has not arrived from the base. It takes half an hour. The time ticks by.At 5.50pm, he completes all his deliveries. By then, he would have covered 38 blocks for the day, including some landed properties.He heads back to the Serangoon North base to return undelivered mail as well as returned mail.He changes out of his blue uniform at 6.30pm, some 12 hours after he started his day there.OLDER POSTMEN, LOWER PAYAfter working for 43 years, Mr Rajab's basic salary is about $1,800. He works five days a week.It is a big jump from the $300 he earned when starting out in 1976, but still below Singapore's median gross income of $4,400, which includes employer contributions to the Central Provident Fund.It is thus perhaps unsurprising that of the 650 full-time postmen, just half are Singaporeans. The rest are work permit holders from countries such as China and Malaysia.The average postman is older than the average Singapore worker - 51, versus 43 years old.SingPost says its entry-level full-time postmen draw a basic salary of $1,600 a month. It is now reviewing salaries and career progression as part of a larger review of mail operations. ""The pay is not enough and it needs to go up for more people to join. The work looks easy but it is very tough and only fit people can do this,"" says Mr Rajab, who walks with a limp.Years on the job have partly worn out his knees and he has done a knee replacement surgery on his left leg and is due for another surgery for his right knee soon.Three weeks ago, he was bitten by a large bulldog because the door was open and the dog was not leashed when he was delivering a registered article to the resident. He had to go for a vaccine injection.He had worked in a few contractor jobs after leaving Geylang Serai Vocational School but those jobs did not last long. He then joined SingPost, going for a stable job with medical and other benefits.Today, Mr Rajab is one of the oldest and longest-serving postmen.He still enjoys what he does. ""No enjoy, no work 43 years,"" says Mr Rajab simply.His wife is a housewife, and they have three children.The cheery and self-composed man chokes up when describing what makes his day.""It is when residents say: 'Hello Mr Postman, long time no see' and I will answer: 'Every day I will come and I can see you',"" he says.His only son also works in the delivery line, but as a courier.""I think he finds being a postman embarrassing and courier jobs are more popular with young people today,"" says Mr Rajab, who also has two daughters and one grandson.He says that he has no plans to retire, even though his children are all working and can support him.""I want to work as long as is possible. I don't want to retire, stay home and just makan (eat) and grow a belly,"" he says with a guffaw, gesturing wildly at his stomach."
"Gee, I wonder why we can't find Singaporeans to do this job? /s"
Let's form a committee to find out. /s
The committee shall not consist of anyone from the e-commerce sector /s
And no postmen please. What do those uneducated people know. /s
"Oh there needs to be a steering committee, working committee etc. What better ways to involve everyone too. /s"
"I’m sure it’s a decent job for $1,600. How hard could it be? /s"
those baskets don’t want to be faster cheaper better! Let’s take away benefits.
Cheaper = better and faster. Best formula ever. /s
"I feel bad for them, they are the ones delivering our items for us from one place to another yet they only get to eat one meal between 12 hours of work ??Maybe the incident where the postman threw away the letters was intentional - hoping to spark some kind of reaction LOL or maybe I’m just being delusional"
Sounds like the article had the effect it was after.
"That’s true, however they have a daily quota to fulfil, which may or may not have resorted him to skip lunch. If you read the article it states that they were experiencing time pressure and may have to work overtime as well.."
"Singpost can fuck off for trying to garner sympathy to soften their fuckups. After exploiting their overworked staff for ops, they want to pull this kind of PR campaign? Who pushed the workers to this kind of conditions? Consumers ah? It's the mgmt lor."
"Seems like it's having the opposite effect actually.While it makes me empathise with the postmen, the article also makes me feel like they're overworked cuz they're understaffed. Which makes me wanna point even more fingers at Singpost."
"Don't be mistaken, I agree with what you said. I'm just mad that they're using the guys on the ground to soften up the bad PR. ""Oh look at how hardworking our guys are, wouldn't you take pity on us?"", said the fat cat sitting in his air-conditioned office. At the end of the day, it's still the mgmt's fault for neglecting their core comp."
SMRT does this too with those “Nurzilah works till 4am every night for you” kind of ads
"The difference is that Nurzilah is on the night shift, no relations to their worker Comp. from the article, SingPost have sucky worker Comp."
It's like. Should we pity the 7 eleven staff for working till morning? No. it's called SHIFT WORK.
No yeah I was adding on to your point actually lol.
"Agree, this is also the PR stunt that SMRT pulled, by trying to get consumers to focus on the late nights that their engineers and technicians have to go through to service our trains"
"The difference is that, there are strict Work/Rest cycle in place for Technicians. Compromising it will risk safety of the pessengers."
"This is exactly what smrt has been doing mah, after the whole year or 2 of breakdowns and shit they've been on a campaign to show how much work the ground staff and technicians do. But yet management creates these shitty positions, I remember at that time smrt was hiring for service staff, but paying at a rate way below market rate."
"Ya, I remember asking one of those Smrt staff and their response was that they pick felixible hours so they can stack another job on top of that, others was because it was a split shift, they can do this part time , just need to manage their 6 hours"
"Seems like their time can be utilized better. They clock in at 6.30, but only start delivery at 11. Singpost sorting can do a better job in consolidating post by block (and maybe floor) directly."
"I think with this we can be more sympathetic towards the postmen and not direct our hate towards them. It also shines a spotlight on Singpost for their poor management. In a way it might actually help the predicament the overworked postmen are in, so I applaud this article on those grounds.If this was done for Singpost's PR then the PR team effed up badly because it doesn't do any favours for them."
It’s quite obvious the fault is with the consumers as doorstep delivery has doubled.Stop shopping online folks/s
It doesn't highlight the fact that not just parcel load increase but also advertising pamphlets as well.Singpost has taken up the business to distribute pamphlets which they didn't ten years again.Profit profit profit
"Their PR campaign is pretty much shooting themselves in their foot, because if anything it just highlighted how management is turning a blind eye to the problems on the ground, and the staff have to bear the consequences of the management's ignorance"
"Ya, I don't understand how is this painting them in a better light ?2 piece of bread + coffee to tank the day? That is insane and this was so that he could cramp in as much letter as he can."

"I belong to those households that have registered mail but no one to answer the door. And then we have to go down to the post office to pick up our stuff, clogging up the queues further. It's horribly inefficient.I wish POPstations could be expanded. Or at least have some sort of registry, so parcels go to the post office directly instead of wasting the postman's time."
"I belong to those households that have registered mail but no one to answer the door. And then we have to go down to the post office to pick up our stuff, clogging up the queues further. It's horribly inefficient.I wish POPstations could be expanded. Or at least have some sort of registry, so parcels go to the post office directly instead of wasting the postman's time.Probably a good idea to have a PopStation for maybe say every 20 to 30 blocks of HDB. Or whatever the stats say. Cuts down the queue at the post office."
This is already in testing phase in two estates. Pop stations at the void deck. There's one few blocks away from my flat.
"That's nice. I hope they go ahead with full implementation.I still remember back when I was in Singapore, the post office was a 30 minute walk away and it isn't uncommon that I had to wait another 30 minutes to retrieve my items from the counter.Would be good if the postman can leave it just 5 to 10 minutes away from your location."
"The management would see these popstations as another way to further reduce manpower.I don't see how it will lighten workload, the smaller workload will just spread between a smaller number of postman."
"Unfortunately, that is true.But I hope the postmen would still be attempting delivery the parcels before shafting them into the pop stations. The ones who would definitely be affected are the ones at the post office if we no longer have the crowds there to justify their jobs.Sadly."
"Then they can join the postmen in delivering parcels, if they wish to retain a job with SingPost"
"Nice, I hope that become a full implementation.I tend to pick pop station whenever possible since I had a bad experience when the postman tried to force a collector edition into the mailbox instead of delivering to the door.Which leads to me picking this option whenever possible so I can have my parcel and at the same time, hope that this might make it easier for postman to just place it there"
"Ninjavan uses local retail shops as temporary deposits for when the owners are not at home. Its much better. The local retail shop owner earns a bit of spare cash, the consumer doesn't have to go all the way down to the nearest post office and the post office becomes more productive by not having to handle these customers who missed the delivery.They should look into such alternatives."
"Same. Though deliverymen other than the ones from Singpost will ask if they can leave it in our shoerack (that has a door and is covered up), but I know that’s time the Singpost mailmen dont have.Worse is Singpost redirects all our undelivered mail to a post office that’s a 15-min drive away rather than the one that’s just one MRT stop away. I don’t drive so I always have to trouble my dad to go pick it up on his way back from work."
I wish they would make better use of them as well. I had to RMA a couple of items and they always sent a courier to my house but they can only do so during working hours on weekdays where no one will be able to be at home. It would be great if we can just drop off the item at the POPstation instead.
"They work 12+ hours for $1600. The pay is really pathetic. A fresh poly grad can easily get 1800 - 2300. No wonder most locals shun the job, forcing them to hire PRCs which led to the mail dumping incident. This is what happens when you exploit labour."
Which is why they need to set a recommended minimum monthly wage and set in accordance to the inflation rate of 5 years.
Bus driver / captain earn significantly more than poly grads too.
Security sector is the same. The pay for security guards are low and yet they get blame if anything is damaged or lost. Question is why they may peanuts for people to guard millions worth of assets or potential lawsuits for millions? Even the insurance premiums are not so cheap.
Lol how come they not protected under the MOM Employment Act? Poor PRCs
They aren't? Citation needed.
From what I read it seems they are covered just weird they are working such long hours.Who is covered by the ActYou are covered if you are an employee working under a contract of service with an employer.It covers local and foreign employees.An employee can be employed in the following terms:Full-timePart-timeTemporaryContractAn employee can be paid on the following basis: HourlyDailyMonthlyPiece-ratedEdit: Quoting
"Anyone can do != anyone will doIf you have a shitty job that no one wants to do, the supply of manpower is low and in turn, wages should go up, but thanks to global overpopulation and currency differences, we get fucked up shit like this"
"when they can sit in a comfy office and still earn even moreIf there is a choice between a higher paying but more physically demanding job vs a lower paying but more comfy job, there would definitely be people taking the higher paid job. If pay for such jobs ever get that high of course.What you're rather suggestingNo, I didn't suggest anything, don't put words in my mouth."
"Despite such time pressures, he says no postman should have to resort to dumping mail to cope with their schedules or vent frustration.respect for such a professional"
Could be ever say the opposite to a news media?
"What's the point of this article? If postman are overworked, it's still singpost fault no? Surely, the ""solution"" is not to lower the public's reasonable expectation that packages be delivered in a reasonable time frame?"
"all I see in that article is exploitation of elderly workers (never even keep up with inflation) and process inefficiencies. are they going to try to humanise and pull at heartstrings again (just like the mrt)? because no sympathies here. Singapore deserves a fine, a much larger one."
"Ya. Every time I see how nice the Post Office Centre is, first thing comes my mind: Isn't SingPost struggling and its employees are not well-paid? How SingPost afford to build such nice offices without undercutting low-level workers who are backbone of their company and enrich those sitting on ivory tower."
seems like things just got worse after privatisation eh
Profits is soaring though: https://www.singpost.com/about-us/news-releases/singpost-third-quarter-net-profit-rises-156-cent-s502-million
Singpost's annual report is an interesting read for anyone interested. Senior management pulling in 500k to 1.5m a year. Board directors get around 100k to 150k for attending a few meetings a year. Then there's the postman who makes less than 30k a year working 12 hour days.Last year's annual report (go to pg 52): https://www.singpost.com/sites/default/files/b2c_financial_news_files/2018/06/ann201806181.pdfBoard of directors:https://www.singpost.com/about-us/corporate-info/board-directorsEdit:Corrected the page number.
"At first, I’d wanted to ignore this obvious crisis management PR piece with a sensational truth-fudging headline because its aims are obvious, but it is working on some people. It is obviously trying to smooth over the justified anger and disappointment of the people who finally stood up to seek accountability after having had their personal mail dumped or undelivered, paid corporate advertisements trashed, lied to by SP staff and having their illegal dumping activities covered up and excused away or just basically ignored.First, let’s look at the headline. Two slices of bread and one toilet break in a 12-hour work shift? Right. Is this the journalistic set up for a heartbreaking article on slavery and torture in the Middle East? Isn’t this a sensationalist headline for a SP employee for the one day of a scheduled interview? Please prove how that is nutritionally and physiologically possible with the subject being physically able to do a manual job for decades. (Also, has anyone tried urinating only once in 12 hours?)Subject of interview and photoshoot of a “regular”meetingis this a reflection of a true cross section of the make up of the employees whom the readers have had the misfortune of witnessing being involved in mail tampering or being brushed away on the phone when reporting? The readers will obviously have their heartstrings be pulled if you’re going to put one of your oldest Singaporean employee - an elderly 65-year-old abang with injuries upfront and centre as main subject and have all subjects in the meeting being depicted as our fellow abangs.“It remains a tough - if not even tougher - slog, given the drastically changed nature of mail delivery, as Singaporeans fall in love with the convenience of online shopping.”Singaporeans make it a tougher slog (hence the mail dumping) for SP employees by buying, contributing to the economy and increasing the profit margins of Singpost.E-commerce is such a new thing that SP hasn’t found the time in decades to manage human resources and pegging salaries to inflation and cost of living.“Contrary to the perception that postmen prefer to just leave a failed delivery notice at the door and scoot off quickly...”ST says to check your perception, people.“After working for 43 years, Mr Rajab's basic salary is about $1,800.” “It is a big jump from the $300 he earned when starting out in 1976...”“a big jump”... I don’t know what you are smoking and have you heard of inflation?$1.8k after working for 43 years in SP - who’s objecting to minimum wage in this case again?“SingPost says its entry-level full-time postmen draw a basic salary of $1,600 a month.”There’s not much salary progression it seems.“He then joined SingPost, going for a stable job with medical and other benefits.”Underpaid positions but it is still stable, people!“His wife is a housewife, and they have three children.”A stable, meagre salary which can feed five! Let’s not forget that two slices of bread in 12 hours.Top journalistic points for the failure to mention the third quarter net profit of SP rising 15.6% to $50.2 million. Dumping of mail is also illegal.This is why I rather pay for real news. Read critically."
"“Contrary to the perception that postmen prefer to just leave a failed delivery notice at the door and scoot off quickly...”ST says to check your perception, people.From the description of their app, it seems that a postman can easily circumvent the 45s waiting time by starting the timer when they are still on their way to a house."
You are absolutely right!
"urinating only once in 12 hoursIt's possible. Even though I work outdoors and drink a lot of water, I sweat most of it away. I pee once in the morning when I wake up. And only get the urge to pee again when I reach home at night."
so now singpost is self victimizing
"This really gives an additional angle to the earlier article about them failing to meet their service standards, they're already pushed to the limit just to meet their quotas."
"First thing that comes to my mind is, why one earth is SingPost not hiring more postman?Number of mail being delivered has increased from the past and will continue to increase in the future.You have that one postman working 12hrs a day, eating that kind of food, without any time for proper rest during his work. I mean seriously...It just paints SingPost as an exploitative company that's just out to make money. And the only reason I can think of not hiring more postman is because each new hire means extra cost which means the management people will have less salary for themselves.Greedy, shameless and unprofessional. That's no way to run a company.You mean that's the standard of a Singapore company? So low?"
"clearly like a lot of businesses, Singpost is understaffed.but rent is expensive.but paying salaries is expensive.but unemployment rate is at 2%but foreign manpower is seen as undesirable.eventually, something has to give.wonder what it would be."
Garnering sympathy with stories like this is their first step to justify a rate hike.
Idea: POPstations in every few HDB block. Packages and registered mails go into the POPstations. A slip with passcode and instructions on how to collect goes into the letterbox. Scan IC and key in passcode to unlock the popstation.
Passcode and instructions can be sent to a recipient's phone.
"I don't want to be overly harsh, but this is an idea which is really poorly thought out.Door to door mail (which is the type of mail cited in this article) in fact is typically Registered mail, used for important documents. This mail requires a signature or acknowledgement or it will be returned to the sender. It can't be left in the postbox for various reasons, namely due to the urgency of the mail.As also cited in the article, postboxes are already being overfilled. Without a doubt, I'm very sure the POPstation will become overfilled within a few weeks. POPstations are shared between multiple users and people now already don't usually check their mailbox daily, much less with a less convenient POPstation. It's going to become full, fast.There's a lot more that makes this idea unviable. A more practical solution is to increase the recruiting salary of postmen. The current staff suffer less from inflation and more staff join SingPost (due to the increased salary) to share the burden. This will of course cause an increase in the cost of the service, but its inevitably unavoidable in the long run."
"Or learn from Taiwan, nearest 7-11 is your bulk post collection point."
I miss this so much. I receive a sms that it's ready for collection at the 7-11 I choose and I can collect when I'm free. But I've never had to collect registered mail before; that might not work.
"Opening a pop station can serve as an acknowledgement.The number of pop stations have to be increased. Uncollected parcels within a certain time frame will be return.China has something similar. As far as I know, they work great."
"Thanks for your comments. There was zero thought put into this as it took only 30 secs from my brainfart idea forming in my head to typing it out and hitting the reply button. But I would like to address some of your points which not not been addressed by others.The POPstation acts as an electronic extension of the post office, safegaurding the article. The advantage to the receipant is that they can retrieve the article on the same day, instead of going to the PO the next day or arranging for redelivery.Even if the postman chaokeng and put all his deliveries into a POPstation, this is not as much of an inconvenience as the aforementioned alternativesPeople who don't check their mailbox regularly should not complain about not receiving an article. Singpost is the budget airline of courier services; customers can expect to do some of their own work.Throwing manpower at a problem is not ideal, especially in manpower-starved Singapore. Increasing productivity with technology and process re-engineering should be what we look at firstMy gut feel is that process and procedures for the normal beat postman has not changed to keep up with the increase in volume of door knocking required."
"Provide much larger mailboxes la, see how much wasted space are in Void Decks. No need to send to door for bulky items, only registered and proof of signature items. Waiting for the damn lift is more than 2 mins sometimes.I’d go even further to say that with their app they can just scan the registered article and take a picture of it in the mailbox. Anything more important or urgent can be sent by a real courier or SpeedPost.Up the postmen pay also la, SingPost management dickheads. Dowan also can but all managers above need to deliver mail 2 days a week. CEO 3 days."
is there no union to represent their views
NTUC?
you forgot the /s
? We got union meh?Why you mention insurance company / super market?
"There are no fixed hours: a postman has to deliver his mail load for the day, which varies, before he can knock off. Each usually delivers mail to some 20 blocks in an area.Fuck man, feelsbad. No wonder you have postmen that just knock once and fuck off quick. Because who doesn't want to pangkang?There has to be a better way to do it lah. Maybe a batch of teen part timers coordinated by a full timer for a specific set of X blocks of HDBs, split the load for the full timer. I remember turning 16 and having no idea where to get jobs, and I wouldn't have minded doing something like this."
It is always the lowest lifeform the one to be sacrificed.Coincidentally also the one who does the most amount of shit.Maybe that's how life works for those not being academically good
"Just trying to gain sympathy. I’ve had it with SINPOST. This problem of non-delivery has been on going for years!! The postman in my area is too lazy to even lift up his finger to press the doorbell!!! You can tell me how sad and pathetic a life the postmen could lead. This is not going to sway me. Look, you have a job to do, just do it. Not enough pay? Working long hours? Man, should we the consumers bear the brunt of how unfair life is treating you? I do believe this article is but a PR stunt!! You don’t deserve my sympathy!"

I thought the max number of hours of work is around 9 to 10 hours tops according to the law. Anyone knows more?
"No. An employee cannot be contracted to work more then 8 hours a day if they are required to the hours exceeding should be paid to them at 1.5 times their hourly basic. Max is 12 hours a day and you are not allowed to exceed 72 hours of overtime a month. Of course, this timing and all is for most general jobs.Other jobs like for example those in the checkpoints or airports might not 100% follow this due to operations running 24hrs,protecting the borders or lack of manpower. Well that was how it was like for us when I was working in the airport. Our management did do a lot of things to reduce the OT hours and all but its hard. Reduce OT hours, people are unhappy cause they work and earn less, keep it the same, people complain that there's too much OT.Edited: I meant if you keep it the same people are unhappy about having too much OT haha"

"Why whiskey was the last thing on RSN submarine commander's mind during gruelling 'Perisher' courseSINGAPORE - While Senior Lieutenant-Colonel Loh Mun Heng is fond of whiskey, he was determined not to receive a bottle of it during the six-month-long ""Perisher"" submarine command course he attended in 2007.That is because trainees who fail the course - including those who choose to give up at any point - are given a customary farewell of a bottle of whiskey to drown their sorrows on board the ferry back to shore, said STLC Loh in an e-mail interview on Thursday (Feb 14).""I was determined not to receive that farewell. It dawned upon me that the submariner's competency and character are key to the submarine's mission success,"" he said.SLTC Loh, 46, shared his experiences with Singapore media ahead of the launch of the Republic of Singapore Navy's (RSN's) first newly built submarine, the Type 218SG, by Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen in the city of Kiel in Germany on Monday (Feb 18).He was the second of two officers from the RSN who have been sent to the Royal Netherlands Navy Submarine Command Course so far, which trains submariners to become commanding officers.Both passed the course, which is known for its high failure rate of more than 50 per cent. The RSN is the first Asian navy who have sent personnel that have passed.SLTC Loh said that throughout the course, he was stress-tested to his limits, especially mentally.Related Story A rare look at RSN submarine training: Crew can now take out adversary within minutesRelated Story Singapore Navy's first new Type 218SG submarine to be launched in Germany on Monday""But I persevered and overcame the difficulties because I knew I was carrying the reputation of our submarine force on my shoulders,"" said the former commanding officer of the Archer-class submarine RSS Swordsman from 2008 to 2016.The final phase of the course was a month-long sea exercise on board the Dutch submarine Walrus, he said, where trainees are assessed on their tactical competencies in leading the ship to perform navigation and intelligence operations.This was done in the presence of opposing forces such as frigates, helicopters and maritime patrol aircraft.""We had to navigate the shallow waters safely around the Scottish island of Arran without GPS. In addition, we had to evade and remain undetected by the exercise opposition, who were given an approximate time and area where the Walrus would be,"" he said.SLTC Loh, as chief trainer of the RSN's submarine force, is responsible for the training system to ensure there is sufficient numbers of well-trained submariners.He has adapted aspects from his experience in the Perisher course to the RSN's training system, with local qualification courses redesigned to teach beyond technical skills, to develop skills such as mental agility, situational awareness and command presence.""To me, the term 'Perisher' is more than a gruelling course. It is an attitude, a spirit, if you will.""0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

"you can thank them for their time interviewing you, and say you hope to hear from them soon. makes a good impression imosource: currently doing hr work"
"Yep that was what I had in mind , to leave an impression . But do you think if an intern were to send a thank you note , its ok ? Or does it make him despo for the position?"
"No la, just give a short thank you note, they will probably appreciate it. Don’t think too much into it :)"
hahaha okie !!! Tysm for ur input :-)
"Good to leave an impression but honestly unless you have some personal code of conduct to follow or you really really really want the job and also hope to see yourself be there long term, not necessary la"

"Being a pushover, I agreed to meet a friend who's an insurance agent to talk about insurance. Doubt it'll just be a talk. And I find it nearly impossible to say no, especially in person. Help what to do I don't want insurance"
Learn to say no. Learn to say no! It'll save you from even worse headaches in the future!
"Don't sign anything on the first meet, but get as much info as you can to consult your parents or friends who may know more about what to look for and what you need. To make the meeting useful, find out what you are covered; your parents may have bought some for you.There's a certain level of distrust on this sub about insurance, but it's usually a very important product that gives you certainty in your financial planning; agents aren't kidding when they say a bad illness could wipe out your savings and more, and you don't want to keep so much savings anyway due to inflation.Something very important to note however: the same friend may switch portfolios or jump to other companies, which means that the policies you buy may be handed to someone else to manage. So never sign policies with a person just because they are friends. Sign only because they are good for you."
Be a good friend and tell him/her to get a real job.
"Whatever you do, don't go.If lying is too much for you. Then Just purposely book an appt with your friend, dentist, mother, father or for grooming on the same day and tell your friend that you forgot you double booked and will meet him / her some other day.I personally find family matters a good excuse to use when I was like you back then.

Be honest with your friend.
Think of it as doing right by your friend.Don't waste your friend's time if you are really not interested in buying insurance from him.
keep questioning everything down to the last detail
sign first then use the 14 day free look to cancel
"On that day, text him, ""Brah... not feeling well. Meet you another time ok?"""
You can grill him/her on the insurance products. Say if you don't understand the full product then you are not comfortable with purchasing it. Then keep asking 'why like this arh' when they introduce a new feature.
Cancel on your friend altogether. Are y'all close?

"Those 'new' displays showing the current destination on train carriages are absolutely horrendous.It's either too small to see anything from a distance, too zoomed in and thus omitting certain stations, or showing downright pointless pictures taken by what seems like amateur photographers of what's supposed to be landmarks around the station the train is stopping at?Who green lit this sia srsly.

"Aye, about to leave my job already, then I heard bad news about my assistant manager, that he’s to be terminated if he fails to produce something by Friday.Thing is, he’s treated rather unfairly, imo, but at the same time, he’s... rash and obstinate. Difficult to work with, without quarrelling on my side. Still, I wouldn’t wish to be treated the way he is, right now, by the higher management.I don’t like him, hell, I dislike him because of his behaviour, but before I leave, I’d at least do something to prevent his demise. Perhaps, one last miracle, before I leave bah. It’s something I should think about and plan."
"So, let me get this right.Your manager is difficult to work with.Quarrels with you.Has some negative traits that aren't great for work in general.And you still want to do something for him? o_O"
"Yup, sounds about right. If I’m leaving, might as well use what time I have left in the company to help someone out bah."
You're a much better person than I am in that situation.
Why are you making his problems your problems?

"Where can i change AUD in SG at good exchange rates?For instance if i am changing 10k SGD, how much can i ‘bargain’ for the exchange rate to be better? etc a margin of 0.1,0.2 ...."
I did it before and I believed I did get better rates due to large amount of currency (>100K). No harm in asking though.
"I don’t think there’s really a bargain/better rate, after so many years of me changing large amounts of currency.You can check out cashchanger.co"
Hey thanks so much. So it is unlikely to negotiate for a better rate after all?
You can try and see if it works .... but I’ve never tried that before. Let me know if it works!! Haha

"Operating makeshift ""jungle brothels"" and illegal dumping are among the illicit activities that have been carried out by trespassers on state land.However, resource constraints mean that the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) is not always able to effectively conduct surveillance for such activities around the clock.It is one of three government agencies calling for teams in Singapore and beyond to come up with technological solutions for such problems through a new open-ended procurement process led by the Government Technology Agency (GovTech), the agency behind public sector tech transformations.Under the InnoLeap Call for Solutions scheme, groups from Singapore or overseas with relevant industry knowledge - including start-ups, academia and researchers - can come up with proposals for problems faced by government agencies.Proposals that are awarded contracts can potentially move through the different stages of the project - such as proof of concept, pilot and deployment - without additional tender exercises, subject to an evaluation at each stage.The agency is also able to refine its requirements at each stage.Looking for tech supportTwo agencies seeking solutions:Automated detection of illegal activities on state lands (Singapore Land Authority)The SLA wants to tackle illegal activities (such as illegal dumping, squatting and vice activities) on state land.It is exploring surveillance technology so that the agency and its security contractors can react quickly to ground situations at all times.Currently, patrols are carried out by security contractors on a weekly basis, while members of the public can also provide feedback.The proposed solution must be able to operate under constraints such as the lack of a direct power source and dense vegetation.Making better decisions with accurate identification of precedent cases ( Supreme Court, on behalf of the Singapore judiciary)Judges decide on damages for personal injury cases by taking into consideration previous similar decisions.The Supreme Court is looking for a solution to support efficient and effective search and retrieval of relevant legal cases and information, including by those who are not legally trained.Currently, the compilation of previous cases is done manually and is tedious and inefficient.For example, decisions are manually curated and compiled into a hard copy that is generated periodically - a labour-intensive process.Judges spend a substantial amount of time manually summarising cases to fit them within a pre-determined ""template"" so that these cases can be properly indexed.Yuen SinGovernance expert Neo Boon Siong of Nanyang Technological University said this open innovation approach, which has already been adopted by companies such as DBS Bank, is a departure from the usual procurement process.Typically, agencies define the solution or service they require before calling a tender to get interested suppliers to bid based on the requirements specified, he said.""Often, you do not know if a solution is effective until you work with the agency and stakeholders in the specific context,"" he said. ""In a sense, (this model) allows companies and organisations to jointly pilot, experiment and fine-tune their solutions, and learn from each other in the process.""He added that the scope for such projects can be broadened to tackle more complex and ambiguous problems such as income inequality.There are also lower barriers to entry under the InnoLeap scheme. While the open tender process conducted on government procurement portal GeBiz requires businesses to be registered as government suppliers, the InnoLeap scheme allows anyone with a good proposal to submit it on the GovTech crowdsourcing website at ideas.gov.sg""The aim is to accelerate the public sector's innovation journey to transform public service delivery through collaboration and co-creation with industry,"" said a GovTech spokesman.Last August, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung, who was previously Minister-in-charge of Public Service Innovation, announced that the Government would adopt more outcome-based procurement, where tenderers propose the solutions to achieve the desired outcomes, rather than just meeting the Government's specifications.MORE COLLABORATIONIt seems interesting that we can work directly with the agency and get a sense of the crucial areas of their operations where we can innovate. I hope this whole process will be faster than an open tender.MR VITALIY NECHAEV, founder of virtual reality and 360 video production studio Vostok VR.GovTech will hold a sharing session on Feb 25, when interested project teams can hear various agencies' problem statements. March 15 is the deadline for proposal submission.Mr Vitaliy Nechaev, 32, founder of virtual reality and 360 video production studio Vostok VR, is interested in submitting a proposal in response to SLA's call for a solution to visualise land boundaries.He said: ""It seems interesting that we can work directly with the agency and get a sense of the crucial areas of its operations where we can innovate.

"I have tried searching but there wasn't any specific answer I can derive.So, 发糕 in Chinese. Mostly used for praying days and religious occasion, but are they safe to eat? Usually bakeries sell them as well. For the ingredients used, I heard before that they added a lot of yeast or something to make it 发 (blossom) where the actual raw ingredients used are very little so is not good for consumption. Is this true?Let's share your opinion/thoughts/experience and knowledge if any!"
"Yes, you can eat them.I are them as a kid. They're just ordinary cakes that's steamed instead of baked."
"I think it's like the ""Wa Ko Kueh"" that's made by steaming. But I almost haven't seen these Huat Kuehs selling the same way. Did you get yours from the bakeries or some specialised stall selling them?"
I’ve seen pigeons/mynahs “fighting over” that kueh. Our city is not littered with dead birds. So i guess it’s safe for consumption.
hahaha
Yeah you can eat them
Great! So I can :D
A lot of good places selling fresh huat kueh
"Haha I guess there is, but not a lot in my experience. The ones I mostly came across are from the bakeries ready-made, and I can see majority are from suppliers who made them in their factories.Got any place good enough you like to recommend?"
Ji Xiang at Everton park. The famous Ang Ku kueh place. they do very good huat kueh
Oh yesssss. With the orange sugar!
"Wow~ I never envision this pairing but it's what I would do for its similar counterpart ""Wa Ko Kueh"" though!"
That is da bomb
"Malaysian here. Huat Kueh in Malaysia usually have 2 version (at least true at where I live), for human consumption and for spirit or God consumption (for religious purposes). We usually ask the vendor/seller which version that they are selling before buying it.The one for religion purposes are also safe to eat but usually doesn't taste good. I heard that the vendor/seller only focus on making the Huat Kueh ""blossom"" (Huat) beautifully without any concern for the taste."
"Thanks for chiming in! Appreciated your sharing and in fact, what you have said totally reflected my original sentiments with regards to the consumption of our Huat Kuehs. I always felt that there must be something different in their way of making these Kuehs that most of our elders shun from eating them as much.Next time I'll ask the vendors if I got the chance."
"My understanding is that the elders like the huat kueh because it’s an “blessed” food item if the prayer area is only temporary, like the grave stone of the dead family member. (Aka pray finish and go) if it’s a permanent spot like for home, they will just leave it there as offerings till it turn moldy."
This guy huats
It's safe. Used to eat the orange ones for breakfast.
"idk, one of my relatives loves eating them but they are not dead yet so ig yes"
"Eat already very ""huat"" one"
"It's supposed to be eaten!!Just that maybe some people might not want to eat it depending on what kind of prayers its used for (deity / deceased relatives / ""good brothers"") because of superstition."
Yup. And I absolutely love them
yea you can eat them. Best will be slicing them up and frying them in butter.
"This one time when I was drinking at a friend's house, we got hungry but there was nothing because he'd just moved in.And this was the newer parts of Punggol (with nearly nothing built yet, not even 7-11s).Ended up eating Huat Kueh while doing shots."
"Ya, you can. If I remember, it is for some praying ceremony, but you can still eat them.Just pair them with the orange sugar"
My mum says can eat. She just says thank you then gives it to us to eat....mainly nian gao. But fa gao also the same.
Best eaten with all the molds so u will发 ！发 ！发！HUAT AH!
"So much for his earlier protestation of innocence against the ""Lee regime"". This guy is a liar and a cheat through and through."
Guy has shown himself to be a compulsive liar previously. And it also proved that our reporters will report anything without doing a simple fact check. I'm referring to the article they did of him being a child prodigy
You mean there was a Singaporean newspaper that said he was a child prodigy?
Singaporean newspaper that said he was a child prodigy?More specifically he claimed to be the child prodigy in the interview with The New Paper.Here’s the archived asiaone source.
Lol The New PaperAs long as it wasn't ST or something similar I feel it's forgivable
He passed all the background checks with the help of his BF who’s a GP and faked his med stuff
You know he said he has this data in the fb posts?
This dude was a lecturer in TP
"“Brochez appears to have secured unauthorised possession of a copy of the list prepared for 28 March 2018 by Parkway Shenton, who is SPS’ appointed medical service provider,” SPS said.From this it seems he has up-to-date info, which post-dates 2013. This will cause a renewed sense of anxiety among those who tested positive over the past few years."
How did he get a hold of this newer info especially since his dr partner has no access to this?
I'm thinking he made a copy on some online drive or hard disk
"Yeah, but who gave him the list from 2018?"
"In his earlier Facebook post, Brochez named a prison doctor (a Parkway employee) who allegedly provided him with a list of HIV-positive inmates.This might be it. His leak has 13 names on it. It seems plausible that the prison has exactly 13 HIV-positive inmates.I still have no idea why or how the doctor would give him that list. The doctor's denial was quite credible, I thought. But given that the prison seems to have essentially confirmed the veracity of the list... Something must have transpired in that examination room."
"The doctor's denial was quite credible, I thought. But given that the prison seems to have essentially confirmed the veracity of the listAccording to TODAYonline's 13 Feb 2019 ""doctor's denial"" report & then re-emphasized again in its 17 Feb 2019 report, Dr Leong Hoe Nam (Parkway Hospitals employee) merely claimed that he ""never had a copy of the HIV registry"" & never gave Brochez ""a registry"" -- ref: the 2 reports as quoted below. To date, Dr Leong has not refuted the said 13 Feb & 17 Feb 2019 reports.It should be clear enough that: List of HIV+ Changi Prison inmates that Parkway Shenton prepared for the 28 Mar 2018 appointments ≠ Copy of HIV registry.TODAYonline (13 Feb 2019):In response, Dr Leong said that he has never had a copy of the HIV Registry. [...] “There was no way I could sneak him a SCRAP OF PAPER, let alone a registry or a thumb-drive,” he said.  TODAYonline (17 Feb 2019):In one of the posts, Brochez alleged that it was infectious disease specialist Dr Leong Hoe Nam who gave him a list of HIV-positive inmates while treating him in prison. Dr Leong then said he was shocked to learn of his allegation, and that he never had a copy of the HIV registry.2) In addition, the 28 Mar 2018 HIV+ prisoners appointment list couldn't have been extracted from the copy of the generic HIV Registry that Brochez found in 2012, after retrieving++ husband Dr Ler's work laptop/thumbdrive & running data recovery software on it.(Backstory++ : Ler's work equipment was stolen by Ler's ex who broke into Ler-Brochez's home in 2012. Shortly after, to taunt Ler-Brochez, this ex posted on Facebook some details from the HIV Registry. This triggered Brochez's long-running nag-nag-nag-nonstop email campaign to S'pore authorities since 2012 about the HIV Registry data leak.)Brochez's current copy of the HIV Registry apparently dates from 1985 to Jan 2013. There is no way that such a database can omnisciently foretell who would be incarcerated in 2018, & which of Changi Prison's HIV+ inmates were to be scheduled for the 28 Mar 2018 appointment.After Brochez's multiple emails to S'pore authorities since 2012 about the data leak by Ler's ex, Ler was eventually reassigned to another role in May 2013, upon which he no longer had any access to the HIV Registry database. So whatever Ler might know about the HIV Registry ends by 2013 Q1 at the latest -- presumably Jan 2013, as based on the copy held by Brochez.Interestingly, Dr Leong already knew beforehand (& accordingly told S'pore media on 13 Feb 2019) that the material Brochez claimed on 13 Feb 2019 to have taken out of prison back in 2018 is contained on ""a scrap of paper"" (ref: TODAYonline's 13 Feb 2019 report), or ""any kind of written material"" (ref: ST's 13 Feb 2019 report) ?None of Brochez's Facebook posts (see screenshots at bottom of Mothership's 13 Feb 2019 article) specifically mentioned ""paper"" or ""writing"" wrt the claimed HIV+ inmates list.Yahoo News Singapore (17 Feb 2019):The email was sent to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam as well as media organisations, including Yahoo News Singapore, Singapore broadsheet The Straits Times, US-based Lexington Herald Leader and Vice News, on Saturday.It contained photos of a SCRAP OF PAPER with a list of NRIC/FIN numbers of these HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)-positive individuals, including Brochez, 34, who were scheduled for a medical check-up on 28 March last year in Changi Prison Complex, said the SPS."
INTERESTING. The plot thickens!
"I'm thinking that the list (scrap of paper) didn't come from the doctor. Perhaps Brochez got it from prison staff (someone who works there has to schedule the doctor's visits) in exchange for sexual favours or something else. Maybe Brochez figured it out himself (hmm, this doctor who visits me is an expert on HIV. He also visits 12 other inmates...) or he got the other HIV+ inmates to confide in him."
The dark web? (which likely means that Parkway got hacked and they probably didn't know about it)
"It is interesting that he has a copy of the particulars of HIV positive prisoners in Changi Prison (who are treated by Parkway) during the time he was in prison, and a police report is now made by Changi Prison."
"and a police report is now made by Changi Prison.13 Feb 2019: Brochez posts on Facebook (image source) that he has a list of Changi Prison's HIV+ inmates dating to his confinement period. And that he would ""release more on this story later.""13 Feb 2019: S'pore government denies everything & insists that Brochez is a ""pathological liar"".16 Feb 2019: Brochez emails photos of the said HIV+ inmates list to Lee Hsien Loong, Shanmugam (whose Ministry of Home Affairs is in charge of both the prison & police services), Straits Times, Yahoo News S'pore, Vice News, & Lexington Herald Leader (Brochez's hometown newspaper).It's like ...Brochez: Your Smart Nation system is chronically infected by big holes.SG Gov: You're a pathological liar. [= Confucian-speake for ""Shut TFU lah. You're only a <insert lowly social status marker>. Why should we act on what you say ?""]Brochez: Here's evidence (again) of the holes ... Over to you.It seems that Brochez genuinely doesn't understand SG Gov's rigid Confucian world-order (in which hierachy reigns supreme) & its pathological ""must save face at all costs & never bow to lowly beings"" mindset."

"Mikhy Brochez disclosed list of HIV-positive people in new leak, prison service makes police reportSINGAPORE: The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) said on Sunday (Feb 17) it has made a police report over an email from Mikhy Brochez containing information of 13 HIV-positive individuals.The email contained photographs of a piece of paper which had a list of NRIC/FIN numbers of those 13 people, said SPS.AdvertisementThey included Brochez himself, as well as people who were scheduled for a medical check-up on Mar 28, 2018 in Changi Prison Complex.The email was sent on Saturday to some government authorities and media organisations, SPS added.“Brochez appears to have secured unauthorised possession of a copy of the list prepared for 28 March 2018 by Parkway Shenton, who is SPS’ appointed medical service provider,” SPS said.AdvertisementAdvertisementIt added that it is in the process of reaching out to those on the list to inform them that their information had been disclosed illegally by Brochez, the American man believed to behind the leak of data belonging to 14,200 HIV-positive people from Singapore’s HIV registry.“We have worked with MOH (Ministry of Health) to provide additional support to those who require it,” said SPS.“SPS has lodged a Police report and investigations are ongoing.”0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"
What a sociopathic Arsehole.....
"Where the hell he got the 2018 list from????While he is obviously a massive asshole,MOH and prison services needs to get their entire bloody system fixed and preferably their entire management charged! To have a 2nd leak from the same source way with an active investigation on it for years is screwed up beyond belief."
"just like how we distance ourselves from china, we should never get too cozy with america or americans. Any potential foreign agent can pull shit like this the second they get the chance, and cleaning up the mess and restoring singapore's peace will be left to us."

The producers of Billion Dollar Whale better cast Johnny Depp as Mahathir. No better person.
Yawn not this again.Ok lor we increase the price of treated water then
"Why SG should not bend over to Malaysia: Annex B bullet point 15 of the Separation Agreement, which states that both governments should guarantee and abide by the terms of the Water Agreement. If the agreement has a provision for the price of raw water to be revised but it has expired, why should we let them change the price now?If SG bends over to Malaysia on this matter, what about the other bullet points in the agreement? Will we have to let them have their way again, since we already relented once?"
"This article left out some very misleading remarks made by Mahathir to the Malaysian people.“So, for us to charge a price which was determined in 1962 to remain until, say, the year 3000, is that reasonable? I do not think it is reasonable,” he said at a press conference after launching the National Community Policy here today.He tried to use the year 3000 as a misleading context to strengthen his cause for price increase even though the water agreement ends in 2061.https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/02/17/price-of-raw-water-sold-to-spore-cant-stay-unchanged-forever-says-dr-m/Someone said that I was misleading in stating this. I think most reasonable people can see that Mahathir was trying to play with words and mislead the Malaysian people just like how the Malaysian transport minister Anthony Loke played with words to tell an exaggerated story about the Seletar ILS.Birds of same feather la."
water agreement ends in 2061Just in time Thompson Line ready!

"Just a passing thought - their reasoning is really at a very low level despite all the facts tabled out. So.... conspiracy theory: Maybe Dr M and his gang are really acting stupid to help PAP look like they are worth millions, in exchange for benefit. Hahaha.Anyway we really need to fasttrack expand our 4 taps to achieve water independence soon, then show them some serious love by still selling them water at subsidised rate as a bargaining chip for things like airspace and sea boundary, or just to shut their silly trap. I love my MY friends always hang out with them but i really dislike their current govt - their govt are still entertaining tho lol. 😁"
"Probably not la haha, they got many ministers exposed to have fake degrees or no degrees."
It's best for Singapore to get self sufficient soon. This water issue is not going to stop.
"The issue is that our population keep increasing at an alarming rate. With out current technology, we should be able to be self sufficient soon if we are not aiming for 6.9m"
How so? Its a matter of price though. Us desalinating water is very costly compared to resevoir water from malaysia. Question is how it would impact the competitiveness of singapore if an essential good like water were to cost twice what it costs now.
They need money to host F1 there
"U raise, we raise lor. I think he is indeed trying to revive every single past issue before he hands over power to Anwar"
He's trapped in the past. And whether or not he will hand over to anwar is still a question mark. Later nearing 2 years term he flip prata again.
"PUCHONG: Malaysia will continue to press Singapore for a more realistic water price based on current economic developments, says Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.Dr Mahathir said that Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah would lead the Malaysian team to re-negotiate the water price with Singapore, adding that the team would include representatives from the Johor government.He said that the current rate of three sen for every 1000 gallons is not feasible anymore. ""It is unreasonable that the rate fixed in 1926 is maintained until today. We could buy things with one sen back then,"" said Dr Mahathir.""When I was young, we could buy a few types of spices with one sen,"" he added after launching the National Community Policy on Sunday (Feb 17)."
"No problem, totally agree with Mahathir, we should revise treated water price as well"
Old man got taiji. Dw to have a good reputation and impression before he pass on. Choose to embarrass himself & his country.
"why do Malaysia need to buy treated water from us though?I mean, everyone, everywhere is improving right? It’s not like as if they lack the technology or land to develop their own water treatment center."
why cant sg just send a spy to assassinate mahatir? I'm sure with our technology it won't be too difficult to execute. he's a pain in the ass!

"Hi everyone, would just like to know your thoughts. I'm in my final year of uni and haven't been in a relationship before. Tried going on dates through dating apps and with girls I met in uni but never been successful. I realise it's quite costly too, having to spend more than $50 each time. It's not that I can't afford it, but given my 0 success rate I feel like I'm throwing money down the drain. And I find a lot of sg girls expect quite a lot of spending by their bf on them (expensive celebrations and stuff). So is it possible to be prudent with money and get a gf in sg?"
"On dating apps (mostly Tinder) in the past, the girls have a lot of choices, more so than guys. So, even after you match, even if you can click, if the experiences you offer isn't good, she can just move on to the next match. Take a look at your female friend's Tinder, and try swiping right. If she's average looking / or got good pics, the average girl will get more matches than the average guy.So, if you go for more expensive dates, you'll rack up a large dating expense quite quickly.Why not go for coffee, and just chat with each other, to see if you can click and wanna take it further in the first place? That should cost you $15-20. Alternatively, check out places like Settler's Cafe (one of my favourite places), Mind Cafe, or even Coffeemin, where you pay for ""time"" to do activities like boardgames, or other stuff. It should cost you $20-30 for two pax for about two hours. #notsponsoredThat said, I know I haven't answered your question.The answer is yes, you can be prudent with money and get a gf. You just have to find the right type of girl for that. Clubbing girl - no Hiking / Outdoors girl - most probably yes"
Agree with the point about Mind Cafe too! Relatively cheap and you get free flow drinks and snacks. But I feel it can be pretty daunting seeing so many board games to choose from.
"To me, Mind Cafe has a better location (I prefer dhoby area), while Settlers Cafe has better ambience (it's good location wise too, just opposite is the mrt entrance), just that I don't spend as much time in Clarke Quay / Chinatown area.Drinks wise, I feel that those at Mind Cafe is quite watered down. I'd rather they just serve ice water."
On dating apps (mostly Tinder) in the pastIsn't this true now as well? What changed?
"Oh, I used it in the past. Haven't logged on for a long while, so I just meant that I was on dating apps in the past."
what game to play at mind / settlers cafe for 2 pple?
"The staff there will usually recommend to you. I went to Settler's in the last week, so, the games I played were: Quoridor - simple game to move your token from one end of the board to the next, while blocking your opponent. Some puzzle (didn't get the name) - where it's like the kids toys where you have to fit patterns on a board. It's randomised, so there's a lot of variations.Typing half way, I realised I didn't get the names of the games, except quoridor. At both mind / settlers, the staff are well versed with the games they have on hand, and their recommendations are mostly good."

"I had an ex once that didn't ever reach her hand for the bill. Fortunately we didn't go to any expensive places. This one was bad, for numerous other reasons as well.I had another ex that treated me to ramen on our first date. And we always split the bill. We usually go to hawker centres/cheap cafes to eat. Hang out just walking around SG/malls/free exhibitions. This one was ok.IMO, it is better to be with someone who enjoys being with you and will stick with you throughout the tough times. It is better to have no gf than have a lousy gf. Stick to your own principles, not what society demands of you."
I feel that it is also about the quality of the conversation rather than the venue! I can have the best conversations with the right friend at hawker centres too.
Great advice. Society has expectations though... as do parents and friends. Sad reality :/
It's up to you how you behave in response to those expectations. Expectations are not orders.
You have to find a girl who doesn't mind simple stuff (small chance)
"protip: date malaysian girls :pthis is my (absolutely biased) pov, but i've always found my malaysian female friends easygoing and a lot more down to earth than my singaporean female friends on average. they're usually a lot less sheltered so they're cool with the simple stuff."
"It actually depends on person regardless of nationality/race (I'm a Malaysian myself)Some might show you want you want to see (personality, preferences, etc), but once you get to know her more or during signs of breakup, then her true color shows.True story. :/"
ymmv bro. sorry to hear it didn't work out.
Thanks. It's alright though.Took me quite some time to get mostly over with it. :D
"Especially a girl from a well to do family who still appreciates the simple stuff, that's when you know you've found a keeper."
What if she’s not a looker...
"Sure, looks may count for something, but if you're turning down someone solely due to their looks, they're probably better off without you too.*not you specifically"
"Coffee is a great way to get to know someone without too much pressure. I think you’ve implicitly mentioned you’ve gone on further dates that may warrant more money/more effort. Well, the workaround would be to simply look for budget options that display your thoughtfulness and adventurous side. Hiking, nature walks, museums, free exhibitions and talks... I could go on.That being said, it could be telling that a girl does not pay for anything even so many dates in. Something I’ve noticed men do is simply not jump for the bill when it comes. That split second is enough reaction time for the girls to get the hint and get out their wallets and pay for their own share/pay for the meal this time. And if she just looks at you blankly... well I’ve got news for ya buddy"
"Ask them out for a coffee. The most you’ll spend like $12-$14.Then if can click, you can always ask them for dinner after coffee. If not just say bye bye.If not, find some free activity la."
"I'm a girl & IMO guys shouldn't pay for girls on the first date.At that point on the first date, you two are basically strangers, and you don't owe your date anything.Sure, if you feel like you both connected really well & want to pay out of willingness and generosity, go ahead, it's your money.But it's precisely because it's YOUR money that you should only pay for the girl if you really want to, not because she's expecting you to.Besides, by paying for girls on first dates, guys are sort of perpetuating this kind of parasitic female behaviour."
But but society expects guy to pay first. Some of my girl friends said guys should pay. But they were late teens to early twenties age. Older crowd might be different?
"Might be what society expects but that doesn't not mean it is logical or should stand as a tradition.I'm 19, so I can't say it's purely about age. Perhaps your friends, being in late teens, want the guy to pay as they're not working & short on finances.It's really up to what you are comfortable with. If you are comfortable with conforming to society and paying, nothing wrong with that.But if you'd rather not pay, that's equally acceptable. There will be people out there who think like you, and the one's that don't are just not for you."
"As a girl, i usually offer to pay for the meal and if we are watching movies after the meal, i will insist on paying for the tickets. I guess it really depends on the girl as well? I know some of my friends date guys for one time and ghost them bc they wanna eat free and good food?? really messed up but oh well.....hope u meet a nice girl soonedit: get a girl who is thrifty, she won’t want u to spend any money on her, especially on unnecessary things"
Can i date u...
woah what
he said: Can i date u...
"No question mark, so no question asked."
"Otherwise, we all can go for a group dating session!"
HAHAHA A MASS DATING SESSION
You mean carbon 14?
Can I tag along? I just want the food
Another r/SG couple in the making?
AnotherWait theres others?
"Yeap. Many couples, some even hitched from meeting on reddit."
Who?
"As a girl, would you be able to provide some insight on the claim that OP said that women expect their boyfriends to splurge."
It depends on so much though. Maybe younger girls expect the guys to do that but I've also heard of older girls who have the same mentality.I usually offer to pay/go dutch unless the guy insists. Then I'll insist on paying for the next one (if there is any).
really depends on what kind of relationship you are establishing at the startmaybe u can provide some scenarios ?
Never really dated so can’t really think of one.
"Agreed! My expenses didn't increase when I started dating, nor did they increase after marriage. Shared food/rent/utilities actually help you save money."
"that’s v true! just that the amount of times u eat out when u r dating and honeymoon period is quite a lot. however, when u become lazier, u will save more money and eat at home HAHA"
"From past experience I would usually ask someone out for a “short coffee” after speaking to them on the app for a while.This way, the meeting is limited to maybe 1-2 hours at most, and we can both leave if we feel we can’t clique in real life. Coffee can be cheap too if you pick a simple cafe. And if we both are still interested in each other, things can carry on and we get a meal after together. I find this arrangement works best esp since it’s online dating. All the best!!’"
This! Ask them out for coffee so you get to know them more before you wanna invest on a more expensive date. Also if a girl doesn’t offer to pay some part of a date like buy popcorn when you got the tickets. Or movies when you paid the dinner. Next!
How do you ‘Next!’ In real life lol
Coffee can be even cheaper if you go to places like ya Kun
Hahaha. Will most girls walk off?
Probably just wont show up.
"I used to have the same thinking as you.. but after some failed dates and r/s, I have another perspective to offer. Why not better yourself financially first then look for a date? I’m not saying all girls are gold-diggers, but just think of it this way, you need to be at least financially stable to start a long-term r/s and think about settling down. If spending a couple hundred on ur gf per month sounds too much for you, I think you’re not ready yet."
Don't go for dinner. Go for coffee. :)
"sounds about right and if u think that the person is not rly the kind of person u looking for, u can just shorten ur date and leave after 1 hour"
"Yup this, especially for first blind dates."
"Sure, write on your profile that you love local food and you're looking for someone to go on a food hunt with you. Then go check out all the yummy local food!"
"Coffee is a good idea. But I recommend talking to the girl a little bit first. See if you can maintain a conversation with her. After a few days to a week, then ask her out to have coffee. If you immediately ask her for a coffee date when you guys first match it may send the wrong message. Don't be too quick. Take the chance to know her and make her feel that you want to have coffee for her. And not for the sole fact that she's a girl. Hope this makes sense.Source: Girl.Also, some girls may offer to split. I know I insisted to go dutch on my first date. I don't want to feel pressured to promise another trip. The trick here for guys is to insist twice. (Not once) If the girl rejects both offers and insist to pay then do let her."
"So many comments about going for coffee, as an inexperienced teen, do you guys literally mean coffee or like cafes that serve icecream and stuff"
"I think they mean Cafes, not $1.20 Kopi C from Hawker Unker.Source: Am a teen. Made the mistake before. She ghosted."
usually decent girls dont rly expect you to pay for the meal or whatever until you guys are together.
Really decent girls won't expect you to pay at all.
"Decent girls won't expect you to pay, but will worry if you can't afford to pay. Stability is a key factor for serious r/s."
"Why should the girl worry if she can provide for herself/her relationship? Stability can come from either side of the relationship, right?"
"Seems like a ""you"" problemStop spending so much or find a more decent partner. A gal fleecing you for 50 bucks a pop is no good gal.It's the 21st century. Ask for equal payment, negotiate cheaper outings, or no dice."
"Yes and yes.I always make it a policy to go dutch every time, and I don't expect anyone to pay for me. Boyfriend only pays for me because he insists on doing so; but I make it even by treating him back and getting gifts etc. Secretly pay him back too when he doesn't know.I think you can test waters by seeing what kind of things the girl is into. If she is super particular on (OK borderline stereotypical) makeup, eating out at certain places, shopping at certain brands... you'd kinda know."
"idk man, I think 'get a gf' is the problem.Just focus on mastering your craft and you will attract the right people."
What if my craft is at an ancient chinese board game?
Attract ancient chinese zha bor lorh
"You look for the type of girl that you need.Compete with others on your strengths. You already know that money is not one of them, don’t look at spending more as one of your tools to impress. You can always use patience, humour and compassion to attract the opposite sex.Because you know, not all ladies are that shallow. Just my 2 cents."
"For my second date with my bf we went to science center. There are places that are cool and offer free admission to singaporeans/students, so you might want to jio her for those first before deciding to go and eat together?Just my 2 cents that most dates revolve around have a meal together so having an activity centered date might be more refreshing.Edit: I realized I didn't answer your question but in my opinion, yes you can have a gf and still be prudent with money. When getting to know her learn about her financial management, and if it doesn't gel with what you expect then don't even get together because it might become a sore point. Occasions are definitely reasons to spend but you have to learn what the girl is looking for to know if she really expects something super expensive and decide yourself from there.Edit 2: Also I think girls would generally appreciate it if the guy was ""saving for the future"" if you know what I mean. That said don't be so giam because that's how my friend broke up with her ex, he wanted to save on her birthday dinner so they went across the causeway so he could save money while buying her dinner, and he didn't want to buy flowers (which she liked) because they were expensive. The point is to let her know she is loved and appreciated, so even though the money is little she would be able to tell you care for her (unless she is an entitled princess)."
"So, one rule I had when dating was that if the girl doesn't at least offer to pay, I'm not going on a second date with her, so I'll explicitly say let's split the bill at the end.It's a good filter, and I guess if you're using dating apps and going for even more dates, is necessary for your wallet too."
no right answer here. in the end you spend what you are okay with.just wanna say that you cannot hope to find the right one on first try. so no choice but to spend money on multiple first dates till then. but you can choose to go to less exp places for dates or tell your date beforehand that you wanna split the bill.for women expecting men to pay for dates. there are plenty of men willing to splurge on good looking women. so the bar is set already. why would a pretty lady wanna date you over a rich guy who buys her nice stuff? only you know the answer.of course got couple who spend little on dates. you just gotta search for those types of women.
Why do you need to spend more than $50 each time???
$25 per pax with the guy paying.Not uncommon for a decent restaurant.
I'm a grill and most of my (girl) friends and I don't spend more than $20 each time we hang out so unless your dates expect you to pay I don't think it should be too difficult to be prudent
good grill
Thx
George foreman?
usually try to do activities that are low cost/ free and cap food on normal dates at $15/ person - a lot of cafe food is actually okay priced if you do enough research
"Not all girls expect the guy to spend a lot, especially when meeting for the first time. You can also choose to go Dutch. It's perfectly OK. Go for a coffee instead of a lunch or dinner date. The museum is also a cheap outing, free for local. If you are not comfortable with the girls expecting guy to spend a lot, then that girl is probably not for you. Move on to the next one."
"Cost: timeHonesty, not being afraid to speak truthfully will help you narrow down to the girl you need."
This. Filter online then go out for a coffee.
"Thanks ah.Personally I’ve hit many rock bottom, jaded, because I did not possess the necessary knowledge and wisdom needed to attract and retain the woman I need in this lifetime.I’d recommend Dr David Tian phd, if understanding how to attract lifetime relationship (dating, commitment, marriage) is what you want, from a psychological and philosophical perspective."
Just state upfront to your potential dates you are interested in going for a coffee/specific casual dining place (Eg. Astons... it's around $8-$20 per person) and you want to go Dutch.This filters out all the girls who expect a free and expensive meal.
buy burpple beyond subscription to get 1 for 1 deals in lots of place
"Yes it is very possible. A girl that is able to see the bigger picture in not wasting unnecessary money for the expensive and societal standards nonsense, is one that is worth both of your time. Splurging once in a while for special occasion can of course take place in the future, if there's even a future!"
"If your date expects you to splurge, maybe both of your values aren’t so aligned, and should be a red light on whether it’s a relationship worth pursuing."
"I think this really depends on the girl you’re going out with. Not all girls expect fancy stuff, definitely not all girls would expect you to pay for their meals either. I’ve gone out with a number of girls from dating apps, and surprisingly NONE of them wanted me to pay for their meals, even if i paid first they would always insist on paying me back. Personally for me, these are the kind of girls that i would go for. Im in a rs now, and tbh i have never spent much since we got together. We dont get expensive gifts for each other, prefer looking for free stuff to do, hawker centre > restaurant for meals and we’re both perfectly fine and happy with that. Girls like this do exist!"
"I'm a girl and if someone asked me for dinner i'd always offer to split the bill. With my bf right now, we split the bill 50/50 most of the time. I actually treat him more than he does me because i like spending time at nice restaurants with him, and money can be a bit tight for him sometimes(student). I imagine if I was always asking the guy to pay for my meals, it would be because i wasn't interested in him for anything other than a meal ticket.Relationships aren't about buying favour with money imo. Of course, if you are the one inviting her out for a first date, it might be polite and prudent to pay. For first dates, try going to cheaper places like a nice cafe, or use discounts(like the entertainer app)."
"Much less about money, dating/relationships cost too much time imo."
"When you're starting to date, go with cheaper options -- budget cafes, hawker centers, food court.I'm not recommending hawker for the sake of it being cheap, but there can be good food found at certain places. So you gain bonus points for being a little adventurous. This is not the same as making a date for macs/BK -- that's just lazy.Save the more expensive joints for when you're sure of each other.Also, coffee for a first date is a great option because there is an unwritten time limit. Date not going anywhere after 30 minutes? You can excuse yourself because of an upcoming appointment. Having a great time during coffee? Well, then order a second cuppa or better still, proceed for lunch/dinner!Generally i don't do dinner for first dates because meals are rather long. A 30 minute coffee date versus a 1.5 hour dinner, it's up to you."
Foreigner here.I dated a girl in Singapore. we always split the bill. She also told me how Singaporean girls expect the guy to pay for everything. I really can't understand that.so you might ask them if they are ok with a split bill. I really think a girl that is independent enough to pay for what she consumes is actually worth.just another view
"Or alternatively, don’t bother or have the thought of dating until you’ve graduated and start earning money. That way, you can finance these dates. 💁🏻‍♀️"
"given my 0 success rate I feel like I'm throwing money down the drain.Do you think they should date you because you spend on them, even if the vibes just aren't right? Idk man, quite apart from the fact that these girls may not even be considering whether you're a wallet when deciding whether to continue seeing you, if you meet a girl who continues to go out with you because you're spending on her, I'm not sure that's a success."
"Do you think they should date you because you spend on them, even if the vibes just aren't right?Nowhere in his post did he appear entitled to dating girls he has spent money on. Seems more like you latching on an imaginary point just to hop on your soapbox."
Tbf OP does give off this vibe because he’s seeing spending money as “investment” for a gf.That’s just the wrong mentality. Spending money to have a good time with someone is the much more positive thinking.
Technically it's an investment. Being able to see the pragmatic side of things doesn't mean one can't see the emotional side. Not mutually exclusive.Probably only seems wrong if one has been weaned on a diet of sappy romcoms and/or Disney flicks. Not sure why you would want to moralize some stranger's social life in any case.
Moralizing? Dafuq. When did I say OP is morally wrong to think of it as an investment?All I said is his mentality will make him feel unhappy. If he sees it as spending money for good time he’ll always get positive. Unless it’s a bad date I guess.
"I met my current boyfriend on Tinder & we’ve been together for close to 2 years now. Generally, I do not like to meet up with guys who I won’t have a good connection with as like you said, a waste of time & money. So the initial conversation is really important. I believe that if I can hold a conversation with someone over text well, we wouldn’t have trouble getting along in real life.Cost wise, on the first date, don’t feel the need to splash out & woo the girl extravagantly. If you’re gonna impress her so much on the first date, imagine how much more you would need to fork out for special days like birthdays & anniversaries. Remember that she is a potential future partner than you would want to spend your good & bad days with. I like to think that your partner is also your best friend. So instead, suggest places/activities that you like. Places/activities you would wanna do with her long term. Doing so, you kinda wean off the girls who do not have the same lifestyle as you. So if your lifestyle involves eating at hawker centres, going to free exhibits at the museums or hiking, she should share some of these with you.And yes, some girls will expect you to pay while others will insist on going dutch. Hence if you cannot sustain the idea of constantly paying for your partner, tell them.The first time my boyfriend asked me out was to have lunch with him at Makisan. I liked how it was a very informal setting that allowed me to be casual with him without feeling the need to overly impress him. The second time we went out, we went to Playnation to play Overcooked & Call of Duty."
"Dates are expensive, if she agrees to a date chances are she's mildly interested in you.Or she just wanna hangout.Be clear about the date, and it's not just fren thing going on. Either party could give the wrong signals3 date rule, that was my go to practice. In about 3 dates u can roughly gauge the interest.I don't mind paying for dates but if she doesn't show an initiative to pay or even a gesture by the 3rd date its Kthxbye regardless how great she is.Personally I feel since I'm asking you out it's only natural for me to cover dinner/drinksDon't ever movie date. It's a waste of money, 2 hours on entertainment with no value for either of u.Well unless either one foots the movie bill then that's value for the non-paying side.When I say value its about getting to know each other."
"I recently went on date during which I split the cost of the meal and brought my date to a free event beside a pool.I spent $16.50 on dinner, and it was a chill date with a rooftop view and nice music.So it’s not impossible to not spend $50 on each date. Just gotta pick what you’re going to do first and then stick to that plan.Side note: I’m a woman, and while I like getting treated to free food, just like the next person, I would hate for my first date to be too expensive (and above $50 is too expensive), even if I don’t end up paying for it.Unfortunately, café food can add up to $50 for two at most places, which is why if you do go out for food, maybe something like ramen (which could cost below $15 depending on where you get it), or getting Donki sushi at half price after 9pm and sitting elsewhere to eat it would keep it below $30 (okay idk why my examples are all Jap food — I like hawker centres, but sometimes they’re too noisy for me to really talk to someone, so if I do go to a hawker centre, I always want to walk around after).Also lunch is often cheaper than dinner, so that can be considered too. Plus nowadays there’s all these other payment methods that give you cashback / discounts like:ShopBack Go (which is stackable omg and no one knows you’re using it except you so if you’re paiseh about these things, you don’t need to be),Favepay (which to me is great if you have that one go-to place you keep going to — I mean, if you have multiple first dates scheduled, they won’t know)...that one for one Burpple thing (which you have to pay a subscription for but if you’re someone who goes out to eat with friends and family as well, that could be worth it to you), just to name a few.So if you have those, that helps with keeping the cost low as well.Another way of keeping the cost low, like other people have said, could be going for free events / museum exhibitions (which are mostly free for Singaporeans). Or doing an activity together, or just walking around the city together.If a guy offers to pay (and insists on it), I usually let him pay, but I get the next thing we spend on. Eg. If he pays for food, then I get dessert / drinks at the next place. I have to admit it feels nice when you get treated to food, but even if we split the bill (which I suggest sometimes depending on what I read from the person), it’s not a dealbreaker either.But if you or your date are being too calculative or insistent on splitting the bill to the decimal point, then it kind of spoils the mood between you two, I think. A few cents difference either way is fine.If my date pays in the end, and we hit it off, I will offer and pay for the second date’s meal. To me, it’s just courtesy to do that. I wouldn’t want to always be the one paying, so why should I pin that on a guy I’m going out with? But I wouldn’t like it if someone pays, insisted on doing so, and then expects that there should be a second date even if we didn’t click.Totally agree that coffee dates are great for meeting new people you don’t know, and that no matter how much money you spend, conversation is what matters most.Splurges on your partner should be saved for someone you actually love, maybe at a restaurant you two have been dying to try, or getting a gift you know your partner has been saving up for. And even then I don’t think it’s a thing that needs to happen for every occasion. Just do it whenever you want to and can afford to.Good luck with finding love, and saving money on your dates! :)"
Just dont match with girls that love clubbing / branded goods. For sure you’d be draining cash real quick.
"Try approaching women in real life. Dating apps are garbage.For a first date go have coffee or tea. Keep it short and sweet. For dinner, go to a hawker center and have chicken rice. If she really likes you and the feeling is mutual, it doesnt matter what you spend.Don't chase gold diggers."
Get a big blanket/mat. Go parkway parade cold storage get some takeaway ready to eat salad or sushi. Bring her on a walk at East coast. . Sit down. Eat dinner. Chit chat and enjoy the breeze. I think it's both economical and nice. To get to know someone. If got budget. Buy a bottle of red or some cold beers. Get two plastic cup and share.I think no matter her profile. You may only know her after a meetup and chit chat.Good luck!!
"Let's be real. I'm not saying all girls are gold diggers but a large % of girls would consider this cheap and low class for a first date. I'd rather just meet for coffee.If you've been dating for a while, this could work. Not a good idea for a first date though imo."
"Where I am from, girls would love the guy's suggested activity and would consider a coffee date cheap.It's interesting that it is the opposite here in SG.But I agree that it is too much for a first date."
I'm sure culture and weather plays a huge part here.
Sure. To each his own.
Spent 12$ on a Rose. Heart pain sia (the rose expensive)
Roses at Cold Storage only 4.5
My ex was like that. She didn't really want me to spend much on her although I always insisted on paying. Eventually we set out a system of alternating the payments when we went out for meals. Apart from that's she's usually keen on spending her own money cause she has a job.
Expecting the guy to pay is not too far from prostitution ...
"is it possible that you date within school instead? blowing 50 bucks each time sounds unsustainableyou gotta find someone that thinks along similar lines as you regarding financial prudence, and the best way to find to find someone like that imo is looking for someone in a similar stage of life as yourselfstill got one sem left, presumably. all the best!"
"Defo possible to be prudent and with a gf hahaha. When I was with my ex, I insisted on going dutch. Or let’s say if he insists to treat me for this meal, I’ll treat him the next. So, just take it slow, you’ll find the right gf (:Side note, there are many free activities to do in SG! Like cuz I’m a cheapo, I’ll source for those free stuffs. Like some redditors mentioned, trekking, or even random events like ilight all these. All the best!"
"It shouldn't cost nore than what you're willing to giveNot sure about the expectations for expensive celebrations and stuff (if it's not your cup of tea then the girl's a no go man you'll be miserable).Ultimately, you get into a relationship with someone you can agree with on important things like spending habits while going out.It doesn't always have to be costly.It's really up to what y'all are comfortable with. Don't spend because 'oh when you date you should spend this amount' Spend because you want to :)"
"given my 0 success rate I feel like I'm throwing money down the drain.Eh this one not gambling hor. Hahaha I suggest you get to know a girl well first before you want to spend more money on her.If the girls you meet expect nice dinners and all even before knowing you, they probably just want a free yet expensive meal"
"If cost is a major concern to you, at least give the girl(s) you're talking to a rough idea of your current financial background/status before you go on your first date."
"After looking at this post, anyone know where is a good dating place in the CBD/Central area where you can get coffee with your date?"
"Met my boyf online, going about 4 years now. Our first date, Macdonalds. We bought our own meals. You don't have to go to any fancy restaurants or coffeeshops to enjoy a nice conversation with your partner/date. Key is to find the right person for that. And being on dating apps gives you alot of options. Don't insist on going dates when you are not comfortable with the person yet. Try to enjoy the time you have when talking to the person online or so, until you both feel its okay to meet. Then thats where you kinda know what kind of places she likes to go to have a conversation or meal."
"It is okay to be prudent with your money. It is your own finances. Knowing how to manage them is also part of adulting.Personally, be it dates or friends, I like to treat them to meals, so it doesn't matter to me if my date doesn't want to pay for the meal (as long as it is nothing too fancy ofc) . However, most dates I go on, the guys insist on paying even after I took out my wallet to pay or to return them the money. So, in that case, after the meal if we go for drinks or something, I'll pay for it. It feels very awkward and weird for someone you barely know to pay for everything. To me at least, especially when I know I can afford to pay for my own stuff.It really just narrows down to the kind of person you go on a date with. Most of my girlfriends are the kind who will insist on paying their own share or treating the meal. Maybe because we are mostly older now and believe in being fair to each other rather then following our traditional Asian role where 'guy pays for everything'. Also, let's be real, living in Singapore isn't exactly easy and to be in a financial crisis because of someone you don't even know you are gonna marry or be in a long term relationship with just seems irrational to me.My 2cents ;.;"
Yes and yes. But definitely your expenditure will be more than when you’re single one. For me I always split my bill with my boyf. Met him on tinder (so there might be a needle out there in the haystack for u). Previously in my single days when I meet ppl on tinder also go Dutch one. Think some ppl naturally have that kind of upbringing ba? Our first date was at Mac Donald’s which he paid for cause it’s “just macdonalds” (his words) and maybe cause he wanna leave a good impression idk? Usually it’s an understanding between us that we split the bill unless special occasions like birthdays and all. But when you’re in a relationship two ppl will go out and try more stuff naturally the spending will be higher.
"Find someone you can afford to date. $50 sounds excessive, just do dutch and do coffee. Coffee is good because you can leave if you don't feel right and nothing akward comes out of it. If you lower your standards, I am sure you can find prudent sg girls. The attractive ones are of course used to attention and being treated nicely, that's the price you pay to have an attractive one. Sure there might be prudent attractive ones but how many are there out there left?"
"Just go to a place where each person has to order their own food and pay upfront.Or u can try what one guy said to me after a meal: ""Should we split or should I pay first?"". Trick qns that I saw through immediately lol (and I was prepared to go dutch anyway so thought it was a lil sneaky)."
"Dating apps don't really work. For every date, you're paying money just to get an introduction to a random person who seems to look decent.You're better off joining activities and clubs in uni to get to know more pple. As your social circle widens, you'll have a higher chance of eventually finding a girl whose personality and values align with yours.Check out the book ""Modern romance"" by Aziz Ansari. It discusses the best ways to date in our tech era. There was a good-looking guy who only dated through apps vs an ordinary guy who dated through his social circle. The ordinary looking guy ended up with more dates than the good-looking dude."
get the right gf please. ROI should always be on your mind. make good investments bro.

"$50 for the worth of the person time. If that’s too expensive for someone time / attention, maybe you should reconsider your priorities. Unless the person you’re on a date is a nightmare, “throwing money down a drain” is a bit extreme euphemism. You are going out with a person (who has a worth) personality / preference/ aspirations, their time and attention has value.Or maybe try going Dutch? Take it as a cost to know someone and make them like you enough to want to spend more of their time with you. They too are “paying” for your time by going out on a date with you. Make them see your value or worth for a 2nd date.Also, couples from church / charities / hobbies spend their time together without spending too much"

"ArticleAccording to Teo’s lawyer, females only need to remove their breasts and womb in order for the law to recognise them as males.   However, as Teo still possesses female genitalia, his lawyer Chen Jun Liang told the court that Teo might encounter some difficulty in Changi Prison where male inmates serve out their sentence.Edit: This is to clarify why the trans male wanted to be able to go to a women's prison."
she wanted to become a man. a man he shall be treated as. don't see what's wrong or controversial.
"Even when you treat him as a male there are safety considerations that should apply to every person. It's like if you know a certain prisoner is likely to be physically assaulted due to his personality or something he did or whatever you would try not to throw him into a room with 10 other inmates with no oversight.So it's either he gets put into the male prison but subject to special considerations (e.g. letting him take showers at a time different from everyone else), or if it's deemed reasonable for him to be put into a women's prison for safety reasons I can see how that might be defensible."
"what about the safety of female prisoners if put in a female prison? it's the same thing, isolation / special considerations would certainly be in place. but I'm choosing sentencing types, (for instance no caning for females) it should be in accordance to his wishes."
"I don't get the first point.Same for the second, there's nothing in his punishment that's gender-specific like caning.Just to be clear I'm not against him being put in a male prison with maybe a bit more oversight or some special arrangements. But to me this is clearly a special enough case where the risk is directly linked with the sex of his fellow inmates. I'm not specifically saying that putting him in a female prison is for sure the right thing to do, just that it's not as simple as saying ""he wants to be a man so treat him like a man lor!!!"" For me personally it's a toss up between the two cases, that is male prison with special arrangements vs. female prison, with a slight lean towards the former."
"I might be seen as ""unethical"", but really, what can you expect in prison??? What he did was clearly a crime and he knowingly participated. Im sure all the horrible stories of abuse also act as deterrent against such criminal actions. And yet he still went ahead.If you cant do the time, dont do the crime, man"
But in this case the heightened risk is not associated with his crimeIt's the same reason why if Yee-who-must-not-be-named ever did NS or even went to jail it would probably be wise to keep him away from attention as far as possible.
"His crime is minor compared to others in prison, while having a significantly higher risk of being raped or assaulted. That's not part of the punishment. He should do the time, but there's no reason to intentionally make his punishment much worse."
"However, Teo did not remove his original female genitalia.I am legit confused now."
"He didn't get a dick I.e to say, still have original outer set of genital."
how to get a dick?
you ask nicely/s
r/suddenlygay
Can he have your dick please?

"be right back, time to have 6 inch weiner."
"Genital surgery for trans men is extremely expensive (can go up to $200k for a first-class dick, but typically at least $40-60k). Basically the more add-ons - urethral lengthening to pee standing up, add balls, add erectile capability etc, - the higher the cost. Given that trans people are also usually poor due to difficulty finding jobs, it's financially way out of reach for most people, and this guy in particular was financially in trouble hence getting into loansharking to pay off his debt.and then there are the health risks (including death) that come with the multiple major surgeries required, usually over 1-2 years.Which is why it sucks that the government now makes full genital surgery a requirement for trans people to change IC. The high cost and health risks make it virtually impossible for most trans men to get it unless they're super rich or... take loans from loansharks.This is very different for trans women, where surgery is just once-off and usually under $30k."
So is that person a he or a she? If you legally converted shouldn’t you be sentenced based on what’s your ID? You don’t get to pick your gender as and when it suits you.Good find though!
He. But he still has a pussy.
"But since he identifies as male and is recognised by the state as male, it's not as if we can sentence him to women's prison. They will put him in solitary confinement to protect him from other inmates though."
"Ya, agree with this. Put in male prison, but give him a personal cell."
"Judge temporarily sentences male transsexual to Changi Prison to serve alongside male inmatesShould a transsexual who is sentenced to jail be judged as a male or female prisoner?AdvertisementThis unique case was heard in court on February 15 when 33-year-old Jonathan Teo Jun Hao, a male transsexual was sentenced to six months jail and a S$30,000 fine for loanshark harassment.Removed female reproductive organsTeo was born a female but underwent gender-reassignment surgery in 2017 to remove his breasts and womb.However, Teo did not remove his original female genitalia. According to a Feb. 15 Lianhe Wanbao article, Teo has a short stature, short hair, and very fair skin.Teo’s Identification Card also indicates him to be male.According to Teo’s lawyer, females only need to remove their breasts and womb in order for the law to recognise them as males.However, as Teo still possesses female genitalia, his lawyer Chen Jun Liang told the court that Teo might encounter some difficulty in Changi Prison where male inmates serve out their sentence.AdvertisementInstead, Chen asked if Teo can serve out his sentence at Changi Women’s Prison (now known as Institution A4).In response, District Judge Hamidah bte Ibrahim spoke candidly that even she was unsure.Hamidah then requested for Teo’s lawyers to give her Teo’s medical records and instructed them to check with the Singapore Prison Service on where Teo should go.The court then adjourned until the afternoon.Became loanshark runner because he owed moneyIn October 2017, Teo borrowed a sum of money from loansharks. Unable to pay back on time, Teo’s debt grew to S$6,000.Since he was unable to pay back his debt, Teo agreed to be a loanshark runner. According to Lianhe Zaobao the loanshark would cancel S$300 off Teo’s debt for every debtor he harassed.Teo also helped the loanshark to conduct bank transfers on their behalf. In return, Teo would receive S$450 as weekly payment for his labour.From Dec. 2017 to April 2018, Teo harassed three debtors and transferred money on behalf of the loanshark. Teo would appear at the debtors houses and work places to catch them unawares.AdvertisementIn one case, Teo approached a 54-year-old Mr Xie at his work place. Teo demanded that Xie pay back S$3000 first and followed the latter to an ATM machine to draw the cash. Teo left after receiving the money.Because of the debt that Teo owes the loanshark, Chen asked for a jail term that does not exceed six months and a fine that does not exceed S$30,000, as well as no caning.In his defence, Chen said that Teo took on the loanshark runner job only because he owed the loanshark money. Teo did not pour paint or engage in vandalism, and did not cause any damage to property.Temporarily sent to Changi PrisonBy the afternoon of the same day, the Singapore Prison Service had not arrived at a decision, according to Lianhe Zaobao.As a result, Teo was sent temporarily to Changi Prison to serve his time until the Singapore Prison Service decides otherwise.AdvertisementTop image via Singapore Prison Service.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"
Jesus Christ. All this for $6000? This is legit sad.
the added sad irony is that he likely borrowed that money for the other surgeries in the first place.
won’t the prison separate him from the other inmates? They won’t be so stupid to let them mix I think.
hohoho u overestimate the competency

Seems like that is the only legislative change needed to make it all consistent.Male external genitalia->Male on ID->Male prisonFemale external genitalia->Female on ID->Female prison"
Many FtM and MtF people choose not to have bottom surgery (genital reconstruction) due to high costs or health concerns (increased chance of infections or your body rejecting skin grafts/transplants etc.) or just simply because they do not want to. I think FtM surgery is also much more complicated and has less of a satisfactory outcome than MtF surgery so you'll find very few FtM people who have had bottom surgery.
"I'm sure there are multiple legitimate reasons to have partial sexual reassignment. We have to address what the purpose of the male/female designation on the ID is for. Is it for gender identity purposes, or does it serve another legal role?If we just leave the ID out of it, prisoner safety and security seems to dictate that prison assignment be based on external genitalia.The answer seems to be far less clear for other cases, like caning, NS liability, etc."
"Why are people allowed to change the IC and recognition under the law without changing both internal and external genitalia?They no longer are. (It's possible they never were, but the original wording was vague enough). But this is now causing far more trouble, because there are now lots of trans people who look like and live as one sex but are legally another.This brings up issues in things like identity verification with IC, which is currently its most common use. So this repeatedly forces trans people to regularly out themselves to strangers, which can be dangerous at worst or lead to public humiliation. Or if they register for an event or service with IC, it can be difficult to prove their identity when necessary (e.g. if a bank knows a trans man as Ms Tan but he sounds like a guy, they might not believe it's him and will refuse to discuss account matters over the phone). It also worsens the ability to get a job because many companies don't want to hire trans people.That aside, genital surgery carries many potential health risks and is extremely expensive, especially for trans men - multiple surgeries are required over 1-2 years. Some trans people may be medically or financially unable to get full genital surgery (or may simply not want to, because it's a major undertaking), but have medically transitioned in other ways, like hormone replacement therapy, which make them look like others of that gender."

You haven't seen the platform 2 LRT at CCK yet. It's ALWAYS out of service.
Been experiencing it lately everyday recently ? anyone facing this as well ? I literally walked to point blank distance to one of them today and they still wouldnt fly away...
"They used to fly into my kitchen to steal my dog's food. He's old and nearly deaf but tries his best to guard his food bowl. I strung up a fake dead crow to the window grills. They laughed at my efforts and continued prancing around the kitchen shitting everywhere. Then one day, my dog got lucky and caught one of them. He killed it and left its corpse lying on the ground. I guess they realised my dog's a badass mofo because they never came back again."
Wasn’t expecting that twist in the tale.
Nice.
smh i read mynahs as minahs
Both also scared of dogs
"I once sat very still under the window doing my experimental shit, and the mynahs came.I stood up and they scrambled to fly past me to fly out the window.I smacked one of then hard as it tried to fly past me, ended up having birdshit all over my arm.For a week or two no more mynahs came. I think they can really communicate well, and maybe blacklisted my house.But then after that period of time they started coming back. Hanging CDs didn't help.Luckily I moved away alr.Ang Mo Kio and Yishun mynahs are particularly aggressive.They are really smart Birds. You need to literally throw something at them a few times before they learn that your hand-throwing gestures is legit. Or else they'd treat you as unimportant as any human.Just look at their language. Much more complex than sparrows/cros/pigeons/hornbills/macaws."
"Ang Mo Kio and Yishun mynahs are particularly aggressive.This is so damn true. There's this one particular time where i went outside to buy some food and came across 1 bird gliding across dangerously above a cat from point A to point B, while its 2 other bird friend was watching on the top of the lampost. It keep repeating this movement and honestly took me like 2 to 3 loop before i realizes what it was doing. I was so stun that all i did was quickly stand beside the cats and just glare at them. Those fucker immediately stop(Can't rmb if they stay on the lampost or run away).The cat than walk away to the inside of the hdb, while i follow behind it. The cat that keep purring, and licking my leg and eventually left afterward.Really shows that animal are so damn smart, not just mynah."
"Yeah they're damn trollDuring NS, they literally swoop onto your tray as you walk to your bench and kup food from your plate. Then because both your hands are fucking, you know, holding the damn tray? You can't do shit about it.And they learn that. They know it.Worse still is if you try to preventively chase the birds away, you get an encik that chase you away.I always still did though. until one day after outfield I came back to bird-laosai inside my beret that I had put in my bunk to dry-out.Fuckers.(A camp in yishun. I went to Kranji camp and jurong camp, gedong, selarang etc, and the mynahs there were all much more timid . Javan mynahs, not common ones.)"
what were the mynahs trying to do the cat? just teasing it or something more ;o
get some hornbills
"Occasionally I have my hot frying pan resting on the stove cooling down after I made my sunny side up, then a myna will fly in and poke the leftover egg. Saw it a couple of time, they are pretty smart animal that learn the routine."
Put myna eggs next time. That will teach them
smack them with the frying pan
Them birds would fly in through the window and shit all over the kitchen. And after a while they brought friends along. For many months I couldn't even open the window or the birds will come.So damn annoying. Tried many things. Even tried to whack them when they flew in but they came back not long after. The only thing that worked was covering 2 of my windows with chicken wire. (https://imgur.com/Fd8MLF5).No birds since. Peaceful kitchen and open windows all day and night thereafter.
"Had one that flew in a month or two ago. Didn't think it was annoying, more of cute if anything. My mother gave it some food and water and it started to warm up to her and refused to leave, so she asked me to help catch and release it outside of the window.The first time I did it, the little guy perched on the window pane and eventually flew back in through another window. Did it again and it flew around the block and came back through my door (or at least I think it's the same mynah). Third time's the charm; it never came back."
Just make sure you dont leave food / fruit lying around. If there’s no food they wont come.
No food but they just make too much noise and invite their fellow kaki and lurk around the kitchen
Lol there was once my sister had school science thingy where they had to buy mealworms and observe their metamorphosisAll gone lolAnd I have to add that we covered the small aquarium.

"HAHAHA""xiao mei, what happened to your homework?""""THE MYNAHS ATE IT"""
I think it is the season to make nests and lay eggs? They probably fly in to look for places to make their nests.

"Idk why I read that as ""Annoying meenahs that fly into your house"""
none that flies into my house but there are always a group of them minahs in the void deck below making loud noises and laughing in the wee hours
They are evolving. I for one welcome our mynah overlords.
if evolved to minah then maybe.. ish consider good..?
I'm thinking about different mynahs is it just me
mynahsi also want mynahs fly my house

"Same here, in Pasir Ris. Came in and left ""presents"" on floor, kitchen sink, etc. Tried using predator bird calls to chase them away. Worked on some, but not all."
Lol. What are these predator bird calls?
"I've tried Crows, hawk, gulls etc. Different Mynah reacted differently to each call, not really successful. If you are interested, you can download the calls from Sound Bible and play on your phone speaker when you need it. If you ever found one that works, do let me know."
This is interesting! Thanks!
Yes tbey are super cute!!
Trap them and cook them. Their meat are delicious. Yum!
Why would you open a Japanese-Italian stall at Chinatown?
"Their rent at Chinatown is $1000. If they move to Amoy it will cost 2 or 3 time more.“Once we did the calculation, the option to move to Amoy didn’t make sense anymore. Over here we have to sell 50 bowls. If we move to Amoy, and the rent is two or three times higher there, we have to sell 100 or more bowls over there,” he added.Amoy Street Food Centre also has its operational challenges. Catering mostly to only the office crowd, hawker stalls make most of their dime on weekdays and between the 11 am to 2 pm time slot. This according to Ms Gay could make it very difficult for Sutachi to work out there.“We figured out that every two minutes, we need to serve at least one dish that’s worth S$5. If we shift over there, we must sell our donburi (rice bowls) like cai png, which means that everything is pre-cooked and we just scoop and serve,” Mr Ho said."
"Japanese-italian food is a young people food. The people at Chinatown are majority aunties/uncles/elderly. Maybe only during weekends, maybe young people will go Chinatown but I don't think Chinatown is a young people's weekend go to place."
"Read the article. They considered this already and realised it wouldn't financially make sense. Because the rent there is higher. Also. they have to cater to office lunch crowd, which means they MUST sell 1 bowl every 2 minutes. But their food is more ""gourmet"" style that takes slightly longer to prepare.Catering mostly to only the office crowd, hawker stalls make most of their dime on weekdays and between the 11 am to 2 pm time slot. This according to Ms Gay could make it very difficult for Sutachi to work out there.“We figured out that every two minutes, we need to serve at least one dish that’s worth S$5. If we shift over there, we must sell our donburi (rice bowls) like cai png, which means that everything is pre-cooked and we just scoop and serve,” Mr Ho said.Also,Some friends also suggested a change of menu and focus on local food instead. While they agreed it was doable, they also recognised the stiff competition they would face.“Imagine you’re at ABC Brickworks Food Centre and you are selling Hokkien Mee. Do you think people will choose to buy from the young person to give them a chance or go directly to buy from the more established hawker?” said Mr Ho. “You might earn money when people who visit those famous, established hawkers and find that they are closed for the day. Those people will be like ‘Oh it’s closed but I still want to eat Hokkien Mee so I’m going to try it from another stall’,” said Ms Gay. "
"There are other hawker other than CBD. For example, Tampines Central where there is a good mix of office workers and residents from different age demographics."
lunch time office crowd?
"Went there last friday during lunch hour, I see mostly uncles and aunties shrugs"
"I didnt even know about this until now lor.Initally wanted to go there check it out before it close, only to see facebook that this stall has close liao"
"what a tough read to get through, you get contempt, mockery and pity at the same time across"
"The ""full salary"" bit is weird.Sure, they mean that they're not making much profits. But business owners don't ""draw salary""."
"At least they didn't make a loss, like most F&B businesses. I would say this is already one of the better case scenarios."
Best is to stick to local food when you open a hawker stall. Even Western food stalls don't get that many patrons due to the higher prices.
"i'd eat fish n chips, grilled fish chicken cutlet, chicken chop, pork chop served with baked beans and a cheap coleslaw, and fries for $4.50 / $5 / $6.50 at a hawker stall. then i'd top up $0.30 for that sweet sweet cheese fries or thai chilli sauce upgrade...i mean who wouldn't?"
Honestly very few of the new age hawkers who choose to specialize in fancy modern cuisine have succeeded. The ones who have become sustainable have stuck to local fare but aren’t famous or noteworthy.The exceptions are like noodle story at amoy. Very high quality stuff for office crowd where alternative is 10-15 dollar for average restaurant food. Many wannabe hawkers have tried and closed at maxwell and Amoy.There will be an opportunity though when the current final generation of authentic hawkers retire finally. Currently a lot of them are hanging on in their 90s! It will be a sad time for us customers when they stop work but it will mean new opportunities for young hawkers.
"but that's the thing though. it's the office crowd. good food, exceptional taste, a good margin considering how long it takes to make 1 bowl. people are queueing and lapping that up. there are also salad bowl stalls at amoy. hence there is product market fit there.by the way do you know who's at smith street? bib gourmand la mian /xlb and the soy sauce chicken rice. that place is already known for good, cheap food at low margins. poor fit for sure"
China town does have an office crowd as well though. It’s just five mins from maxwell. But I suppose the new tanjong pagar centre has a lot of competition. Tonnes of Office crowd food there.
"Sounds like a poor product/market fit. However....“Imagine you’re at ABC Brickworks Food Centre and you are selling Hokkien Mee. Do you think people will choose to buy from the young person to give them a chance or go directly to buy from the more established hawker?” said Mr Ho.... given how decidedly average food court food is, this seems to be an unlikely reason for failure. You don't need to be a destination hawker to make a living obviously.They simply chose to market against the tide by trying a product that didn't have a ready audience in a hawker centre, and to try to do it on a shoestring. You don't need 14 months to figure out this would be tough even for a large chain.There doesn't seem to have been a serious plan for success beyond just surviving."
That was exactly what I was thinking! They didn’t do enough serious target or market planning.
"I guess for most people who dine at the hawker centres, their focus is to have something that is cheap, fast and relatively good enough.It is good for them that they didn't suffer too much of a loss."
Lol at how they think not taking a “full salary” is such a big deal and worthy of mentioning. Almost every single entrepreneur forgoes a “full salary” initially. Some even go without any salary at all until the business gets profitable.
"such entitled mindset too, telling people must give them chance and support them for being young. be good at it and naturally support will come. if your food is just mediocre no one will turn up. why blame people for not giving you a chance? the chance was there in your first three months of business."
I thought the reporter did a great with details and the flow. It’s informative for those who are keen to go down this path. The couple should be applauded for sharing honestly their experience so others can learn from it.
"Weird time for this article to come out. I was thinking of giving their food a try since it reported that they would close in March, but a check on their Facebook page showed they have already closed a month ago."
"I visited a few times - I knew about it only through a Friend of a friend. Without word of mouth, i wouldn’t be able to find the place - the food complex is massive, and the storefront for this is also located in a really far out corner"
Poor things!
"Just ask yourself, do you see yourself eat cai png everyday in a hawker?Or spent $6 daily eat some other food?Naturally people that goes to hawker has a budget of $4-5.People choose to eat food that they can afford daily, so the only way to survive is at that price point, if you choose to introduce new stuff at say cai png price point, people will still rather eat cai png cus it's their comfort food."
"Personally I never spend more than $2 - $3 for lunch. Naturally good, varied and cheap food can always be found, you just have to know where to look."

"Hello guys, I have a few questions about Software Engineering job opportunities in Singapore for non-residents. The main reason to post this question here is because of contradictions between what I see online (low pay, bad work-life balance) and what I hear from friends and colleagues (great pay, decent work-life balance) who have migrated (or know someone who has!) to Singapore on work permits for developer positions.For the listed questions assume a full stack developer with a BSc in Computer Engineering with around 2-4 years of work experience.Is there a minimum salary of 5500 SGD for employees working on a work permit in Singapore?What is the average salary scale like?How easy is it to land a Software Engineer job? I know multiple people who have taken leave from work, gone to Singapore for a couple of weeks and landed jobs via interviews.What is the living cost like? Realistically how much of the salary will be spent on monthly expenses including food and accommodation?What is work-life balance like in general?What tax laws apply for employees on work permits? Assuming a gross salary of 5500 SGD, what would the take-home amount be?"
"For more detail on the “contradictions” you are hearing about, read this:http://elijames.org/the-two-tiers-of-singapores-tech-companies/"
"Is there a minimum salary of 5500 SGD for employees working on a work permit in Singapore?Minimum is 3600 SGD for professionals employment pass (EP)What is the average salary scale like?Depends on who you apply to really. The ""low pay and bad work-life balance"" is true if you work at software vendors, but the ""great pay and decent work-life balance"" is true if you work at top companies like Google.How easy is it to land a Software Engineer job? I know multiple people who have taken leave from work, gone to Singapore for a couple of weeks and landed jobs via interviews.Depends on who you apply to. Software engineer jobs are plenty in Singapore if you're not choosy.What is the living cost like? Realistically how much of the salary will be spent on monthly expenses including food and accommodation?At $5.5k a month it would probably be unrealistic to rent a whole house, so $600-$1.2k a month for a room depending on whether you're renting in a public flat or private housing. Less than $5 for a meal if you're willing to eat at hawker centres.What is work-life balance like in general?Again it depends on where you work, but in general not great. Expect at least 50 hours a week.What tax laws apply for employees on work permits? Assuming a gross salary of 5500 SGD, what would the take-home amount be?https://blog.moneysmart.sg/budgeting/expats-working-singapore-guide-income-tax-foreigners/"
"Thank you, appreciate the highly informative response! Would you say a salary range of around 5500 - 7000 SGD average for a Software Engineer with 2-4 years of experience or is that on the higher side?"
"What role and what company? If you're working in big four tech, a well-funded startup, banking or a fintech company then that kind of salary is the norm. Outside these types of companies, it's considered to be on the higher side. If your role is specialized in a skillset that's in high demand e.g. Machine Learning then of course that kind of pay is the norm as well."
"If you really come here you need to take the extremely harsh drug laws seriously. Also, no wlb unless you happen to be employed at top tier mncs."
Singapore shouldn’t be on your list if you are expecting a starting monthly pay of $5500.
Not starting. Im talking about devs with 2-4 years of experience who seem to land 5500 SGD developer positions quite easily.I'm just wondering if it is as easy as people make it out to be
"Sorry I must’ve mislooked that. Yes your friends are correct. A fresh local computing graduate can easily start at $5k. With your 4 years of experience, you can get one pretty easy. However it’s important to note that the amount you can take home living here as an FT is most likely much lesser than where you’re from (depending on where you live). Also factor in the high cost of living. It’s already high for Singaporeans even with the ample subsidies in almost everything (housing, healthcare, gym etc) You will need more than $5500/mo to justify your move."
A fresh local computing graduate can easily start at $5k.Highly unlikely from what I've heard.
Likely if you go into fintech. ex: DBS Seed Programme.
"the median for NUS grads is 4k, I wouldn't say it's easy for a fresh grad to get 5k"
Hi everyone!I have been healthy living recently and have been counting my calories. I was contemplating between Supper at Mcdonalds or Supper at my nearby Hawker centre.That's when I suddenly decided to see what sort of food would be less healthy! Here are the results I got :)Just something simple guys!https://imgur.com/a/tNRjIo7Note: This are where I got the data sources from! https://www.mcdonalds.com.sg/nutrition-calculator/ http://www.healthscreening.com.sg/food-calorie-chart/ https://www.cleo.com.sg/adulting/health/calories-popular-singaporean-foods/ http://danielfooddiary.com/2015/09/28/calories/Let me know if there is anything else you wish for me to take a look at :)
I guess i'll die then
RIP
"Well higher calories doesnt mean more unhealthy...I still need 2k calorie to survive amiright, just want something cheap to fill my stomach that also is somewhat healthy."
Yeap! That's true! This chart is just a reference for us to get a sense of how much we are consuming. :-)
I still need 2k calorie to survive amirightNot every day. Your body has a lot of stored fat that it could use. You should take a look at r/intermittentfasting
"Well, people usually eat mcspicy as a meal. If you add in medium french fries and medium ice lemon tea, that's already 1081 kcal."
Go for the water as your drink to bring it down a bit.
Coke zero is where it's at.
I can’t stand the fake cokes to be honest. I don’t drink a lot of the regular type so I’m fine having my once yearly coke and sticking to water for the rest of the time.
"I'm currently on a calorie-counting diet and I read up a bit whether or not drinking coke zero is ok for someone trying to lose weight or eating healthy.If you're trying to lose weight, drinking coke zero might not be good for burning calories. To summarise the bio of things, one factor in weight loss is low insulin levels [1], and that one of the sweeteners (acesulfame) in coke zero is known to increase insulin levels (but in rats not humans) [2].Else if you're just trying to eat more healthily, drinking coke zero to curb your sweet tooth is better than drinking coke.Personally, I limit myself to coke zero once a week, and drink kopi-o kosong/ teh-o kosong as my after meal drink. Hope this helps[1] https://medium.com/@drjasonfung/a-short-primer-on-how-to-lose-weight-what-to-eat-and-when-to-eat-9aae5ce0aa6b[2] https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/artificial-sweeteners-blood-sugar-insulin#section4"
"Artificial sweeteners have been around a long time and have been under very severe scrutiny because of the whole aversion to ""artificial"" things. The fact that the only evidence against it after all these years is a few shitty studies on rats with insane quantities shows that they have no effect."
"I'm personally more interested in the long-term behavioural effects of artificial sweeteners on consumption patterns which I feel is also relevant to a person's diet and health. If we look at meta-studies and other trials examining this relationship, I believe it's still inconclusive to say that artificial sweeteners have absolutely no effect in the long term.But if I had to take a normal coke and a coke zero then I'll go for coke zero la. Admittedly more of a pepsi black kinda guy though."
The thing is the null hypothesis should be that it's just another chemical which tastes sweet. It's only our biasedness to assign morality to nutrition which leads us to believe it has to be bad.
"There's little conclusive evidence that artificial sweeteners affect human insulin level. The only thing that suggest possible weight gain from coke zero is that it may increase your appetite which causes you to eat more but that's within your own control.In any case, water is still best because coke is bad for your teeth, whether it has calories or not."
"Just to add on, people who eats at hawker usually also order 1 canned drink or some kinda drink at roughly 100 calories.Even worse, some after eating go buy those tiger brown cheese whatever avocado salted egg bubble tea.Conclusion: calories for hawker food really isn't that far off from a meal at McDonald when including sweet drinks."
That's insane!
Biryani: 900 kcalFuck it I'm already fat anyway
Biryani or nothing!
Biryani is life.
I'm here for a good time not a long time.
that's the way to live!
"Appreciate the simple chart. Use of a common food item as base for comparison is easier for some people than purely numbers. But I have some comments.I don't think calorie count should be the only focus when it comes to deciding how healthy or bad a food is. Taking the intended effects of calories - providing enough energy. But in excess, becomes fat for storage. So this way, technically anyone can get fat by consuming low calories vegetables. Just blend them and drink them in excess. You see my point although it's exaggerated?A recommendation is to look at the macronutrient compositions as well as several micronutrients/important or significant ones. But it will get v difficult for a chart.In another suggestion, I would swap out 'how bad' to 'how much calories'. While not written on the chart, but got misled by your text."
Hello! That's true! Calorie count was chosen as it is a more accessible and simpler reference point. Macro Nutrient is definitely a better indicator of food consumption! Thanks for the feedback! :-)
It should be something more like calories divided by how much/long it satiates your hunger.
I have been healthy living recentlyI was contemplating between SupperDon't mean to trash your efforts but that seems a bit contradictory
How do they contradict each other?
food before bed. before checking up on nutrition should understand the effects of digestion (or lack thereof).
"Interesting fact, didnt know that. Been trying to get my body fat percentage down recently and maybe I'll cut down on eating supper altogether."
"If you're going to try to eat healthier, then you have to look beyond calories. Calories aren't bad, you need them to survive and function properly. Excess calories and lack of rich nourishment is what's bad for your health. And from that perspective, neither hawker food or McDonald's is a sensible resource of healthy food."
"This is a nice chart. However some food with higher calories sustain you for longer than others, especially if it's empty calories it will make you crave more and then snack more. Conversely if the food is higher in calories but contains many nutrients it will actually sustain you until the next meal. In the end it isn't just numbers.For weight loss and health looking at the bigger picture is more important. Jiayou! I'm struggling too haha."
"Of course it's not just numbers, but numbers alone are simple enough to get people into calorie counting. After that, macronutrients and satiety come into play."
I'm not saying you shouldn't count calories but it's not the only thing worth considering if you're talking about healthy lifestyle.
Chye png is depends on what u choose wad no meh?
"Think OP uses the average ba, like 2 meat 1 vege"
Looks at Nasi biryaniThis is fine...
"its good for people who are bulking up ! calories count doesnt mean much imo , its more abt the saturated fats and sodium it comes with."
The calories aren't bad for McSpicy but the sodium is one of the highest among MCD burgers and that should be the concern
Not all calories are equal!
"That's true! But to cater to a general audience, calories are a more accessible indicator as compared to the calculation of macro nutrients!"
"Well the problem with nutrition has been exactly that. People count calorific value and make unhealthy eating choices. Just like how oil, fat, egg yolk etc are demonised. The only healthy yogurt available is non-Fat but high sugar!I believe people need to be told about things to watch for that make food unhealthy like trans fat, high carbohydrate, refined sugar, refined wheat etc. People prefer regular coke over Coke Zero because that can give “cancer”. Maybe, but the 26gms of regular coke aren’t doing anyone favours. Ultimately it too leads to heart disease or cancer.Sorry, I spoilt your post but looking back at my own life and the food mistakes i made by following calories, I think people need to be made aware. A story about my personal booboo is that I used to fast one day a week and only eat fruits. And I wondered why I was gaining weight! After all aren’t fruits healthy! They only contain “natural sugar”!!"
"Is supper really necessary though? Why not just stick to breakfast, lunch and dinner?"
Late nights + supper = comfort :-)
More reason for me to eat McSpicy.Make it a Double McSpicy upsize meal. :^)
where's the chart that shows likelihood of fiery LS the next day
I feel attacked
Mclaxative.
McSpicy has a lower calorie count than cai png?
What do u think?
Reality is often disappointing
After u laosai calories count is reset
This post is brought to you by McDonald's.I'm Lovin It
Always down for a mcspicy!
Are the nutrients the same though? I get the impression that hawker food is still healthier becaus of the variety you can get
"Hi guys, I was wondering what kind of things do young people buy nowadays? I am talking about like those things you find in shops like e.g. Hako? Shops that sells pretty much small stuff that are popular with the youngsters now e.g. maybe slime , kpop stuff, earpiece, small plush animals?Basically I would like to know what stuff you all buy nowadays."
what age range dude? kids is different from teenagers
"Both 😂 sry , Kids like those in primary school. Teens like those in secondary school. poly/JC?"
"Tech stuff, like high range earphones, computer peripherals.Source: am sec 4edit: if ur buying gift for teens near my age, I think we would like some in game credits too"
Aye noted
i’m 16 and i spend most of my money in the arcade
Most of my nephews and nieces are constantly asking for Google Play cards to purchase characters/skins on Mobile Legend & Brawl StarsThe legendary Bugis and Marina Square arcades are also gone...real pity
Aye noted 😂Yea it's a shame my bugis arcade😢😢
Can't argue with that. I do that too😂😂
invest in a console or gaming PC leh.
i go arcade to play rhythm games like maimai/taiko no tatsujin and the experience isn’t the same at home
which arcades have maimai? i know the one at nex has it. used to waste half of my sec school life playing it there lol
"i play at nex most of the time but there’s some at bugis+, tiong bahru, tampines, plaza singapura and vivocity as far as i know"
noice thanksi love that game...still rmb getting blisters the first time i played bc no gloves lolol
"I’m 17 and I love saving for phone cases, Disney Princess merchandise and select T Shirts"
"Selecr T shirts like eg. FILA, Supreme?"
"No. I order my T Shirts from TeePublic because I’m after the custom designs.This is my latest order, which should arrive in about a week"
Oh icic👍
"since I don't derive utility (spark joy) from buying such frivolous things, I mainly spend on food."
"Know anyone who buys such stuff? If yes, do you know what they buy?"
hahaha are you tryna do an online business?
Well I've been told to research about it 😂
Kpop merch/albums
"Not a kid, but volunteered with some last year. They're aged 10-12 and spent most of their money on bubble tea, sour patch kids, slime, slime making stuff (foam beads, glue, glitter, etc), slow rising squishies, the arcade, kpop merch, and for some, watercolor calligraphy pens. Trends go by quickly when you're a kid so not sure if they're into the same things now."
"imoooside note isslime may not be for everyone as it had died a little since last year and ppl quitwater calligraphy is more for students too, there's always that 1 person that uses it to decorate the notes with fancy calligraphyeven bujo journal stuff alsobut differs from person to person lah"
"holy fuck guys, this is the new gen's country erasers and shit. this must be how it feels for my parents when i buy ""useless shit"" that i enjoy back when i was young.wtf is slime? and it died out alr????????? what happened to kendama and fidget spinners? oh my god"
"This.It's a squishy stretchable substance that you make by mixing craft glue, borax water, and soap together. People mix stuff into it to create new varieties - like basic slime + daiso clay = 'butter slime', or basic slime + fake snow = 'cloud slime'.It's a bitch to clean if you get it on your clothes."
"kendama and fidget spinners died too, only a few passionate ppl play it"
Ouh aye will take note of the items😂
I’m a stationery addict so I spend most of my money on pens! :)
"Maybe anime collectibles? Like figurines, posters etc. It's kind of a niche itself like kpop stuff though."
Ah I see will take note.😂
"I think nowadays kids/teen buy cigarettes, saw some Sec school YP smoking below my HDB late at night whereas some girl like to buy nose piercing etc to look like a bull :D"
Some of friends do that too😂
I’m turning 17 (male) this year and I like to splurge on new clothes and shoes. I play video games but I don’t spend money on gaming items as often. I also like spending money on alot of food :D
"Talking about me and my poly friends If they game, they'll mostly like computer accessories/parts like gpu or mechanical keyboard and also maybe steam cards if they have a decent PC already. Most of my friends and I listen to music, so earpiece / headphones are what we spend on as well. Some of my friends spent 400 dollars to get Bluetooth noise cancelling headphones. Many of them also like K-pop, and they keep buying new K-pop albums at popular. Lastly there's clothes, my friends shop for them non stop also.It'll be different for secondary school students I feel, as most teens at that time won't have a bank account/money to afford these kind of stuff constantly.If you're planning to gift for some teen, it should be better to research up first. All of the items above needs to be to the teen liking e.g. are the computer parts compatible, what kpop group he/she like, what fashion sense does he/she have"
Im sec 2 and i buy those graphite shirts cause they nice
The one thing you can't go wrong with for teenagers especially those in secondary school/JC is a good set of pens. I spent loads on pens getting through O level's. I really liked the Uniball Signo DX pens especially.
Hmm I guess pens could be smth to consider aye 😂👍
"Signo pens sucks tbh cos like when u drop them, gg liao"
Yeah HAHA half of the pens were bought to replace the ones that dropped. It's like a gamble whenever I drop them.
"Earpiece, most likely AirPods haha"
"Stationary, Video Games, earphones/headphonesToys (for kids)"
"think my last pleasure purchase was a pack of playing cardspretty niceneed to break them in though, too slipperyand kpop albums i suppose (just two though)"
"I think teens would like some Hype shit e.g. Off-White, Supreme, CDG etc ?I think...don't quote me on this lol"
F&B gift cards are a versatile option too e.g. Starbucks or koi or smth since you don't need to get smth specific but still fits the purpose and target I guess :)
Just go to those box shops / toy station and you will be able to finish your research
Spent mostly on fountain pens and magic the gathering lul
Bubble tea like me
im turning 17 and i usually spend on shoes or clothes
"I found out I only can view up to 6 months and I have to pay to view more. And it's really expensive. Like it can be up to $50 per viewing of a month.It just makes little sense to me, why should I have to pay to view my own record. Anyway, I'm not willing to pay that amount but for future, is there a way to automatically save my transaction history?I can't remember where and when but I heard you can change an account to opt into this auto saving of history. I can't seem to find it online. Is there such a thing?I know I can download it. It's just that it makes no sense that I can view my porn history years ago but I can't get my own statement from 6 months ago."
"Like what others mention. Use e-statements, you can access about 5 years data. Or just download a csv record every 6 months.Google, Facebook and your favourite porn site all market customer data as part of their core business, unlike banks. That's why they keep your records forever, which may create problems in other ways."
But e statements do not show transactions right? Only credit? Not too sure.
Basically what goes in and out of your bank account. Both directions also have.
"Charging 50$ for this is inexcusable.Having said that, banks incur an overhead to persist individual transactions over extended periods of time. Database storage doesn’t really come for cheap and that’s probably why this is a premium service."
Database storage doesn’t really come for cheapIt's so cheap it might as well be free.
""
Google drive. Religiously download the PDF and store. It's a good habit to at least give your statements a cursory glance over monthly.
Yeah I guess I will do this. .
Update passbook. Say no to digitalisation? Or screenshot everymonth?Wahh you never clear porn history one ahhh?
"I'm trying to embrace it eh. Just sell my privacy for convenience. I can't wait till I don't have to bring out my wallet anymore and go completely cashless.Wahh you never clear porn history one ahhh?If I die, help me delete can?"
Isn't there a monthly e statement? You can save the PDF somewhere.
Isn't e statements different from transaction? I checked e statements but it is far from detailed.
Stay with paper bills and scan those to gdrive if you don't need to query the individual transaction. The high charges for accessing past records is not encouraging people to go paperless.
"I prefer the old days when leaders grumbled and the people took it on the chinI prefer the old days when leaders grumbled and the people took it on the chinPeople have come to expect them to rise above bureaucracy and talk openly about its problemsThe Straits Times - 2019-02-17 - FRONT PAGE - Han Fook Kwang Editor-at-Large [email protected] The writer is also senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological University.I hope the discussion on whether the Government has become complacent will not end with Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat’s recent defence of its record.He was responding to an editorial in the Chinese-language newspaper Lianhe Zaobao which listed a distressing number of failures that had occurred in recent months which it said had eroded confidence in the public service.The F list: The cyber hacking of1.5 million medical records at SingHealth; the four NS training deaths over 17 months; the shocking unauthorised release of the identities of 14,200 HIV patients; SingPost’s deteriorating level of mail service; and frequent MRT breakdowns in the past.Zaobao asked if there was a deeper underlying cause to the incidents, and whether the people running these organisations might have become complacent.It also criticised what it saw as a tendency to punish lower-level staff whenever an incident occurred while senior management appeared to escape accountability.Zaobao’s comments are reflective of the sentiments of a fair number who worry that these recent events were symptomatic of a general decline of standards here.If not corrected, it would have grave consequences because Singapore had thrived on superior performance which made it an exceptional place in South-east Asia.It was a serious charge, one that the Government had to respond to, and it was fitting that the rejoinder came from the prime minister-designate.Mr Heng wrote: “The Zaobao editorial of Feb 1 raises serious questions that my colleagues and I will not shirk… We will not flinch from taking a hard look at ourselves each time there is a failure, and doing whatever is necessary to put things right.“But I reject the suggestion by some that the political leadership has allowed the whole system to go slack. And worse still, that we have gone soft on ourselves and the public service, failing to hold senior people accountable when things go wrong.’’He cited the Government’s commitment to tackling problems such as in improving the MRT and in strengthening Singapore’s cyber security.And he argued that there have been tragic accidents in the past too such as the Hotel New World collapse, the Sentosa cable car accident and the Jurong Shipyard Spyros explosion, but each time the Government drew lessons and put things right.It was a measured but forthright response.End of the debate?I hope not.This is an important discussion on Singapore’s future, and we should keep it going if only to better understand what it takes to keep the country exceptional.There are several issues that are worth addressing. First, to be fair to the Government, it is too sweeping to link some of these recent incidents to a general slacking in the public service.A fairer assessment should take into account its achievements as well: quality public housing now more readily available to young couples; competent healthcare (though cost is an issue); a very credible armed forces (despite those training deaths); and many other areas where the service has made a real difference to the quality of life.I also doubt that, in their daily experience with the public service, Singaporeans have found its quality consistently wanting and worse than in the past.So, why the perception that standards have slipped?I believe it is because Singaporeans are generally more sceptical of the Government’s claim about its competence and commitment than in the past.You can say you are as good as before, and perhaps you really are.But the people will believe you only if there is trust and a close bond that exist between leaders and the people.The founding generation of leaders earned it through tackling the many challenges facing a young country and delivered on their promises, making Singapore secure, providing jobs and solving basic problems in housing, education and healthcare.When there is trust, people will cut some slack over the occasional incident.But if it is lacking, every mistake will look like further confirmation that their leaders are not up to it.An important part of this trust-building is how open the Government is about discussing issues and problems that confront the country.The People’s Action Party (PAP) Government has always said it will not shirk from doing so, and I believe the current leaders embrace this approach.But I think there has been a sea change in the way both leaders and people talk about the country and its challenges.The pioneer generation of leaders, in particular founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, were highly critical of how things were done here and did not mince their words.He was famous for telling it as it was, scolding Singaporean managers for their lack of imagination, lamenting the low productivity of workers, highlighting shortcomings in the civil service, and the many areas that needed shaping up.Of course, he was that type of a leader and his straight-talking style might be ill-suited today.But the result was that the people came to expect leaders to be able to rise above the bureaucracy, to talk openly about its problems and not appear defensive.Over the years, however, as Singapore developed, the county has swung to the other extreme.Now, Singaporeans are constantly reminded how the country is the world’s best in this and that area and how well it is doing compared with others.This is fine if it truly is so and there is nothing left to improve.But, of course it isn’t. And the worse thing that can happen is if Singaporeans and their leaders believe their own propaganda.I prefer the old days when leaders grumbled and the people had to take it on the chin than what is happening today when people grumble because leaders are not doing enough grumbling.In fact, you do not need to go too far back into the early years to hear how Mr Lee responded to an incident.This was what he said in 2008 about the shocking escape from prison of the accused terrorist Mas Selamat: “I think it’s a very severe lesson of complacency that we are confident we have this man (Mas Selamat) sized up. It shows that it is a fallacy, it is stupid, to believe we are infallible.”Re-reading his quote, you wished someone would say it like he did about some of the recent incidents.I hope Singaporeans and their leaders will stop telling themselves how ahead they are of others and talk more often about how behind they are in many areas.Finally, this discussion on whether the Government has become complacent is also about Singapore’s leadership transition to the fourth generation.Behind the concern is whether the 4G leaders have what it takes to be as competent and farsighted as their predecessors.There appears to be greater uncertainty over this compared with the last two handovers.The 4G leaders will need to earn the respect and trust of Singaporeans that they are up to the task – not easy because of the high standards set by the previous generation of leaders.It calls for exceptional leadership.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

"I’m going to give it a Guess that there will be a mobile app that they will soon promote too. To for example trek you route, or have guides through the app. So instead of saying Happening, it is more of APPening?Just a Guess"
Definitely the reason why there is no H.
"or it's for everybody who could, young and old, no H limit."
And the App will likely be called “Phil the Leaf”
you are correct. sauce: friend works in nparkson another note: yayyyyy more trails!on a second note: happy cake day u/mydslrjourneys!
Can confirm * I do not work for NParks * hahahaOn another note: YUPPPP!!! More trails!On a second note: didn’t even notice that!! Thanks u/campkilometrico ☺️
I think SG National Parks must have a Leslie Knope on staff
Is this park in Eagleton?
We're definitely Eagleton at this point
I wish my office has Leslie Knopes.But I just have a bunch of Aprils which is funny on TV but having to deal with enormous bitches in real life is a pain in the ass.
"For a French speaking guy, it doesn’t matter. Both words sound same."
"One of the uses of an apostrophe is to mark an omission of letter. (like didn't and did not).The apostrophe here is marking the missing ""H"". I'm guessing this is a use of eye dialect to sound cool/attract attention."
Can't believe this is the only comment that noted the ' lol.
"Probably just an awk-chid pun, I’ll just leaf it to your imagination."
Somehow makes me think of Westlife Coast to Coast
So you can take the park connector all the way from Coney Island to Jurong Lake? Will it be a marked off road trail the whole way?
"https://www.nparks.gov.sg/c2cThe Coast-to-Coast Trail is a 36 km trail that spans across Singapore. Stretching from Jurong Lake Gardens in the west to Coney Island Park in the northeast, it will take users through a variety of parks, park connectors, nature areas, places of interest and urban spaces. Some of these include Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park in central Singapore, and Sengkang Riverside Park, in the northeast of our island.Probably not i think. Would be interested to see how they link up the lornie bits."
So it is 36km
On the map I see a larger stretch along Bukit Timah road. I hope they will actually make a nice path there. It would even be more awesome if it would be possible to also cycle the route on a proper path

It's beautiful and no I am not a Christian. It's pretty stunning I LOVE itEdit : grammar mistake
Usually Catholic Churches are quite breathtaking.
"Just asking, isit because they are richer? 🤔 I was expecting the opposite because Protestant outnumber the Catholics, no?"
"It's mainly because Catholics value the beauty of having a nice Church, which is why many famous artworks are Catholic and preserved by the Church. Protestants mainly see church more as a place for people to gather, so thus they are mostly auditoriums, movie theaters, industrial buildings, etc, which can fit more people. Some Protestants have nice churches (eg. St Andrew's Cathedral in City Hall) but most of them follow the megachurch aesthetic of auditorium with stage."
"I think that only applies to protestant churches in Singapore or in the region. In London, protestant cathedrals are absolutely stunning with rich history and culture.Keep in mind that there are different protestants. The new-age ""charismatics""/Pentecostal are mostly the ones using the auditoriums, whereas Anglicans and Methodists are different. (Wesley chapel comes to mind)"
"Anglicans only became Protestants in Queen Elizabeth (1)'s reign. They were originally Catholics that split off because her dad, Henry VIII didn't like the Pope telling him who he could marry. There is still a great emphasis on ritual in the Church of England, and veneration of Saints.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England#Separation_from_Rome"
"Wasn't it more that the Catholic Church told King Henry, no you can't divorce and remarry, then he split so he could divorce and remarry."
"Yup, but when the Anglican church first split from the Catholic Church, it did not have different doctrine besides the rejection of papal authority. Only became Protestant a few monarchs later."
"I mean by ""rejecting papal authority"" technically it's ""protesting"" it, ergo ""Protestants"""
Didn't Henry 8 kill off Anne Boleyn anyway?
"Singapore is fairly young as Christians go. Most ancient churches are really beautiful, and some of those churches are Protestant. The high church protestants (Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists, etc) generally have nicer churches, while the low church protestants (Evangelicals, Baptists, non denom, megachurches, etc) eschew spending a lot of money to make a beautiful church. So yeah there's a difference."
"Hmm the Church as a whole is indeed very very very rich: the value of the archives and art in Rome itself is basically priceless 😂 each (Arch)diocese, however, kind of just mostly funds itself. In Singapore...I don't think the Catholic church is super cash rich, though don't take my word for it 😂 What I do know is that like what other Redditors have mentioned, the Church really values the worth of beautiful places of worship."
"Isn't the Catholic Church in Singapore actually the richest church in sg? Of course it's hard to compare when the Catholics count all their 30ish parishes together as one, while other churches only have 1 location."
I think they’re asset rich because they own the land and buildings the churches sit on. But i don’t think they’re flush with cash.
"The Catholic Church is also the largest provider of healthcare, education and other social services in many countries (not sure about sg specifically), which is where much of the funds go."
Yup whatever u/caritas6 said~
"I think it goes back far into history, and is related to deep divides between the two. Protestantism was - in some ways - a response to the decadence and preeminence of the clergy in the Catholic Church. Protestantism was established under the assumption that religiosity should be primarily rooted in a personal relationship with God - so cut the ceremony, decadent decorations, gold and silver and incense, temper the role of the clergymen, and make the church a simple place for people to come together. That way people would be able to focus on their relationship with God, undistracted by earthly trinkets and whatnot. Protestantism was also built on the basis that people should be thrifty, and unextravagant when it comes to possessions - including in their churches. Those are the roots of the difference, but that’s going back an awful long way in history. Not sure how well that would apply today.Edit: grammar"
outnumber? you mean number of churches?the Catholic Church is the single largest Christian denomination by number of members...over 1.2 billion
"There's a church in serangoon, after exiting from Bartley road. Forgot the name but the interior is beautiful. Attended a wedding there once"
'very admiring' doesn't mean anything.
Wew first time seeing a catholic thing on sg sub
Looks like some Assassin's Creed First Civilization shit lol
I reckon we could upgrade the spear of leonidas here
The big churches in Singapore are all very grand. I hope that means they have a generous funding to help those less fortunate too.
"You are right and the Catholic Church (not to be confused with non-denominational churches or other denominations) helps people such as:The Poor & DestituteFamilies, Children & Youth (e.g. Boy's Town, Family Life Society)Physically & Mentally ChallengedPersons with Terminal IllnessesPersons with HIV/AIDSPrisonersMigrant WorkersFor more information and a full list, you can look at: https://www.caritas-singapore.org/catholic-welfare-services-cws/#.XGg_5clGSyU"
Or people can just donate directly to charity.
"A word of caution when “just giving to charity”. Money going to many charities will be spent differently depending on the institution. You n many cases only a fraction of the charity actually gets to the intended recipient. The justification is that salaries need to be paid for people infrastructure (e.g. social workers). The worst offenders are the ones operating overseas without any auditing of their actions by an independent body.Many religious institutions, particularly Catholic and Buddhist ones already have the people infrastructure in place and the portion of funds/donations reaching the recipients is significantly higher than the charities that “market” themselves."
"I expect donations to a hospital to be spent on doctors and nurses and donations to a school to be spent on teachers. I'm not sure why there's this persistent belief that money going to salaries is a bad thing. Imagine if I said money for education can only go towards textbooks and stationery cos these directly benefit students, but should not go towards salaries for teachers."
"The problem with donating to religious institutions is that Evangelism counts as Charity work.So you have no idea if your money is being used to treat some sick kid, or convert him to Christianity"
"Not entirely true. There are specific Catholic and Buddhist institutions that I have researched before donating money to. Their agenda have been strictly helping the marginalised in health related areas. I have even casually volunteered and was pretty surprised at the lack of religious evangelism or preaching, it was mostly about service and compassion.There is also the (Indian) Sikh community. They feed masses for free everyday. This entire operation is run by volunteers, with money going directly into buying raw ingredients. The food is only vegetarian and is prepared by volunteers. Anyone can eat there for free, no questions asked. It’s very communal and all encompassing."
"While this may be true for non-denominational churches or those of other denominations, Catholics are not focused on evangilical work. As far as I know, there are no Catholic organizations or groups for evanglisim."
"There are small groups within the catholic church here that focus on evangelism, but they are usually a parish (individual church) initiative and are almost always run by volunteer groups."
"Can be both, lol"
"Not really. If it is IPC registered, the use of the funds are audited and it is nearly impossible to reuse. In fact, I found it a bitch.Source: used to be involved in one of these church charity groups and managed money and volunteers"

"""”feeling like I was in heaven... and wondering why, if Catholics got everything else wrong, as I had been taught, they got beauty so right. How could falsehood and evil be so beautiful?"" (Peter Kreeft at 12 years old on his visit to St Patrick's Cathedral.)””"
"A certain scripture mentions that humans are superior to angels. Why? Because there are people who know of evil, but do not become evil. It's different from angels, who know only of good since birth. Humans have evil, but can live as good, so they are superior to angels, who know only good."
"Amazing, amazing shot. Love the symmetry and the geometrical angles. Was this taken on a phone camera? :)"
This church's interior reminds me of that of St Mary's Cathedral in Tokyo

"For a pay packet, they risk drowning, crocodile attacks and being hit by shipsThey are in one of the world’s most dangerous occupations, but these divers want to do what they love and go to sea, as On The Red Dot discovers.SINGAPORE: Whenever Mr Terrence Lee heads off for work, his family, especially his mother, worries and prays for his safety. And for good reason too.“Every time we’re in the sea, we fight with many uncertain elements, such as underwater currents, strong winds and even heavy rain,” said the commercial diver, who does anything from underwater inspections to welding to salvage operations.AdvertisementThen there are marine creatures like jellyfish and crocodiles, as well as poor visibility conditions at times.There have been at least six commercial diving-related deaths in Singapore since 2010, according to media reports.Mr Lee himself landed up in hospital once, after he fainted as he surfaced. Yet despite the dangers and demands, it is a job he loves.AdvertisementAdvertisementMr Terrence Lee.The risky work of commercial divers like him is highlighted in a four-part series on the programme On The Red Dot. (Watch the episode here.)HE FELT A CONNECTIONSingapore has about 200 inshore commercial divers, who are certified to dive in Singapore’s waters.To work as a diver, one must be at least 18, possess a commercial diving “Fit to Dive” medical certificate and a certificate of training in commercial diving, according to the Commercial Diving Association (Singapore) website.Mr Lee, 36, was a Singapore Armed Forces regular for 10 years before he was introduced to the world of diving by his uncle, a scuba diving instructor.Recounting his first dive, he said: “The feeling was like, wow. I felt very connected, very peaceful … It was a very new environment for me: The fish swimming, the depth of the sea, the corals.”That was when he knew this was for him. But he did not make an immediate career switch owing to the risks involved and the fact that he had two children aged two and one.“I had to (decide), if I have to give up everything, whether I could sustain and provide enough for the family. It was a little bit of a struggle,” he said.Mr Lee on a boat communicating with a diver.Finally, two years later, he quit his job to focus on commercial diving.“Some of my friends might have thought that I was out of my mind, at such a late age, to transition to a new career, to do something people would avoid,” he added.His job entails him being a jack-of-all-trades: He maintains and repairs vessels, and even does construction work. “I also do underwater cleaning of vessels (and) polishing of vessel propellers,” he cited.It might seem easy … but to conduct the operation underwater is more complicated.Commercial divers also maintain the navigational buoys for vessels to manoeuvre safely into Singapore’s ports.Goods and daily necessities like food arrive on vessels that depend on the work of commercial divers. (File photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman)“Our line of work is invisible to the public. They don’t see our existence, and most people don’t really understand what we do,” said Mr Lee. “They imagine that every day, we’re swimming in beautiful water, seeing beautiful marine creatures.”HELPLESSLY ADRIFTWhen in the water, he must be mindful of the hazards around, including passing vessels, and be in good physical and mental condition.Last May, commercial diver Jake Seet went missing while conducting underwater operations for a vessel in the Western Anchorage, near Sentosa. His body was found two days later, on May 7.In June, 27-year-old Mohamed Firdaus died after he was struck by a concrete pile while working on a project in the waters off Pulau Sebarok.Pulau Sebarok, off southern Singapore. (Photo: Reuters/Tim Chong)Mr Mohd Ismail Sulong was more fortunate. In November, he became entangled in a fishing net while he was working near Pulau Tekong, and because of the currents, he drifted for more than 20km.The waters were choppy, recalled the 52-year-old, and he was fearful that a vessel would hit him. By the time he was picked up in Malaysian waters, he had swallowed too much water.He had to undergo an operation once he was back in Singapore, and until he is cleared for diving, he can do only deck work.Mr Lee with Mr Mohd Ismail Sulong, who has 15 years of commercial diving experience.Mr Lee, who bumped into Mr Ismail during a visit to a clinic for his annual check-up, pointed out: “No matter how simple (the job), we need to expect the unexpected.In this diving industry, most of the accidents occur when people don’t adhere to whatever safety (procedures) are in place, due to overconfidence or … taking shortcuts.For commercial divers, there is a code of practice set by the authorities, which diving operators must adhere to, and it includes requirements for equipment use and certifications to attain.Safety, said Mr Lee, is his main priority, and he knows there is little margin for error.“When we’re facing a situation (underwater), if certain safety procedures aren’t followed, definitely there’s no second chance,” he said. “There’s no chance for … a retake.”FAMILY SUPPORT IS IMPORTANTApart from the dangers, his hours are unpredictable. “We have to get to work at odd hours. Sometimes it can be 2am,” he said. “We have to be very flexible.”So family support is important to this father of four; they “have to understand” what his job entails.His mother, Madam Josephine Chang, still struggles to come to terms with what he does. Every time Mr Lee, a commercial diver for eight years, leaves for work, she questions him about his operation details and what time he would end.Mdm Josephine Chang.“I pray very hard for him. The children also pray very hard,” she said. “He can be at sea for maybe a couple of days and not be reachable … We (can) totally lose track of him.Many a time, (we) just hope that there’s no bad news.Tearing as she talked about the time her son was hospitalised, she said: “It was quite scary.”Despite her unease over his vocation, she acknowledged his right to make his own choices.“If they feel very happy … with what they wanted to do, I’d have no regrets for letting my children choose their own path. Even (if something) negative happens, I think that we take it (as) fate,” she said.If given a choice again, Mr Lee would still be in this profession. “Divers are a unique breed of human beings,” he said. “Some even have nearly encountered death before, but they’re still … looking (forward) to the sea every day.“We aren’t looking for any fame or recognition in this line … We’re just looking to go to work safely and to return to our families.”Watch this episode here.

Hey guysI'm planning to visit the main city of Singapore for about two weeks in September together with a friend.Is there anyone who can point me to some cool or original places to stay that I wouldn't usually find on the standard booking sites?All tips are welcome. Just starting to plan everything out!
"I think ""The Great Madras"" is pretty nice."
this
Have you been there before or do you know the owners? How long did you stay?
"Take note that we only have once city which is Singapore. There's no ""main city"" haha. It's just Singapore,Singapore. It's a city-state after all."
"Thanks for the note, haha! What I meant to say was we're planning to stay in the city center. ;)"
I think someone posted a list here recently of 52 places to visit in Singapore. Link belowhttps://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/arjfiq/52_places_to_visit_in_singapore?sort=confidenceThe post is mostly targeted at locals so perhaps you might find places which are not highly publicised on booking sites.

go upstair tell them midi keyboards are a thing
Piano? Pfft. The neighbour upstairs likes to rearrange furniture and renovate stuff at like 1130.
Mine likes to play marbles. Though I live on the 12th floor.
Hate to break it to you but it isn't your neighbors that are making those noises
I saw a few in the lifts in Marine Parade about two weeks ago already. Those were almost 100 per cent ads tho.
was there audio? it would be a huge bummer if it did

Try this nearly anywhere else in the world and they'd be smashed or stolen.
Saw some in Bukit Gombak basically blasting ads. Thank god I live in Hougang.

Do we seriously need them? What exactly are we paying the town council for? Isn’t changing ads/notices their job? Heck they are not the ones going down to replace the paper anyway.
Who’s paying for it. Surely not the residents right...
Your tax dollars do.
Ah that explains a lot

"An extract from a research by Peter K.H ChewIn general, Singaporeans seem motivated to maintain the belief that Singapore is an egalitarian and a meritocratic society. A recent survey of 2,000 Singaporeans provided some evidence for this proposition (Mathews, 2016). For example, about half (53%) believe that racism is no longer an important problem currently. This finding could be interpreted as an indicator of covert racism (i.e., modern racism; McConahay, Hardee, & Batts, 1981). However, this belief might be justified in the absence of experimental evidence of racism in Singapore. The survey also suggested that Singaporeans are reluctant to discuss racial issues.For example, about two thirds (64% to 66%) think that discussions about racial issues cause unnecessary tension. More important, about half to two thirds (46% to 70%) were not supportive of race-based information (about crime, educational performance, social problems, and so on) that could potentially reveal racial disparities. The reluctance to discuss racial issues is problematic since the identification of racial disparities is the first step towards resolution. For example, the Council of Australian Governments identified disparities between non-Indigenous and Indigenous Australians and developed a comprehensive report to resolve those disparities (Council of Australian Governments, 2007). The report contains six specific measurable goals and a list of actions to be taken in order to achieve those goals. While there have been similar efforts in Singapore (e.g., tuition subsidies to close the income gap; Lian, 2013), the effectiveness of those efforts are unclear. Also, in the absence of a comprehensive plan with specific goals, it seems likely that the racial disparities that have existed since the 1980s will continue, or even worsen, in the next Population Census in 2020 (Mutalib, 2011). The situation is exacerbated by Singaporeans’ endorsement of meritocracy, providing them with a plausible, albeit flawed, explanation for racial disparities."
"That's because Singaporeans are not taught racial acceptance, but rather subscribe to the notion of racial tolerance."
the response here is a true testimony to its results
+1 to this.
"A large part of that is because many Chinese people are immediately dismissive of things minorities say about racism they've faced. ""Be thankful it's not as bad as other countries."" ""That's not that racist."" ""I have a friend who doesn't find things like that racist at all."", etc.A good way to gauge how racist a community is not by looking at incidences of discrimination/bigotry, as after all there would always be ""bad apples"", but to look at how everyone else responds."
"For me I think Singapore faces the problem of minor racism. The term is referred as ethnocentrism or something but basically racism is a spectrum and Singapore experiences mini racism all around.To illustrate what I mean here are some phrases I've heard throughtout my life:""Careful ah, later they kidnap you""""You cannot eat pork what""""Ta men hen chou (They are very smell)""""Dam cheap one, small money also care""For me I dont mind mini racism, each culture has certain beliefs and also a tendancy to behave a certain way. If someone frowns and dislikes a certain race because of a common behaviour so be it he has his reasons as to why he doesnt like a certain ethnic group.So long as it is not outright racism and discrimination on the bad side of the racism spectrum then it is fine by me."
"Pardon my ignorance, and I am asking out of genuine curiosity, but could you explain why the second and last examples were racially offensive?While they both seem like crude ways to point out something is non-halal or calling someone a miser, I’m a little confused as to what makes them racially discriminatory. Thanks!"
These two statements are presumptions. They are typically statements made on a whim with reference to their experience of the culture and behaviour of the typical actions of said ethnic group. Harmless in nature and inoffensive but it shows to the receiving group your lack of empathy/understanding to their race.I really forgot the terms as I learnt them in a poly module but this is how I would explain it.
"Ahh okay, in that sense I understand the last one since I had previously not considered it used in the context on someone belonging to an ethnicity stereotyped as miserly. Thanks for explaining!However, I am still not tracking with regards to the pork one. With the vast majority of Malays in Singapore being Muslims (based on census data), and not consuming pork a key part of Islam, logically speaking would it not make sense for you to use that second example to point out something contains pork/is non-Halal to a Malay person? That’s why I’m still having trouble seeing it as coming from a place of racial discrimination.Again, sorry if I’m revealing my ignorance by asking this! Just want to make sure if I’ve been offending people this whole time that I stop haha."
"Yep you are completely correct that is it is logical to assume. But that is the basis of how stereotypes of any kind are formed. Stereotypes when increased in severity is racism. So minor things like these may spark racism you could say.And to answer your question, a muslim person need not choose to follow Islam completely, im sure you have seen/heard muslims at a chinese restaurant or drinking beer before."
"Thank so much for explaining! It makes sense :)I’m not sure I agree that ALL stereotypes are based in fact and certainly some are more malicious and hurtful than others. For instance, the other one about miserliness and smelling bad are negative traits and a personal attack, which can lead to social ostracization. The one about kidnapping is even worse, since it makes out a race of people to be criminally inclined, especially towards a crime as serious as kidnapping, worthy of societal suspicion.I suppose the pork one just seemed like a factual comment without any ill-will, though I am admittedly basing this on a single friend (who is Muslim and does drink) who once mentioned that the religious rule of not consuming pork almost on a league of its own and thus is very rarely breached, even as other rules more commonly are. But perhaps that was just anecdotal.Thanks again for the thorough explanation!"
"Out of curiosity, are you part of the majority or minority races?"
I am Chinese ya

"Many schools in Singapore (particularly those in secondary and tertiary educations) have been implementing a more technological way of learning, whereas information is now disseminated through social media such as WhatsApp and Telegram. Forms have to be signed through online portals and answer keys, worksheets are now only available through e-learning sites such as AskNLearn and other LMS.However, many see technology as a distraction in our education as it sways us away from learning independently. Technology also creates many distractions for us through social media and games. On the contrary, technology can also be detrimental to education in many other ways.What is the general view on this issue as Singaporeans?Clarification: this is not any of my homework assignment LOL I just dont get why schools are pushing so much on technology and then tell us not to use it so often"
"Pros: Cut down workload & improves efficiency. Assignments can be accessed 24/7 & students can learn subjects at their own pacing anywhere, anytime. Dissemination of important school info gets across better. Saves paper.Cons: Not every school will be 100% ready for a technogical transition due to limited resources, budget, etc. Having a technology club is one thing, but getting 1 school to rely on technology alone is a challenging issue. Several subjects (i.e: practical Chemistry/Physics/Art/Design & Tech/Food & Consumer Ed/Music) cannot be tested with tech & students would have to go back into a real lab for proper examination. Also not every student has the privilege to afford a computer/Internet at home - & tech can be easily exploited ""other"" purposes rather than being truly educational. (There are good students & bad students.)TL;DR: Technology is useful - it aids & facilitates learning, but a 100% total reliance on technology is not & will not be viable."
"I largely agree with your sentiment, but i shall offer a pragmatic reason for the slow transition: monetary backing.Even more despicable than the continued reliance on written paper scripts as a medium for standardised testing is the blatant neglect toward improving the approved educational tools. I'm referring to the use of graphing and scientific calculators - the former is the more egregious middle finger to the adoption of newer technologies in the way we teach and test our students. Refer to this podcast episode for a look at how US high schools and colleges still depend on graphing calculators precisely because they do not have internet and communication features. With the state of smartphones today, students can easily run graphing calculator simulations on their existing devices. Why then the need for further expenditure on this front? Because money speaks.I accept that for this to change, there should be a coincidence in the attitude toward standardised tests and the cost of prospective learning/assessment tools.Ultimately for uniform change to be made for an entire cohort's teaching methodology, the case for it must be incontrovertible. This is not the case currently."
"Before that, let me just say that general consensus is that schools including polytechnic and universities use Blackboard to facilitate education information and resources online. For ntu, this includes forum, test, lecture and tutorial notes, recorded lectures and much more.The use of technology is useful for students, especially people who stay far away from the campus to attend live lectures. Even for people who attend live lectures, recorded lectures allow us to revisit portion of the lecture that are unclear.Besides live lecture, the use of blackboard to facilitate teaching material and announcement is very efficient compared to email etc since there are always a constant spam of emails.However, there are still a handful of lecturers who wants student to attend live lecture just because they dont want to talk to the air(which means empty lecture hall). Sometimes they give students who attend live lecture hints and tips about exam, which i find it unfair since the school has been promoting elearning.Of course, some people will say they cannot concentrate if they watch at home etc etc. My opinion is that they are adults. If they choose not to study, let them be. I myself only watch recorded lectures and refuses to attend live lectures unless it is compulsory. I do attend tutorials. Does that mean i am inefficient? Probably not"
"Only if there is adequate infrastructure for the shift, and not in all cases.There is well documented evidence suggesting students learn better with pen and paper. Standardising it to be entirely e-based may hamper learning instead, although there may be a case for the benefit of teachers.My personal experience with e-learning in the past few years has not been entirely pleasant. Portals I've used don't fully support mobile platforms, often rendering some parts of a website unclickable."
seems like a greater burden of work on teachers who are already overstretched here
"Tbf some courses even with IT help you cannot get through unless you actually study through the books / notes. IT can only take you so far for such courses.Also, you can tell if someone simply get the answer from online source or actual go through the learning process. There is a gap in actual understanding / comprehension and ability to apply the concept to a different context.IT can be a great help, but easy access to answer is not actually helpful to many. Example in medicine, most people can easily find diagnosis online (which doctors do too) but it’s different as doctors have actual background and education on the matter."
No. A slight typo in your answer and you get the whole question wrong.
"Online assignments and ""e-learning"" has been pretty useless in my personal experience tbh. Alot of click click click to just get it over with. Online mcq also becomes random guessing or googling the answer most of the time.. Even writing an essay on the com is different from paper because you get to go back and add/edit stuff versus on paper where you'd have to plan the entire thing out first. At the end of the day there's just something about pen and paper that can't be replaced."
I think online lessons should be more common. Live streaming of lectures that can be view on youtube/websites.
wouldn't this mean that students will be more self-directed? what does this mean for students without the discipline and maturity to achieve this? and what level in the education system would they be finally mature?
most unis do this but i doubt kids below that level have the discipline for that sort of system
Can't seemed to access all these shopping platform at home M1 network and office Singtel network.Anyone getting the same problem?
"I'm having the same problem too, Singtel network. Windows 10 PC running Google Chrome does not allow me to access the sites, but for some reason when I switch to my phone it works fine."
M1 uses Singtel’s backbone so it could be related.Try the app instead?
I only get this when using office WiFi or when I'm on VPN.

"Hello /r/Singapore!As the title indicates I'll be coming back to Singapore for a week since I was a teenager in the 90s. I imagine things have changed since then! As a background, I am from Canada and my mom is Singaporean so I am somewhat familiar with things.Interested in what your personal top food spots are (especially Indian). Also interested in some good photography spots, if it's worth it to visit a bouldering/climbing gym (I brought my shoes), and anything you'd think would be worth checking out for someone who is in their mid-30s and into Redditor type things.Thanks!!!"
for indian food best place to eat at is little india. cos got lots of restaurants at one location. most are good.go to tekka market for street food type style food. there you can eat mee goreng or briyani or vadai etcthen to any of the big restaurants at race course road. sakunthalas gayatri etc. for a complete meal.outside little india area you can try samy's curry at dempsy.there is a good prata place at crane road. but open for very short periods of time and crowded. if you eat prata at other places make sure its not premade and just reheated for you.for photos you can try marina bay area and gardens by the bay. there is where everyone seems to go.most impt pls write follow up post about singapore in the 90s vs now when you leave. interested in your pov. cos we lived here and seen the changes slowly happen. but you compare the 2 singapores side by side.
"For Indian food, I personally like Samayal by 6ixers (https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/food/homely-banana-leaf-meals)I don't think the bouldering/climbing gyms are any special, but if you are into outdoor climbing your can check out Dairy Farm (http://www.dairyfarmsingapore.com)Sent you a PM!"
I don't think dairy farm is very safe for outdoor climbing. It used to be a quarry so there's residual stresses from all the blasting done in the past. There have been cases of rocks coming loose and falling
"hello! you’ll find that bouldering or climbing in general is quite a popular sport in singapore. there’s many gyms in the area but i’ll just name a few for you to research on!there’s onsight climbing gym, kinetics gym, boulder movement singapore, boulder world and climb central!!"
"There will be some great aesthetic opportunities down in Marina Bay, especially in Gardens by the Bay. Great food can be found at Changi Village (in my opinion). Good luck!"

"How would the investigation proceed though? How does one determine the validity of a claim regarding ""Stealthing""? I understand the need for protection for women who encounter guys who act in such a manner but how would the courts determine, fairly, that a guy accused of ""Stealthing"" had actually did it and is not being accused because of some other reason?"
"First, the highlighting of condom usage might leave the impression that the new law targets males, but as the article states, the new law applies to a) usage of sexual protection (which includes more than just condoms) and b) STDS (which females can also lie about).Second, you could make the same point about rape or sexual assault, that it’s a he said she said (one says was consensual another says not consensual). I don’t know exactly how, but unless you believe that we prosecute rape and sexual assault simply by going with either what he said or she said, I think that’s not true. Many angles can be considered in real life, to gauge each party’s statement and so on."
👏🏻thank you.also i don't care if i lose karma for saying this but men in singapore tend to worry way more about false claims than about actual assault\harrasment because somehow that is the issue plaguing us not what the law is against.
"I mean, let's not beat around the bush, Singapore law and law in general favours women, even if the written language seems fair.Also, kangaroo courts exist. While one may not eventually go behind bars, a simple accusation is damaging enough.For now, we can sit, wait, and see how this is enforced. It's too early to say."
So how many family court cases have you read before you decided taht our courts are not fair?
"If you want to begin, just look at the Women's Charter.And then I'll just paste just two links about a much more prominent problem.https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/should-more-men-be-allowed-to-seek-maintenancehttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/maintenance-for-divorced-men"
O wait hang on I'm asking you how many court decisions you've read. Since you said the court is biased.Why are you showing me newspaper articles?

"Oh look, comments completely disregarding points made in favour of an airy insult that means fuck all."

"it's gonna be a he said-she said issue so at the end of the day, it comes down to whose side is more convincing and that depends wholly on the evidence you have, the parties' states of mind. If there's no evidence, acquitted. If there's something compelling, you get charged.I feel that it might be years before we even see a case on this topic as not all cases even go to the High Court etc."
I hope we all understand that consent to sex is not automatically a consent to potential parenthood and potential exposure to sexually transmitted diseases.Are there any Singapore laws against women who lie about their contraceptions?
"In a press release, the Ministry of Law and Home Affairs, said: ""...the Bill introduces a new offence criminalising the procurement of sexual activity where consent is obtained by deception or false representation regarding (a) the use or manner of use of a sexually protective device, or (b) whether one is suffering from a sexually transmitted disease.The law is not targeted against males."
"The problem isn't if there are laws against women who lie about their contraceptions, the problem is whether our justice system and society is willing to punish women who lie, with regards to rape accusations/ outrage of modesty etc, equally (e.g. 20 year max sentence for making a false rape accusation, which is the same as what a male rapist can get upon conviction)Thankfully we don't have any cases of false accusations, that I know of (maybe have but never discovered??), but in the event there is, would the male receive justice?"
"lol there are a lot... there's one last month that was a big hoohah on social media, a girl accused a uni student of rape. I'm not gonna pretend i know the truth, but supposedly acquitted alr."
"I think it's only fair that the media reports on rape cases after the perpetrator has been convicted, not after arrest."
"I agree. For the case I was referring to, both TNP and straits times reported, but all personal details were censored, so no issue there either."
Hey I remember getting downvoted to oblivion about that. But yea to some people (mainly men actually) women are children who can't possibly lie. A study of US sexual assault cases found that female jurors were more likely than male jurors to doubt the female defendent.
"Ya la both guys and girls can be fuckers in general, but the case I'm talking about, cannot conclusively say its a false accusation also. These cases are difficult ones."
"A study of US sexual assault cases found that female jurors were more likely than male jurors to doubt the female defendent.Link? Would love to read up more on this.It makes sense though, women probably have a better understanding of how women weaponize sex."
"https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/stanford-rape-case-female-dominated-juries-less-likely-to-convict-in-rape-cases-404525.htmlTurned out to be Ireland not the US, mb. But yea, stats and study cited there"
Not an expert in the legal or sexual acts field but wouldn't it be kinda hard for the man to defend himself against such false claims? Or rather how would the women actually prove he have done such a thing?
"There would be DNA evidence and condom used in most case? If a woman really wants to frame a guy, she can always just frame him for non consensual sex in any case. The new law doesn't make it any easier or harder to make false claims."
"DNA evidence would still be present if the condom broke, wouldn't it?"
"I had an ex who poked a hole in a condom once, so the fact of the matter is that this is very, very real. I've been paranoid about my own stuff since then.I know this has a lot of comedy fodder and there are still many loopholes that can be exploited... But let's not forget that for some people, this strikes close to home, and that at its heart, this Law Reform Bill is a step in the right direction - in this area, anyway."
Siala.Does this mean I need to start taking video evidence to document my condom from now.
yes. make sure to shoot closeup or cannot see if got or not
"The way it's worded suggests that it could work the other way round as well. e.g. a woman intentionally trying to get pregnant despite agreeing to use contraception (""I'm on the pill"")."
"Ya I remember reading some reddit thread where some OP's (ex)girlfriend was taking his semen from used condomedit: found it. though the post was deleted.I remembered the recount goes along:gf asking OP if he's peeing or shitting in the toiletOP jokingly lied as peeing and..OP witness the gf trying to get semen out of the condomedit2: disregard, someone took a screenshot"
"As long as they charge women who fail to use their contraceptives as well, I'll be fine with it."
"In a press release, the Ministry of Law and Home Affairs, said: ""...the Bill introduces a new offence criminalising the procurement of sexual activity where consent is obtained by deception or false representation regarding (a) the use or manner of use of a sexually protective device, or (b) whether one is suffering from a sexually transmitted disease.""Sexually protective device"" could mean the pill, so yeah."
Why didnt u pull out?
Sooo what happens if the condom broke in a situation that is completely out of their control? The guy won't be able to defend himself.
What if the girl say that’s her kink? Now the guy has to take a risk to comply or possibly be blackmail on “stealthing”
"One issue I would foresee is for diseases such as herpes or HPV infection. Herpes can potentially be transmitted via asymptomatic viral shedding and is in the body lifelong - does that mean every single partner must be informed they have a 5% risk of herpes infection even if someone has not had any outbreaks for a year? And herpes is transmitted through direct contact with an infected area, so what about regions not protected by the condom? And HPV? There are types which can cause visible problems such as warts (again, many times in areas not covered by condoms such as the pubis or groin), and there are high risk HPV for cancer which are essentially asymptomatic for both men and women. If a woman has hrHPV (which up to 30% of sexually active women do) and doesn't inform her partner, will that be a crime? And what about oral sex? You can get type 1 herpes at the genital area from someone who had a recent cold sore at the mouth. Is that now a crime? Overall, I agree with the need to protect people from STD's but the law will need a lot of refinement before it is implemented."

"dk why youre downvoted, i actually like this style of videos! i also like another guy called caspian report so you could watch em too if youre interested! would love a singapore/SEA centric one but cant find so eh"
WHY do they LIKE to CAPITALISE random WORDS?
They got the full name of PAP wrong.They have somewhat more research than Nas Daily but and try to put a different spin on things but to attribute so much to LKY without mentioning the team behind him is akin to attributing the founding of modern Singapore solely to Raffles while minimising the role of Farquhar and ignoring the politics oft he day that allowed the British a foothold on Singapore in the first place.

"I have seen this building once awhile before, in a distance during my commute. I have never really been to, or know the about the building, but i am always fascinated and intrigued by the architecture/design. It was until the day i saw the news about it potentially being sold and demolished, i finally know what is it called. Immediately i want to create this in Cities: Skylines, a attempt to preserve it(?) in this medium, and to share it with the rest of the world.I hope this is a good representation of the actual building, with the limited references that i can find online to work with.As i was working on this, there's a turn in the fate of the building. To my knowledge, the building stays for now, but i'm not sure till when.Workshop link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1655331840&tscn=1550164426"
"Oh my, you recreated the entire building in Cities: Skyline! How long did it take?"
"I not sure... i didn't track every hours, but i started just before Christmas last year, on and off, whenever there's time, until... now haha."
"I've been holding off on buying Cities, is it hard to learn?"
"To be honest, i didn't really played the game. Most of my played time is to test the model in game 😅But the game is quite simple to play"
Waiting for the steam sale to get it next! Btw did you study architecture?
"yeah! Steam sale is the best time to get! As well as it's DLCs. So far my items (IIRC) are more vanilla assets. I havn't make anything that is DLC required.I wanted to study architecture when i was choosing my poly course as I was interested in HL's level design software back then. Then i didn't score well enough to enter the course, but i still love to 3d model."
"Your interest in 3D modelling is definitely good enough to showcase your Golden Mile model. Do you think you're done with GM Complex, or do you plan to finetune it even further?"
"There are a few area that i think can improve... like the round windows at the sides, and at the top. I will need to find space in the texture file to fit those windows."
"Nice, good luck to your project!"
"Very nice, what program do you use to make this?"
"Maya and Photoshop for the game model, video recorded from in game, and edited with Sony Vegas.But any 3d modeling, image editing and video editing can do it too. Like blender, gimp"

I wish they really had the donut (0:24) and hot dog (1:49) vans in Singapore!
"That will be really cool!we already have ninja van (the one that randomly and stealthly came to sell snacks), why not have hot dog and donut vans too 😂"
"Love eating Mookata there, thank you for preserving a part of Singaporean history!"
"Thank you for the support. I hope i did a good, not perfect, i admit, but hope it's good"
Can we first have non MOM trains? I would def appreciate it!
"i always try to make these assets to be as vanilla as possible. But sometimes to have the asset behave the way it should, some mods are required. I never dive into making trains, so im not sure if is it possible... Maybe EndlessFTW would know more. (the guy who make the MOM Trains)"
I believe MOM trains are just converted vanilla trains so I don't think it'll be too difficult to turn them back into vanilla trains. It's just I have no idea how.
"Brovo, brutalist awesome!"
Yeah! i also just learnt this type of style is called Brutalist. Im curious to see what other Brutalist style looked like!
BrutalistAnother is the Jurong Town Hall
Oooo
Yooo that's pretty neat.
Thanks! 😊
"Okay, unpopular opinion. Not all buildings are worth saving just because they were there a long time ago. Especially ugly brutalist buildings that contribute nothing to a city except to the architect's ego.Its a good thing that Brutalist architecture is being torn down all over the world , not just in Singapore. For the simple fact that they are really a huge eyesores and only became popular due to the need to rebuild quickly in the aftermath of world war II."
"I agree with you about nto all building are worth saving.I personally find Brutalist buildings are 1 of the kind. But in terms of singapore land space, it is not practical anymore.The building reminded me of Blade Runner"
"I respectfully disagree. I grew up in Dubai, and let me tell you, I am glad I don't live there anymore for the simple fact that I don't have to see a skyscraper shaped like a shampoo bottle every half-a-kilometer. When I moved to Singapore a few years ago, it was exactly these Brutalist buildings - GMC, Pearl Bank Apartments, etc - that really caught my eye. I couldn't tell you why then nor now. Yes, from a very stripped down point of view, I understand why they'd be considered ugly and basic. But there's something absolutely alluring about them. I think most people here only think they're eyesores because it's been part of their peripheral landscape their entire lives. Trust me, spend a decade in a city like Dubai, and a cluster of HDB blocks will be a welcome respite from all the steel and glass humdrum that young cities seem to be head over heels for."
Can be yours or from someone you know...Tekong/Sungei Gedot/Mandai camps etc. Share it!
"Recruit in SCDF. We were practicing marching at about 8ish, behind our bunks (which happened to be beside the cemetery). Our drill instructor told us to face left at one point (which meant facing the cemetery whilst still marching forward) and everyone of us saw someone in a white dress. On the other side of the fence obviously. He quickly ordered us to turn back and we ended marching for the day."
Was it on a Thursday? scary
Happened about 4 years ago so don't remember the specifics
Which company were you? I was 126 intake
132 intake Delta company
"Ahh we had this also, about 4 months back, thursday night and after supper. We didn't march back to coy line properly and had to march towards the cemetery. Everyone was scared shitless and no one dared to talk or look around. Our DI told us to stop, make a 180 turn and run back to coy line. The moment we reached coy line, there was a loud bang from the bunks above. After fall out, we made our way back to our bunks and the sound that we heard was our lockers. As if someone had a fit of rage and knocked down half of the lockers in the bunk to it's side."
150th intake. Just POPed bravo company whole company could hear laughing from like woman. We bastard also laugh
Was forced to do the same thing cause some of the guys wouldn't shut up during the march back from supper. What occurred to me was I was staring too long at the semi pitch darkness of the cemetery and started hallucinating. It was trippy and unnerving.
Our drill instructor told us to face left at one point (which meant facing the cemetery whilst still marching forward) and everyone of us saw someone in a white dress.for some reason I thought they just wanted y'all to look at the person in the white dress
"Nah, in all honesty he freaked out more than us. We considered it more like a bonding moment more than anything. It's not like whatever we saw actually disturbed us"
"I served at Stagmont camp. I stayed at the infamous 6th floor bunk. On my first day, I thought the seniors were kidding me about mass haunting. It didn’t take long. On my second day, I heard the cupboards shaking in our bunk room. All of those senior guys were hearing too with me. I tried to get up and check it out but my bunk mates were gesturing me not to confront it. The night passed by but it was awful. I didn’t sleep well. But it was a regular thing for the seniors. They didn’t lose much sleep. Months gone by with the cupboard shaking once or twice a week. The unit commanders would listen to our complaints but the best they could do was to hire some priests to go and perform some prayers at our banks during day-time. They wouldn’t change our bunks but would convince us the priests have taken care of it every single time. But it was not the case. The haunting would be back a few days after the prayers. I got used to it after some time. But it got only worse over time. There was some old guy singing in the bunk’s shower sometimes. I myself encountered once when I was showering alone and there’s water flowing past from the shower beside me even though no one was showering then. And there’s one girl shouting from the stair case landing on few occasions around dusk time. The cupboard didn’t only shake but sometimes something would punch on it also. It was hard staying at that infamous bunk but fatigue would help my sleep most of the time."
"I heard one of the bunks on that floor was locked. MPs heard noise from inside when raiding the unit, so they tried to break in. Against the advice of the CSM, they cut open the locks and found the cupboards in a circle with a talisman on each of them and no one inside."
Oh I see. This is so creepy. Do you know the meaning of such circle? I’d be glad if the floor locked was the floor I stayed 10 years ago. No poor guys have to stay there anymore then.
"No idea about the circle, apparently the CSM then also didn't know? I think it was the top floor too."
I see. Thanks for the details. Now those visuals of the cupboards are striking me back. That place is better to stay away.
"Sounds like they are trying to contain the ""thing"" within the circle."
Man that legit gave me some shivers. How is this stuff real geez
to add to the 'punching locker' sound. I was doing guard duty on a friday with my friend and we went up to our bunk after everyone booked out to take our wallets. went up our bunk (level 4) and while opening our locker we heard that punching locker sound. we looked at each other and gtfo outta there.on a later date nearing to the end of course everyone in my bunk heard a rhythmic tapping on the ceiling/wall above us. it went on for about 30mins
Oh man 30 mins was intense. Did you happen investigate the ceiling or the floor above?
yup it was about 9pm and the all of us went up to check but those on level 5 didn't hear anything lmao. couldn't do anything about it
"Had a friend's bro tell me a story abt his friend's stay there back many years ago. Apparently his friend couldn't sleep that particular night whilst everyone else already was deep asleep. He saw a girl at the foot of his dorm,she looked very normal, nothing off about her. But of course he knew it's not a vry normal sighting since females and especially someone so little like her couldn't get anywhere near the dorm. So here's the creepy part, this girl goes to the foot of the 1st bed and lingers for awhile and whispers,""Sleeping"". Then the 3rd, 4th bed etc. When she came to his bed, he was scared shitless and tried to stay still,pretending to be asleep. She took quite long but confirmed,""Sleeping"". She started again from the first bed and got to him and this time he heard,""Not sleeping!"". He just sat up on his bed screaming until the whole bunk was wide-eyed awake. No one slept that night."
When was this?
It was 10 years ago.

"Bmt 100m night firing. Order given ""watch your front"". Few seconds later, everybody saw movements resembling the target boards and almost everybody fired off.

Maybe their systems were faulty

My bmt was quite long ago so not sure but doesn't the announcer say target up when they go up? Ez mistake though
"Wasn't this like a case study?My encik said they triggered the target boards by accident, one bobo decide to fire, the rest follow suit cos kancheong"
"It actually happened during my time. Instructions was already given to 'watch your front' so people thought the movings things were the target boards.How true that the system malfunctioned, i don't know"
"At the back of my camp is a tank shed where tanks will drive out from a gate into the rough terrain for training and exercises, which is out of bounds to public. So during the time when theres no hp, every time when tanks are back after exercise all tired and dirty, they will be stuck at the gates to go inside camp. One unlucky soldier will have to run all the way thru the tank shed, parade square, up a hill and to the bunks to call the COS. The COS would then run the same way back to open the gates for the tanks to park. Thus during an idea implementation project, someone thought of doing an electronic bell connecting the gate to the COS office. So when tanks are back, they just need to press the bell, and the COS will hear it in his office, and will come down to open the gates. A while after, on some nights the COS on duty will hear the bell and go all the way to the gate to find there’s no one there. Another time, the COS heard the bell but knows something is wrong as there’s no exercise that day so he stay put. But the bell keeps ringing, as if to taunt the poor guy on duty."
Is this Keat Hong camp?
No it’s Sungei Gedong
Sungei Gedot has some legit ghost dudes waiting to haunt poor army dudes since the cemetery is so nearby. Well-occupied hantus.
Sounds like the AETC location. Those memories.
Lol bingo dude... memories indeed
D801.. is it still called that? I went back many years back for reservist.
"Yes d801! I totally forgot! Not sure if it’s still the same, haven been back for a Long while lol"

"During BMT at Tekong, woke up at around 2.45am as I needed to shit. While shitting, heard someone whistling outside my cubicle.""Who's that?""The whistling stops. No footsteps coming in, no footsteps going out.Woke up in the middle of the night suddenly once, saw a figure walking outside the corridor. There were windows on the left and right with the door right in the middle.The figure was walking slowly past the left window to the right. If it was someone walking, he would have disappeared into the middle where the door was and appeared on the other side.However, the figured disappeared into the middle and I was waiting for it to show up on the other side.It didn't. I was sleepy and and I was looking at the right window for at least 20 seconds. Nothing.I sometimes hear, if not for the fact that I was on Tekong, things that would otherwise have been ordinary on the mainland. I woke up one morning at 4.55am because we had to fall in at 5.30am and there usually would be a mad rush in the toilets as everyone wants to brush their teeth and long queues at the water coolers, so I woke up earlier to beat the queue.Everyone in my platoon (level) was still sleeping as none of the bunks have lights on. I was walking to the toilet at the end of the corridor when I heard a young girl screaming from downstairs. The kind of scream which you will hear from naughty or upset kids at a playground.I didn't even realize something was wrong until we fall-ed in. A young girl scream? On Tekong? At 5am in the morning?Edit: Another story, heard this from my bunkmate. He claimed that he woke up in the middle of the night and saw a long-haired woman peering at HIM from MY bed. The woman was kind of like sitting on the floor beside my bed and he could only see the top half of her head from his bed (woman was on my right side, his bed was a few beds away on my left). He got scared and went back to sleep.I called bullshit on this one because I heard many people telling me that this guy didn't like me for some reasons. When he related the story to me, he had this grin on his face which I suspect he was just trying to scare me."
Honestly the girl scream could just be a cat or something.
"There is a group of kitties that chill underneath my block late at night. On some nights, I wake up to hear shrills and screams. They sound very ominous. I only found out that those were cats when my friend sent me a recording of his cat wailing when it fell ill."
there are girl coys now though
"We didn't have any female intake at that point in time, not in our school anyway. The company opposite was vacant and behind us was the field."
Creepy af
Maybe is your sergeant walking past to see anyone using phone during lights out
"A piercing, high pitched shriek made me sit straight up from a deep slumber. Thinking I was the only one who heard it, I looked around my bunk and caught sight of my other mates who also sat up. We asked each other ""you heard that right?"" After confirming that we did hear that shriek, we went back to sleep.I don't know how much time passed, but another shriek woke me up again and made me sit straight up. This time, everyone in my bunk was up and without saying a word, many, including me, went to the toilet only to find more recruits from other platoons in the toilet too.Everyone heard that shriek.This was more than a decade ago, in SCDF BRTC.We later learned that one of our mates in the adjacent bunk claimed to have seen a lady with long hair standing beside his bed, looking at him. However, I don't remember if he ever said he was the one who shrieked.Another one. I heard it from the duty officer at BRTC. One recruit apparently spoke in tongue and had to be restrained by about 8 recruits in the night. Even then, they struggled to hold him down.The next morning at the parade square, that same recruit spoke in tongue again, prompting the then duty encik to slap his face. This was enough to stop the tongue-speak, and that recruit was all normal again."
"Glad I just completely covered myself with a blanket because I got the top bunk and the chibai strong fan would wake me up to chills but on the plus side, obscures other sounds. I can confirm from several platoon mates they heard shrieks throughout BRTC and I fortunately slept through it."
"Happened in JC1 , in the middle of the night , one of the lockers beside the bunk I am in , suddenly came crashing down , it was so loud that everyone got woke up , the next day heard from my friends that the poor guy whom used the locker was telling his bunk mates right before the incident happened late night that he didn’t believe in supernatural stuff. Creepy."
I thought JC1 meant first year of JC and was thoroughly confused for a minute lol.
"Sorry for the confusion , jc1 = Jurong camp 1"
"Something with a male voice shook me awake in the middle of the night and told me “Phil...Phil”. I proceed to get woken up at precisely 3am until the next bookout, when I brought back a talisman for book in.Another is not mine, but a WO encountered a woman eating a “ball-thing” during his own NS. He and the drivee got off the tonner to ask if she was alright (In the past there were little to no barriers between villages and training areas. And she started speed crawling towards them. They got into the vehicle and drove off, only to hear banging on the roof of the cab until they reached camp."
Wa the second one I'll fucking shit my pants if it happened to me.
He needed Dr.Phil to iron out his issues.

"This happened a few weeks back, when we were doing a summex exercise in Sembawang Air Base. We were doing force protection at the old 506 Squadron building (basically protecting a KIN). It was around midnight when the prowlers noticed that one of the rooms had lights on. The moment one of the prowlers placed his hand on the window pane to check if there was anyone inside, the light just went off. Afterwards, he started experiencing stuff where his cyalum stick would drop off his ILBV even though it was tied double knotted, and his cuff also dropped off mysteriously (the grenade pouch clip and cuff did not came undone). We could also hear the sound of door knocking coming from that area as well.After that our trainer asked us not to approach that area anymore, and we continued with the summex. One of the prowlers felt very uncomfortable after that incident, and his buddy (other prowler) came down with a fever (38.7) and had to be evac to Nee Soon camp."
Thankfully didn’t see anything.But ah..The scariest shit I’ve ever seen was during training as a cadet and my course encik came to my deployment area at 3am with full camo on. That night I rather see a ghost.

"In Nee soon camp bmtc, I kept hearing marching noises at the parade square when I slept, couldn’t sleep well a single night, but that could have been just hallucination. Any one else experienced this?"
"Me too, more than 20 years ago in the old wing. Only on the 1st night of enlistment though. Whole bunk heard marching and someone giving commands in Japanese, but no one was on the parade square."
When you get constipation right after not shitting in field camp
"Heard a couple of stories from my friend who went to home team academy.For their toilets, you turn left for the showers and right for the toilets. You only see a wall from the door. So, you have to enter, turn right and then turn left to go to the toilet. You can see the mirror at the sinks from the cubicles. One time, someone wanted to shit but he didn't want to bother his buddy so he went alone. After doing his business, his walked over to the sink to wash his hands. He saw a head sticking out from one of the cubicles and staring at him.This story is about the regular coy building. There's this one girl who suddenly seemed possessed and wanted to jump off the building. It took many people to restrain her and the duty officer (don't know what they're called) called in a priest to handle the situation. That was apparently not an isolated incident and similar incidents had happened in the past with the female regulars. My friend said that there's a visible dent on of the ground level shelters where someone had supposedly fallen onto."
"Yes, this seems to be a common phenomena with female regulars. Maybe they're more sensitized to supernatural energies ? which explains why there were many precautionary measures older female folks used to take when they're out late."
"Another personal incident that happened on a rifle range.We were doing nite firing and I was responsible for turning the lights on and off during the silhouette shoots. All went fine for the first 3 details.During the 4th shoot, OC buzzed me to turn on the lights which I had already done so. Checking the switches< I radioed back that it's on. But walking out to look at the targets, the lights were off.A bit of testing on the switches tell me that for some reason, 2 of the switches had been swapped. Don't ask me how it happened, But it did."
"Former SCDF boy, this happened to my Rota mate, who basically told me never to use the toilet at night.During night shift (8pm-8am), he had to go to the toilet, nearest toilet happened to be down this long corridor with energy saving lights (y'know, the kind that only lights up on sensing movement). Toilet light sensor also the same.He goes into the toilet, does his business, then as he was washing his hands, he heard flushing from the toilet cubicle (NOTE, nobody else went to toilet with him), and then the tap next to him just turned on by itself.He freaked out, ran out of the toilet and from then on, never went back to that toilet during night shift."
"Over 20 years ago, recruit at old Nee Soon Camp BMTC, first day of enlistment, first night in bunk. Everyone was fast asleep, and at about 2am, a loud voice came from the parade square which woke everyone. Then we heard someone marching on the parade square, and someone giving commands... in Japanese! Some of my platoon mates sleeping near the windows, looked through the panes, but saw no one on the parade square even though we could still hear the noise. We were looking at each other, wondering what's going on while the noise subsides. Corporal on duty came up soon after, and told us all to go back to sleep unless we want to fall in."
i saw my encik the other day then suddenly got hit by the force of three extras
during the 13/14 300+psi haze period. had rsm parade in the day.. most caught for long hair or unpolish boots.punishment was to do another parade inspection at night at Parade square. Due to haze rsm called it off.. one coy csm decide to be hero and gather all of us at lecture theater to do inspection...1 coy de solider was not feeling well that evening.. his platoon IC req that his mate be seated during the waiting and stand only when being inspected.. csm say no.. argue argue.. IC went out of bunk and take parang..(last time ic can keep parang in bunk for some reason...after that all return to store) wanna 'chop' csm..got stop by coy mate and the SGT
Now you know why ic cannot keep parang liao
"Noting exactly very scary but during training at MPTS, Mowbray Camp.It was said whole level was haunted, where the bunks are.Quite often many nights, many of us would wake up at the same time, around 3am, for no reason. Our eyes will just open and we'll stare at the ceiling."
"Is it level 5? Currently there and I tend to wake up at 3am almost everyday but I never thought of it as anything paranormal. I just know that years ago, an instructor woke up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet to pee at the urinal and heard someone calling his name from the left side. He ignored it, quickly finished his business, washed his hands and gtfo."
At least he washed his hands. Priorities.
MP mah. Hear ghost also must be professional hahahahah
Heard this story as well haha 😂
I used to wake up at 3am as well to go to the toilet. It was eerie af cos the toilet mirrors span through and the entire toilet is pretty big. Didn't see anything but it was a very dreaded experience every night.
This was a real good read..thanks for sharing
"In BMTC2 Pegasus company, this was in 2001.There was one night when things were weird in Platoon 4.One recruit Tan from Section 1 from Bed 1/2 decided to sleep in Bed 13 as he didnt want to have to make his bed the next morning. When he woke up, Cupboard 13 was open and had its mirror cracked. It was fine previously.Going back to his bed during area cleaning, they found long hair which cannot be explained.The same morning in Section 3, we found a footprint above one of the standard cupboards that we use as a store cupboard. It was a footprint, not a shoeprint. How the hell did that happened?"
what with Tekong and it long hair? kenna bef too (2012 sch 4. 1st COY) after sun bookin saw long hair on some bed and a handprint outside the window at the edge (noway we can leave it there unless I climb outside since it at the edge (believe me.. i tried just in case it was my own.. but nope..)
"BMT Tekong Hawk COY. Was woken up by what felt like someone tugging on my leg telling me that I am late to fall in.Woke up reluctantly, sat up to realise that no one else besides me was awake. Checked the time and realised that it was the famed '3am'. Chanted some prayers and went back asleep."
"My grab to camp today because i woke up late was 24$, that's more than i make in a day and it's fucking spooky man."
"Over 20 years ago, recruit at old Nee Soon Camp BMTC doing prowling. Prowling route will pass by a big old tree which is said to be haunted. One person in front, one behind, with a rather big gap in-between and no talking between the two persons while prowling (It was too far anyway). There was this guy in front from another platoon, and I was the one behind. We went through the route uneventfully until the last part where we needed to pass by the big old tree. When we were approaching the tree, the guy in front suddenly stopped. To maintain the distance between us, I stopped as well. I was wondering what he was up to, when he suddenly moved again. He was obviously moving much faster than before and kept increasing in speed, and I had to keep up. Back at the barracks, he was clearly shaken and I asked him what happened. He asked if I've seen a lady in white sitting on a branch on the big tree, waving at us? I didn't see anything, and that was indeed an eerie revelation since we were supposed to go for another round after some rest. On the second round, the same thing happens. Uneventful until the big tree, he stopped on approach (I looked towards the tree but failed to see anything), he then moved and sped up suddenly, but this time he looked back at me after we moved some distance past the tree. That was when he started to run, and I had to follow. When approaching the guard house, the sergeant saw us running and shouted at us (as we were not supposed to run but walk during prowling). But when he saw the paleness on that guy's face and asked him what happened, he warned us not to say anything to the others and told us to go rest at the barracks. It was only then that I had the opportunity to ask him for more details. It turns out that when he turned and looked past me, he saw the lady in white who was previously sitting on the branch waving at us, ""flew"" towards us at great speed, and that was why he started running. Fortunately, that was the end of our prowling duty."
"Over 20 years ago, recruit at old Nee Soon Camp BMTC, nearing time for POP. Entire bunk was asleep after lights out except for 5 of my platoon mates. There was this TV series by the name of 雪山飞狐 running it's last episode on TV. They wanted to watch, and smuggled in a small portable TV. A while into the show, they all heard metal chains rattling. At first they thought it came from one of the characters in the show, but seeing no one was ""captured"" in the story they became puzzled and looked at each other in confusion. That was when they realized a 6th ""head"" (shadow) among them looking at the TV, watching the show with them. Realizing that it was ""discovered"", the shadow moved rapidly towards one of the metal cabinets in the corner and disappeared through and into it. The 5 of them were so afraid that without discussing, they decided to forego watching and immediately headed back to their respective beds. They related the story to us in the morning, and it seemed none of them got any sleep for that night after that episode."

"From the replies gathered it seems it is common for not only the posters themselves, but their platoon mates also see and hear the same things from the same spots. It would be interesting to see how scientist will dismiss them as “hallucinations”."
There is actually a term for this. Scientists call it mass hysteria. I do believe in the paranormal though but they seem to dismiss things like that.

"Was a specialist cadet in stagmont camp during the time this happened. Stayed at the third floor if i remember correctly. Casually using my phone under the blankets after lights out and when i put it down to go to sleep, heard a female voice clearly saying “what now?” As if though that “female” was asking what I was going to do next. Needless to say, couldn’t sleep the entire night."
"Over 20 years ago, recruit at old Nee Soon Camp BMTC, attend C barrack due to a fever on a ""night training"" night, resting alone in 3rd storey bunk past 2am. Bunk rumored to be haunted, especially so after a guy from previous batch committed suicide by jumping through the glass panes falling 3 floors down. There was a Taoist altar of some sort directly outside the bunk door which never seemed to run out of burning incense. I've seen encik and some corporals lighting incense on some occasions. Lying on my lower tier bed, I awoke some time after 1am and could not get back to sleep. The rest of my platoon was still out for night training, and no one was around in the company line except a corporal in the office on the ground floor. At around 2am, I was facing up looking at the ceiling fan through the side (since top was blocked by upper tier bed) and the opened bunk door was in view. Suddenly, something bright appeared outside the bunk door, and a long piece of white, bright ""cloth"" flew into the bunk near the ceiling. It started to circulated around the moving ceiling fan and kept doing that without entangling to the fan blades. I just lied there and watched. Thought I was hallucinating, and can't believe my own eyes. For some reason, there was no fear but amazement on seeing that. It went on for about 30 minutes and disappeared when my platoon came back from training."

The STB brown signs indicate tourist attractions or landmarks.Tamil has also been added to the brown signs for Lau Pa Sat Festival Market and Merlion Park near the Esplanade Bridge, which did not have Tamil in photos taken in 2012.The signs for the Burmese Buddhist Temple and Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall in Ah Hood Road also now have Malay and Tamil translations.In 2012, the sign for the temple had English, Chinese, Japanese and Burmese, while the sign for the memorial hall was only in English and Chinese.But a sign for the Indian National Army monument in Connaught Drive is only in English and a sign for the Sultan Mosque is still missing Tamil.The National Heritage Board, which is the agency behind the Changi Beach plaque, the Singapore Tourism Board and the Changi Airport Group did not respond to queries by press time.Mr R. Rajaram, chairman of the Tamil Language Council, welcomed the inclusion of Tamil in more public signs, including those in Chinatown. ""To a Tamil-speaking tourist, it conveys to him that this is Chinatown in Singapore, where there is diversity even in an ethnic enclave.""But disparities in the use of Tamil across Changi Airport's terminals seem to suggest an inconsistency, he said. The authorities can come up with a guideline to standardise policies on language use across the public institutions, he added.Many public institutions and monuments do use all four official languages in their signage. They include the Singapore Conference Hall in Shenton Way and most public schools, which bear the Malay name at the top, followed by Chinese, Tamil and English.This underlines the status of Malay as national language, Dr Peter Tan, a senior lecturer in the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Department of English Language and Literature, wrote in a 2011 paper.In response to Mr Yeo's views, experts interviewed said a balance must be struck between pragmatism and the preservation of cultural identity.War memorials such as the Sook Ching site at Changi Beach, for instance, warrant the use of four languages as they carry a deep meaning as public symbols of trauma and triumph, said literary and cultural critic Nazry Bahrawi.He added that the four languages should also be used at heritage sites as diversity needs to be foregrounded at these sites, or at emergency exits, where safety is of paramount concern.But it is not practical to expect this for all road signs due to space constraints, said Associate Professor Lee Cher Leng from NUS' Department of Chinese Studies.However, given that the use of mother tongue languages is on the decline, encouraging the use of all four languages on these signs sends a strong signal of Singapore's commitment to preserving linguistic diversity, they said.English is the most common language spoken at home, with 36.9 per cent of Singapore households who did so in 2015, compared with less than 2 per cent of households in 1957. By the late 1980s, English had become the main medium of instruction in schools.""The depreciating use of vernacular languages has implications beyond signage. To put it bluntly, every ethnic community in Singapore today is seeing their younger generations become less proficient at using their mother tongues,"" said Dr Nazry.Language historian and translator Tan Dan Feng said having more multilingual signs would expose Singaporeans to their mother tongues in their daily lives and affirm their status as ""living languages"" in society.Other than tourist hot spots, he has observed that an increasing number of signs and notices in places such as wet markets or void decks are now solely in English.In an ongoing study, Prof Lee observed that foodcourts - which started in the mid-1980s - tend to have only English stall names, unlike the multilingual signs at older hawker centres that may feature Malay, Arabic and romanised dialect names of Chinese stalls.The use of Western names by Chinese Singaporeans, as well as hanyu pinyin rather than dialect names, is also on the rise, she added.""(These trends) mark a decline of our rich diversity and identity,"" she said.Mr Tan said increasing the use of all official languages on public signs and notices is an important and effective way to ensure that Singapore does not lose its polyglot DNA.""In a world where most countries are seeing more linguistic diversity, it is worth reflecting whether Singapore can afford to move in the opposite direction."""

They include the Singapore Conference Hall in Shenton Way and most public schools, which bear the Malay name at the top, followed by Chinese, Tamil and English.This underlines the status of Malay as national language, Dr Peter Tan, a senior lecturer in the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Department of English Language and Literature, wrote in a 2011 paper.In response to Mr Yeo’s views, experts interviewed said a balance must be struck between pragmatism and the preservation of cultural identity.War memorials such as the Sook Ching site at Changi Beach, for instance, warrant the use of four languages as they carry a deep meaning as public symbols of trauma and triumph, said literary and cultural critic Nazry Bahrawi.He added that the four languages should also be used at heritage sites as diversity needs to be fore- grounded at these sites, or at emergency exits, where safety is of paramount concern.But it is not practical to expect this for all road signs due to space constraints, said Associate Professor Lee Cher Leng from NUS’ Department of Chinese Studies.However, given that the use of mother tongue languages is on the decline, encouraging the use of all four languages on these signs sends a strong signal of Singapore’s commitment to preserving linguistic diversity, they said.English is the most common language spoken at home, with 36.9 per cent of Singapore households who did so in 2015, compared with less than 2 per cent of households in 1957. By the late 1980s, English had become the main medium of instruction in schools.“The depreciating use of vernacular languages has implications beyond signage. To put it bluntly, every ethnic community in Singapore today is seeing their younger generations become less proficient at using their mother tongues,” said Dr Nazry.Language historian and translator Tan Dan Feng said having more multilingual signs would expose Singaporeans to their mother tongues in their daily lives and affirm their status as “living languages” in society.Other than tourist hot spots, he has observed that an increasing number of signs and notices in places such as wet markets or void decks are now solely in English.In an ongoing study, Prof Lee observed that foodcourts – which started in the mid-1980s – tend to have only English stall names, un- like the multilingual signs at older hawker centres that may feature Malay, Arabic and romanised dialect names of Chinese stalls.The use of Western names by Chinese Singaporeans, as well as hanyu pinyin rather than dialect names, is also on the rise, she added.“(These trends) mark a decline of our rich diversity and identity,” she said.Mr Tan said increasing the use of all official languages on public signs and notices is an important and effective way to ensure that Singapore does not lose its polyglot DNA.“In a world where most countries are seeing more linguistic diversity, it is worth reflecting whether Singapore can afford to move in the opposite direction.”0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

"Will anyone be able to recommend/share your experiences on accommodations around/near the unis like Monash, UNSW, Tasmania or Queensland? Not looking into staying at uni hostels. I wld also like to know the pros and cons of living in some suburbs/cities in Australia.Hoping to get the pov from Singaporean students as I wld be furthering my studies in Australia & will be considering accommodations alongside other factors when choosing a uni. Thank you!!"
"I used to live in Melbourne and stayed at UniLodge. The particular one I stayed in was UniLodge D1 if I remember the name correctly. It was basically a studio apartment, and everyone else that lived in the building were students too. You had to be 18 years or older to live in the studio buildings though. If you are younger, they have other units around the city, but you would have to share a room with a roommate. I'm pretty sure their presence is all over Australia, not just Melbourne. Check it out, I made a lot of friends because many were like me, students who left home and living by themselves (be it foreigners or locals from other states in Australia)."
Single studio has the neat benefit of having your own toilet.
And your own kitchen if I am not mistaken?
"I'm sorry but Unilodge is absolute shit.You are overpaying for a tiny dog box. It has a horrible reputation among the locals, but it still somehow survives thanks to international students who are getting ripped off unknowingly.You can get better places for similar prices if you hunt around."
"UniLodge was definitely on the slightly higher end of the price scale, but I wouldn't say it was absolute shit (not the one that I stayed in anyway). Not sure what the situation is now, but back when I was living in Melbourne 10 years ago, I couldn't say that it had any negative reputation."
"As far as market prices go, Unilodge isn't that expensive. What's the issue is that for the price you pay for Unilodge, you're not getting your money's worth. There are plenty of new apartments with much better amenities for the same price, most come with a gym and a pool minimum nowadays.I'm Aussie, Unilodge has always had a bad reputation among locals as an overpriced dog box. Most off campus rentals marketed as student accommodations are usually rip offs, that's why the tenants are mostly foreign students."
"First year/semester stay in uni accomodation or nearby hostels. Once you get familiar and more comfortable, you can try looking to rent a room further away where the rent is cheaper."
"Call the University of your choice that your looking for accommodation. They may be Facebook groups available.-Keep your share house to 3 people max.-Landlords will be cunts most of the time.-Stay only a suburb away from your campus.noise canceling ear muffs from Bunnings will help you concentrate when construction takes place.check areas that have NBN.You may find Uber cheaper than public transport ( 8 aud per trip )To save money during the summer when you can hire a storage unit to save by the thousands by not paying rent when you transfer lease.Take care OP for your time in Australia.Go out with the student Union on Pubcrawls to mingle.Sincerely, Former uni student in Australia."
"I use flatmates.com.au to find my house. Studying at Monash and living in Clayton, just <1km from school. Personally I chose my current area since its nearby school and the gym. Suburbs here at night can get pretty dark and you could get jumped on if not aware of your surroundings."
"Stayed at a sharehouse (aka renting with other people), I found on the uni classifieds...Cheap but aint gonna do that shit again. Probably better to stay in uni accomodation to make friends and rent with people you know later on."
"Try unilodge or urbanest if you want housing near uni for students that isn't a uni dorm. You can choose from studio, one bedroom or up to five bedrooms depending on your preferences and budget. Otherwise look into renting an apartment or room in a sharehouse. Both options cost about the same - unilodge IIRC charges the equivalent of market rent + utilities etc. but doesn't provide food options so you have to cook for yourself."
"There are Singapore associations/student societies of the respective unis, a quick search via facebook or through IDP can help you link up with them, some of them have pre-departure meetings etc.That said, don't be afraid to stay with non-Singaporean students. From locals to international students to exchange students. It can be quite boring if you do not mingle with non-Singaporeans. Yeah there are stories, but it is a good experience imo haha."
"I stayed in unilodge & then a shared house with 3 people.UnilodgePros:You don’t really have to worry about basic amenities. Everything is included in the rent.The management has the best response time of all the options. Light broken? Fixed the next day. Stove doesn’t work? Fixed the next day.Nice entertainment room with cable.Your own toilet.Cons:If you choose shared apartment, you don’t get to choose your housemate. I got lucky with a older masters student who generally was neat and quite a nice guy. My friend got a party animal.Expensive. At least $150 more than other places.3 man apartmentAfter my first sem I made some friends who were looking to move. So I did.Pros:Cheaper.You get to pick your own buddies.Cons:Being friends and staying with each other is very different. One of the guys I stayed with emerged as an giant asshole.Settling household expenses may get sticky at times. Like we buy toiletries and this guy refused to pay. Saying he don’t need. Then when run out always say paiseh paiseh can take anot?Chores. Everyone has to pull their weight. Especially since we had one toilet and nobody wants to clean the toilet.Settling amenities is a bitch in Australia. Took us 2 weeks to get internet.Someone has to foot the bills, and then everyone else pay. Sometimes people forget.Household pests."
"At the risk of sounding elitist, but coming from an Aussie I think you should stick to the group of 8 unis.I'm not sure why you're discounting uni hostels, on campus accommodation is great and the social activities they have can really help you make friends.I wld also like to know the pros and cons of living in some suburbs/cities in Australia.That's an incredibly broad question, I think you'll have to do your own homework there."
"If you’re studying at Monash in Caulfield, Parkville or the city colleges you can look at Urbanest! Very small for the price but well taken care of. There’s Scape Swanston but it’s terrible and far far FAR overpriced with terrible staff"
Buy a house / car as investment. Sell it after you grad / leave.
You sponsor?
SG got a lot of private Aussie uni too
Cars are a depreciating asset. And the housing bubble is slowly popping. Terrible advice all around.
"That you can use everyday. Convenience and practicality. “Investment” not necessarily mean pure monetary profit. Time value of money?Housing you can even keep it if you decide later on to work there instead of coming back. You get to bring friends, throw party and decorate however you want instead of restricted by landlords or roommates.“Terrible advice”? You obviously never studied overseas, plenty of foreign students (Not just from SG) who buy car / house for their study period there. Granted most don’t, but for those that can afford it, do it. If you want to be frugal and think too hard on “depreciating assets” might as well stay in SG (plenty of private uni, even Aussie ones)"
"Damn, you doubled down on your stupidity.Cars are only a necessity if you're studying in some outer suburb campus. For the most part it's more beneficial to live within walking or tram distance from campus.Housing you can even keep it if you decide later on to work there instead of coming back.Buying at the height of our property bubble is stupid advice, especially when it's showing signs of popping in the next few years. You clearly have a very poor grasp of finances and the property market, so you really shouldn't be giving any advice here.You get to bring friends, throw party and decorate however you want instead of restricted by landlords or roommates.How is this an investment?“Terrible advice”? You obviously never studied overseas, plenty of foreign students (Not just from SG) who buy car / house for their study period there.I'm Australian lmao."
"Maybe you need to expand your group of friends. There are many who bought cars / property while studying there. Some people are more concern with privacy / freedom / convenience than penny pinching.Not saying everyone like that, but most who are study abroad are well off. There are plenty of Aussie private uni courses in SG for the others.It boils down to what your priorities and capabilities. Some want to splurge, while others find it wasteful. No binary answer as it depend on individual."
"It doesn't matter how many students bought cars or property there. It doesn't make it a good financial investment.Like I said, when you have zero knowledge on a subjcet, it's better to not try to give advice."
"Cause all investment has to be ‘financial’ right. Opportunity cost who right... people should never buy depreciating cost goods right... individual priorities / financial capabilities are all the same right...You might want to try and expand your horizon a bit for some experience, it’s not healthy to be cocoon in your bubble.But then again, it’s kinda reminding me of all those years of having to tolerate obnoxious Aussie thinking they knows more than others despite being stuck in down under."
"So explain to me what kind of investment is this?You get to bring friends, throw party and decorate however you want instead of restricted by landlords or roommates.HAHAHAHHAOpportunity cost who right... people should never buy depreciating cost goods right... individual priorities / financial capabilities are all the same right...Oh god. It's like some idiot throwing out random words. Are you even speaking English?""opportunity cost who right"", what are you even trying to say?And no, it's basic common sense to not buy at the height of a property bubble that shows signs of popping. Something you clearly lack yet are trying to give advice which is frankly amazing.You might want to try and expand your horizon a bit for some experience, it’s not healthy to be cocoon in your bubble.I've studied at universities in Australia (ANU and Uni Melb) and Singapore (NUS). I've worked in Chicago, Hong Kong and now Singapore. Tell me more about ""be cocoon in your bubble"".You're clearly a poorly educated person who's probably lived in Singapore in his entire life.But then again, it’s kinda reminding me of all those years of having to tolerate obnoxious Aussie thinking they knows more than others despite being stuck in down under.LOL! You must be one of those Singaporeans who had to go a lesser known Australian university because you couldn't make it at a local university. Your standard of English and the level of ""intelligence"" you've shown in this short conversation strongly suggests that."
"Since your view of investment = monetary gain / loss, you’ll need more help than from a redditor.ANU / NUS alumni thinks opportunity cost / depreciation / goods are random English words (likely arts major). Well, they do say most degree holders are merely holding a piece of paper.Hahaha you’re one of those that throws around their school name like it means something. In every school, there are tier 1 degree courses and lower tiers. All the liberal arts / Asian studies student love to brag about being from NUS / NTU too. Fyi, just because you’re from same school does not mean others view you as peers.Based on your cv, you are absolutely right. I’m unworthy as I needed financial help from state to read PPE at some far flung “SomeThing” John college and had to be tutored throughout.Also, the undergrad programme from my grad school in US are known for students who can’t count. I’m truly ashamed of my insignificant educational background. I’m truly envious of ANU / NUS intellect like you. My level of “intelligence” from being poorly educated is truly a burden I have to live with.My comments were made in haste, now I shall repent in leisure."
"Talk about your day. Anything goes, but subreddit rules still apply. Please be polite to each other!"
Walao eh I cannot sleep.
go out n run lor
Heading for some treadmill test on Tuesday as a result of a further referral from my NS Medical - something to do with my heart. Can anyone tell me what to expect and how long it will take?
my friend went there without knowing he needed to do a treadmill test.IIRC the obvious one is bringing jogging attire and there might be some parent consent required. Not exactly sure
"It'll take at most a few hours, some pads will be stuck to you with wires connected and you'll run on the treadmill at increasing speeds and incline.They'll get your heart rate to a certain level and then they'll stop the treadmill.Nothing to worry about! Just wear running shoes."
So I'm just going there to run basically :/ Sounds like a waste of time haha. Thanks for the info!
Good luck! Hope all's fine with your heart. I remember panicking when they told me I had to head to National Heart Centre for an additional checkup. Turns out I was fine and placed in PES B1.
"I'm perfectly fine haha, I just had a heart issue when I was like 3 or 4 years old. I got cleared off it long ago but they just want to make sure I'm ok. Thank you!"
"30-60 mins, nothing much just get your HR up and they'll stick some electrodes to you to see how fast you catch your breath."
"Just thought I'd share this here. I just feel that it should be more exposed that people should know about these things. Especially in a country like Brunei where information and news is restricted and controlled. A cross post from r/Brunei.Shahiran is the man in Brunei who made a Facebook post against unreasonable halal certifications and requirements .

Anyone know where is a good dating place in the CBD/Central area where you can get coffee for your first date?
baristart coffee or omotesando koffee (this one is just a stand tho!)
"Going to Tokyo in March, any recommendations on what to do and what NOT to do? I mean places and activities, am aware of cultural norms. 🇯🇵"
bring a small list of emergency numbers with you
"If you're alone, don't walk into Kabukicho, especially if you're carrying a camera - worst decision I made ever. Some places in Shibuya can also be quite shady at night, so try to stay around the crossing area."
This is what I’m looking for - thanks! What did you enjoy most about Tokyo? Which places in particular?
"There's alot that I enjoyed in Tokyo. It might not apply to you because I did mostly photography there since I am a photographer, but here are some suggestions:Shinjuku Omoide Yokocho - Hands down my favourite place in Tokyo. You really get to experience the eating culture there - crammed into small stalls along the lane serving mainly skewered food (they grill on demand!) and ramen. It's cramped but I really enjoyed the experience interacting with the locals. It's an after-work place and on the safer side on Shinjuku, no need to be worried about anythingHarajuku - A good place to experience Tokyo's gothic/lolita style fashion. One thing to beware of is that the place hires African men that look really burly and threatening (I don't think they mean any harm but still when a big guy approaches you sorta aggressively trying to sell their stuff it gets kinda uncomfortable)Asakusa Senso-ji - My second favourite temple/shrine place in Japan behind Fushimi Inari in Kyoto, it's usually quite crowded, but you can try going in the morning (like early morning reach there 6.30am) to beat the crowd and enjoy the place. The temple itself isn't open but the grounds are open 24/7. For me, I walked for a bit and took a train to the Tokyo Skytree. The sunrise in the area is pretty nice on a good day I must say.Yokohama - Yokohama is about an hour's train ride from central Tokyo, highly recommend checking out the port-side Minato Mirai at night/evening, the buildings give off sort of a futuristic feel (might just be me). Yokohama Chinatown is pretty cool also, but it might not be for everyone and it's rather small nglAny Taito Game Station - Try out the many arcade games they have - the variety is much larger than what we have in Singapore and perhaps be amazed at the raw skill of the Japanese rhythm game players - it's actually insane. Oh, and please don't waste money on claw machines it's not worth it.If you happen to be a photographer, I could tell you where some nice places are :)"
Wow thanks so much for this!! Really appreciate your time :-) you can be assured I’ll fit them into my 8 day itinerary! 🙏🏼
"You could probably cover all those in 2 days honestly, don't get lost while taking the trains - it's actually confusing for first-timers. There are some nicer places I've been to, but I'm pretty sure they're lowkey illegal so I'm not gonna recommend it (e.g Rooftopping; you get the point)."
I’ve been to Osaka before and yeah I agree. Got lost a few times. Which is why I’m trying to plan now beforehand! Yeah man illegal is not on my list; more of a casual tourist!
Honsstly it just comes down to what u really want to do!
"I got one, don't run down the streets clutching your backside shouting ""Geli! geli! geli!"""
Honestly feel that I've lost the ability to love and I'm very very scared because idk whether this is supposed to be normal

"I never really had that ability. Could you explain further what you mean? Like familial love or what? Love as in, a passion for something?"
"As in, to have feelings towards others eg.crushes or even not feeling that you love someone even though you're in a relationship."
hello! recommendations for london? planning a trip there soon so excited!!!
"Not going to list the usual tourist attractions like Buckingham Palace, St Paul's Cathedral etc since there's so much info already out there, but I think many are still worth a visit!FOOD: Lots of good food to be had in London! If you like steak and are going to have a splurge meal, I would recommend Hawksmoor. Their regular steaks are excellent and they do a great Sunday roast as well. The sides that I tried were really good too; what stands out most in my memory is this super sinful grilled bone marrow dish.MORE FOOD: Borough Market and Camden Market are both worth seeing, but make sure you check the opening days before you head down. Tbh I felt that a lot of the food there was just ok...not amazing but still worth trying. Basically like an atas pasar malam. Some stalls give free samples! Go with more people so you can try more food without burning a hole in your wallet lolSOUVENIRS: I second the Fortnum and Masons recommendation! In addition to the tea, their biscuits are really good. Think of Marks and Spencers in Singapore, but several levels up. I heard their high tea is good too, but I didn't manage to try it because we didn't book in advance. Incidentally, if you like M&S biscuits, they are generally much cheaper there.DAY TOURS: I did a couple of bus day tours to places like Stonehenge and Bath. If you do go for one, I would recommend against choosing one that packs 3-4 places into one day. You end up spending most of your time travelling and have less time on the ground. Also, if you want to visit the Harry Potter studio tour you should book your tickets asap.MUSICALS: All the big-name musicals have their own dedicated theatre, so if you're into musicals you can knock yourself out going to a different one every night.HISTORY: If you're a history buff, the Churchill War Rooms are really cool. It's basically the underground bunker where he and his staff worked during WWII. The Natural History Museum is cool if you want to see dinosaur fossils and entry is free!!! It gets really crowded so go early in the morning and on a weekday if you can. If you want to see Karl Marx's grave it's in one of the cemeteries, and Westminster Abbey has the tombs of tons of dead famous people too.NATURE: If the weather is good you can go to Hyde Park and just chill with the ducks for a while. I wanted to go to this cave complex called the Chislehurst Caves but I haven't yet. It sounds pretty cool though so maybe you can check them out!"
thanks! time to take out that google maps to do my mapping :D
"Oh nice, what are you keen on!If you like museums, I think the British museum is worth a visit and definitely a full day sort of affair. I allocated half a day and it wasn't really enough.If you're a foodie, you cannot miss out on going to Fortnum & Masons, even if it's just to window shop. Most things are amazing - the tea and alcohol are both amazing, and I've heard great things about the candy too. I've also bought a bunch of other British foodstuff, like mushroom ketchup and saucisson (really French, tbh).Hyde Park was definitely worth a stroll through, but as its barely spring I'm not sure how good it would look at the moment. For other touristy things, I definitely recommend taking a ferry from the London Eye/Big Ben-ish(which is under construction BTW), and up the river towards Tower Bridge and the Tower of London.Definitely think about checking out musicals too. The Book of Mormon is a crowd fave. Matilda is also a good bet."
hello! recommendations for london? planning a trip there soon so excited!!!
"I only spent less than 24 hrs in London on my last trip there, flew in, caught the lion king, then bread street pizza and duck and waffles then flew off to Italy the next morning."
"If you’re gonna catch one musical, I really recommend The Book of Mormon."
i've watched the book of morman at broadway already! hello my name is elder price and i would like to share with you this amazing book (Ding-Dong!)another one will be good!
Hamilton! Or maybe catch a play - Witness for the Prosecution is pretty exciting
RT pay need to go through some process to collect or does SAF just bank it to you straight up?
Bank in straight. You don't have to do anything unless you recently changed your bank account.
"I fucked up BEYOND belief today.I basically accidentally implied to a group of fellow volunteers that while I was happy to work with them I didn't necessarily see the need to be friends with them. (not those exact words, but that overall sentiment was probably quite clear).Fuuuuuuuuck."
"work is work, friends is friends. unless u elaborate i think nothing is wrong here. if i volunteer i treat my teammates as work too. we are gathering to forward a common cause."
"True enough. Well, I'm just glad that there are people out there who get it and I shouldn't lose sleep over it."
What's wrong with that sentiment? Sounds perfectly alright to me. (Volunteer) work is work. Friends are friends. They should be kept separate.
"I do agree. I just don't think I should have been broadcasting it to large groups of people like some awkward sociopath, especially as they're all in the same field of work as me."
Nah. People will understand. Unless they are like really young or something. It's not a big deal IMO. Many of them probably privately agree with you!
"Haha thanks. That's definitely making me feel better. I've been angsting about what feels like a social faux pas for the last couple hours, but in retrospect, probably nobody cares."
356 too
356 days to ord too!! Which coy were you from ?
Jiayousss
"How do you guys stay fresh and maintain personal hygiene in this hot and humid environment?Walking to the MRT and walking to school from the MRT nearby causes me to perspire a lot, which causes body odour. Its really annoying, imo, especially since I've just showered and changed into a fresh set of clothes. I use deodorant daily and apply a small amount under my armpits and on my shirt collar. I also take full showers in the morning. I'm not sure if my hyperhydrosis causes this, as I usually have clammy hands.Regardless, by the time I turn up for assembly, my back's usually drenched."
"For hyperhydrosis, have you tried Perspirex lotion on your hands? You can get it at any Watsons or Guardian outlet."
"apparently according to my friend who did ptp batch, when he lowered his salt intake, his sweat tastes like water. ymmv"
"• Liberal application of roll-on deodorant. Like several layers on the skin.• One of my friends carries a can of deodorant spray in his bag to spray all over his shirt if he has to travel in the sun and meet someone.• You might want to look at your choice of shirts as well. Are they made of natural fabric or synthetic fabric? According to BBC, polyester gets much smellier than natural fibres like cotton."
Well....you failed to plan.
Yeah it would seem kinda selfish
Why will it be selfish?
I feel like if you just message someone asking for help with important stuff without keeping contact for a long time the other party might feel like they're just being used

"Some activesg gyms have a ladies only area (for the weights etc, the treadmills and spin bikes are in the common area). Love it. Don't have to fight with so many guys for the equipment, ladies come in all shapes and sizes and I feel it's a very non judgemental, comfortable place most of the time. Activesg gyms are also q cheap too, and not v crowded if you can wake up early enough."
which gyms !
"the one near pioneer mrt (jurong west sports centre) has too! not sure about other activesg gyms. hmm seems like something they would write on their website or sth, but i guess not. the pioneer gym is pretty big and has quite a lot of equipment. even when it's ~30% full on the gym tracker, i never really feel it's crowded. but i guess the location can be quite inconvenient if you don't stay nearby"
the one at pasir ris has a female corner! but it's closed for reno till 16 march
Is turning on the reading light in cars illegal?Just wondering
"Do you mean while driving? Cant remember if it is illegal or not, but you definitely DONT wanna do that while driving. If the inside of the car is brighter than the surroundings outside, it is very difficult to see what's happening outside. You then become a hazard to yourself as well as to others. Do it only when you are parked safely and not while driving."
Is it feasible to join the French foreign legion right after NS?
I wonder is there any Singaporean that is a legion over there
yes after that they will kick you out because of an injury and u will heal with a mage and then waking up as a Witcher
Definitely. But the moment you leak secrets I'm coming for your ass boi
Doing it for the career or for the citizenship there? Had a cousin that tried that.However he left after a while cause he felt lonely while recuperating after suffering from a nasty injury
That's interesting. What made him go for it?
"Unlike most singaporeans, I think he really liked the idea of military life, wanted to be a para trooper or something.Too bad he quit though, would've loved to hear stories about the shenanigans our military counterparts would do."

Do you have the correct address? Do you have anyone else's number for those who are going?

"That's really strange. Sounds like a prank honestly, but I have no idea why they would do that."
You wait 1 hr liao still waiting? Respect
"Haha yeahh it was in the east and pouring rain so i kinda caught a cold alr, but I'll head there again to see in an hour's time! If still nobody answer, then I'll just give some generic not feeling well excuse if I see them next time :("
Why do you have to give an excuse when it's not your fault?..
"Idk just feelsbad since it was like a hotpot party and they might have prepared my share of food but I didnt turn up in the end? Welp, trying again later anyways since I know there's a few ppl coming straight after their work's done!"
update us!
"Oops, never went afterwards because I caught a high fever! :((("
"not sure if this is the right place to ask, but are there any hots players here?"
"Same, not often but sill get a couple games in here and there.Waiting for Total War: Three Kingdoms!!"
Not as often anymore but i do drop by once in awhile for quest to get gold and try new heroes that im interested in.
I really like going for a pee when everyone is busy buzzing around outside. Much zenEdit:outside
I just started watching and it's darker than I thought ^ ^
Same. However I'm watching Kingdom although it has only 6 episodes now.
"Sometimes i wish my friends watched similar movies as i so i can talk to them about itSo here I am, just watched Beasts of no nations. Damn that movie hit me like a truck outta nowhere.spoilers ahead, the scene where Agu goes ""sun, why are you shining on this world"", god damn. man this movies has so many great lines."
"Hey there, what kind of movies do you like? Got a list of your personal favorites?I love Beasts of No Nation as well. I think it's one of Idris Elba's best performance and the child actor is phenomenal as well. The portrayal of how violence and brutality is passed on and affects the innocent is heart wrenching indeed.If you like that I'd recommend giving First They Killed My Father a watch as well. It's not as 'wow' as Beasts of No Nation but I feel the general sentiment is echoed in that as well. City of God is another amazing film but rather than depicting the struggles of war it revolves around a group of kids who grow up in a crime infested city and how they ultimately become a part of it."
"Personal favorites from the top of my head Interstellar, 12 Angry men, The Prestige, Whiplash, La la Land, Zodiac, Spotlight and Gone girlCompletely agree with you and I'll give your recommendations a try!"
"I see you're quite a fan of Nolan, Chazelle, and Fincher. Have you seen Nolan's Memento yet? It's one of my personal favorites from him. For Fincher, I think that Fight Club is still his magnum opus. Have you seen Chazelle's First Man yet?My own personal list of favorites are: 2001: A Space Odyssey, Stalker, Synecdoche New York, Tokyo Story, Peronsa, and Mulholland Drive. If you don't have it already, letterboxd is great for keeping track of what films you've seen. Here's my profile if you're curious."
"Haven't seen Memento yet. Kinda put off on it for quite, maybe I'll get to it soon. And to be frank I find that I enjoyed Gone girl, or other Fincher's l films more than fight club, though I can understand why you find it to be his magnum opus.And yes I've seen First man in the theatre but couldn't keep up with all the characters so it didn't stand out to me. That said the landing scene and spinning scene was real good. Especially the soundtrack during the landing scene, it was perfect.And man it's real nice talking to you! will check out the website and some of your favorites for sure, though it's my first time hearing all those titles."
"Always nice to find another lover of movies! Speaking of Chazelle, I think Whiplash is still his best movie, followed by La La Land. I'd say that First Man is more impressive on a technical level. Maybe I'm biased because I saw it in IMAX though.I feel like you might enjoy Kubrick (The Shining, 2001, A Clockwork Orange, etc.) so you can check his films out as well."
"Couldn't agree more with you, part of the reason was also because J.K Simmons acting was really something else.Chazelle's film's endings is what always gets me, they're so intense. The build up/mid story takes awhile but the payoff is def worth it. Sometimes the ending feels more like the climax, like in Whiplash and First man. The only exception was La la Land, I usually don't dig musical movies but im glad I pushed through it for the first 15mins or soAnd I'm definitely saving all these post and watching some of your recommendations, thanks and appreciate it!"
ok im convinced to watch it now
Contract ending in 3 months and I'm overwhelmed with trying to find a new job. No idea if going into social work or teaching is a good idea since it means going back to study again.
If that's what you really want go for it! All the best!
Teaching is crazy stressful. You can ask those who are teachers... but not saying that social work isn't stressful either.
if that’s what u like then it’s ok!! chase ur dreams!
Thanks for the encouragement. It means a lot when my parents are against me doing either of them.

"Last week and I'm buying some milk in a cold storage, I see a grandpa keep looking at the 1L strawberry milk, but then he take the smallest one. Really sad 😢. My conscience keep telling me to do something, but I didn't. I should have treat him."
"Yea, it could well be him thinking if he really needs that much."
"I always look longingly at the 500ml six pack of beer but end up only buy the 300ml six pack. If only a nice kid like you were there to treat me.No need so drama lah, my guess is that grandpa was thinking about whether the milk will expire before he can finish."
so correct!
Maybe he was thinking he cannot drink so much because it's sweet.

I moved into my apartment last month and ever since there has been a steady flow of Technicians and Plumbers coming in to fix numerous leaks and problems that have arisen. I’m getting quite frustrated with this and feel like the place isn’t in tenantable condition as the contract stipulates that it should be.Is there anything I can do about this?What is the definition of “tenantable condition”?Edit: some of the problems I identified before we moved in and I was promised they would be fixed by the time we moved in. They still have not been.
If the repair commitment was included in tenancy agreement then you can go to consumer court.
"New building or no?If it's more than 1 year old. it's your own duty to keep it in conditionIf not, find the contractor(which I think you have)Other than that if they refuse to assist you, can escalate to HDB.If they did assist, but keep cannot solve, idk lol."
It’s a landed property and I’m renting a floor.
"Ah then it's under the person renting it to you, which I think you already know according to your post. I'm not sure about matters regarding responsibility before renting."
That’s okay :) thank you for trying!

"This is GreenPeace Rainbow Warrior III https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Warrior_(2011)The vessel sunk was Rainbow Warrior, that vessel was scuttled in 1987. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_Rainbow_Warrior"
"Rainbow Warrior (2011)Rainbow Warrior (sometimes Rainbow Warrior III) is a purpose-built motor-assisted sailing yacht owned and operated by Greenpeace and intended for use in their activities such as environmental protests and scientific excursions. She was christened on October 14, 2011, and has replaced Rainbow Warrior II after further upgrades and maintenance of the older ship had been shown to be impractical.The vessel is the first Rainbow Warrior that is not converted from another vessel. Her Hull was constructed in Poland and she was built in Germany, to provide state of the art facilities for the group's use, including advanced telecommunication equipment, specialised scientific equipment and a helicopter landing pad. The ship is also designed to be one of the ""greenest"" ships afloat, and to showcase this quality, it runs primarily using wind power, with a 55 m mast system which carries 1255 sq meters of sail and is backed up by a ""state-of-the-art hybrid"".Sinking of the Rainbow WarriorThe sinking of the Rainbow Warrior, codenamed Opération Satanique, was a bombing operation by the ""action"" branch of the French foreign intelligence services, the Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure (DGSE), carried out on 10 July 1985. During the operation, two operatives sank the flagship of the Greenpeace fleet, the Rainbow Warrior, at the Port of Auckland in New Zealand on its way to a protest against a planned French nuclear test in Moruroa. Fernando Pereira, a photographer, drowned on the sinking ship.France initially denied responsibility, but two French agents were captured by New Zealand Police and charged with arson, conspiracy to commit arson, willful damage, and murder.[ ^PM | Exclude ^me | Exclude from ^subreddit | FAQ / ^Information | ^Source ] Downvote to remove | v0.28"

"Hi guys, I'm feeling emotionally drained and I just need an outlet to vent.My mom body shames me and I'd like to believe she does not do it intentionally. So please do not attack her here. I'm not asking for that, I just need an outlet to express my feelings.It all started when i suffered from an episode of UTI and yeast infection 3 years ago where it left an unhealthy odor on the pants and underwear I wear. When she ""smelled it"" she proclaimed it loudly at home that my pants smell horrible of my vagina, even in front of my dad.. Which made me feel very uncomfortable at that point. I have since recovered and I no longer smell.But ever since that episode, she would tell me to habd wash my pants once first before throwing it into the laundry. Her reason for this is because she still thinks my pants will smell of my vagina. Which I told her it does not because I know I have recovered.But as time goes by.. Her actions have taken a toll on my mental well-being and I've started thinking something is really wrong with me. I've been to the gynae 6 times. Each time they would say I'm perfectly healthy underneath but it does not convince me. I still feel like something is wrong with my vagina.I am also unable to confidently have sex with my bf because of this mental block and I feel super conscious about my 'smell' during sex. My bf says he has never smelled anything funny and assures me that there is no nasty smell but my mind is set that something is wrong with my nether regions.I feel embarrassed, ashamed and disgusted by my vagina and it's pressuring the fuck out of me to the point that when someone is sitting down and I walk past them, I wonder if they ""smell"" me.This morning my mom did it again. When I woke up and went to the shower she reminded me to wash the pants I wore to sleep before throwing it in the laundry.I felt so so so disgusted with myself and my body in the shower that I cried.I'm not sure what is the point of my posting this here but I guess i really just needed an outlet to vent. Thanks for taking the time to read this.Edit: wow this really blew up. Thanks for all the supportive comments guys. I'm feeling better now. For the record, I do wash my own underwear and sports attire. I'm perfectly agreeable to that because it makes sense to not contaminate other clothings with your bodily fluids. What bugs me is that my mom specifically only ask me (not my sister) to wash my pants, any pants, jeans, shorts, skorts, regardless (even when I'm wearing panty liners). It's like her way of saying ""you, of all of us, are exceptionally dirty"". That bugs me so much and cripples my self-esteem. Many of you seem to think I'm referring to my underwear, I'm not. It's the outer pants."
"U are not alone. My mum body shames a lot me since I was young too. Said my face is too big, teeth too yellowish, always comment on my overjet, too short (always compare my height to others) etc etc. That’s why I’ve always have a complex for many parts of my body, till the point that I want a plastic surgery. It’s very mentally exhausting for me because I wouldn’t even care so much about my appearance if she hadn’t been commenting on my appearance for years"
"The crazy thing is all these things she's nitpicking on arent even your fault, theyre hers and your dad's. Overbites, height and face shape are all genetic so it's stupid to shame your own child about all these traits which arent even bad or unattractive anyway.Parents arent infalliable, and although its hard you should try to ignore all this negativity."
"As a man, I don’t really understand the double standard over the scrutiny of appearance."
"This must be fucking frustrating. You can cut out toxic friends but a toxic mom is a nightmare.It may be useful to consider talking to her about how you feel , and about how it affects you. How do you think she might respond?"
I'm not sure how she'll respond but I'm not sure how to start the conversation with her either. The words get stuck at my throat every single time.
"It can't be easy talking about something that has been emotionally affecting you for such a long time. You do write pretty well though, maybe you could write it in a letter?"
"Have you tried telling your mum how you felt every time she makes those comments? I’m sure if you told her that because of her hurtful words that you felt so terrible, she might stop. I’m sure no Mother would intentionally hurt their child like this, perhaps she doesn’t know how much it’s affecting you? Hope you stay strong! You’re gonna be okay OP :)"
There were a few occasions I did want to speak up about my feelings but I didn't have the courage to actually do it. Mental well-being and private parts aren't really the easiest things to discuss with Asian parents.
"You are not alone, even though I’m a guy, my dad shames me in front of other guys. Especially so when I was younger. while I was at the swimming pool, he would gather the other males and laugh/ridicule me for not wanting to change in the open.What I had to do, was to learn to be confident and not let others affect your well being. We are in control of our emotions and mental state. No one else, but ourselves should be able to affect us."
"Girl... you need to do a one on one with her and talk about it. Close the room and lock it if you have to. Sometimes people are dumb, especially parents, I’m a very good example of one. You need to get it off your chest and she needs to know she’s hurting her daughter. When you ignore or pretend it doesn’t hurt you she’s taking it at face value and will keep going.No mama is out to hurt her kid. She’s focusing on a thing and forgotten her baby needs love and support like everyone else. I hope you feel better."
Have courage! It won’t be easy but it’ll help her to understand. Good luck!
Say this in her face“麻！你可以不要每天隐射我有超级白吗？” “我男朋友吃过了，他说很好吃，不信你问他”Then see you mom cringe in horror

"One common UTI three years ago and mum is still obsessed about it? She needs to do some reading on reproductive health and get educated. Also, she needs to know that smelling your underwear is not exactly a normal thing to do.She is causing a deterioration of your own mental health and now you have obsessive thoughts about the state of your vagina. It is like how some females get eating disorders after being body shamed constantly.You need to sit her down and tell her to stop this and why."
Go smell hers and tell her hers is worse.
After all she came out of her vagina. If there’s something she should know better...
+1. gotta stoop to her level and fk her upside down then return to ur level
"Sounds to me like you haven’t moved on from the initial incident yet and that the repetitive reminders and ritualistic washing has deepened the shame and slowed down your recovery.There’s a discrepancy between what you know (6 gynaes and a partner have give you a clean review) and what you feel. Speaking from experience, it usually takes a while before your emotional responses catch up with reality — but without a doubt, a repetitive cleaning ritual doesn’t help.Others have suggested moving out, which I don’t think is realistic given the finances involved and the severe strain it places on family relations. Worse still, if you’re asian.You need to have an honest but difficult conversation with your mum, and tell her that her behaviour is causing a great deal of mental anguish and anxiety about yourself — enough that you’re extremely self-conscious in public. You might like to reach out to understand her frustration as well: Does she really smell something or is she just venting because she’s the only one doing laundry? Engage her and ask her to brainstorm for solutions with you so that you both leave the conversation with a healthy way forward.If that doesn’t work, let’s say, if she were to turn hostile. Well, at least you’d tried. You might like to just do your laundry yourself to avoid triggering her hurtful comments. Intuitively, it seems like there might be other underlying issues that make it difficult for you to have an open conversation with your mum. That’s fine, just workaround the best you can to avoid having her repeat her hurtful comments.Btw I wash my own soiled undies and exercise clothes because I really wish to avoid triggering off my mum’s epic rants about colours, smells and the potential contamination of other laundry, too.Hope this helps!"
"Thank you so much for this. It really isn't easy to speak up about such an issue with your mom (especially as an asian!) For the record, I do wash my own underwear and sports attire. I'm perfectly agreeable to that because it makes sense to not contaminate other clothings with your bodily fluids. What bugs me is that my mom specifically only ask me (not my sister) to wash my pants, any pants, jeans, shorts, skorts, regardless (even when I'm wearing panty liners). It's like her way of saying ""you, of all of us, are exceptionally dirty"". That bugs me so much and cripples my self-esteem."
"Yea I understand, it feels like she’s singling you out.... that’s rough, babe, hang in there. Really hope you find a way to remove yourself from the cyclical reminders.In my house, mum’s rants have gone from being a thorn in our sides to a laughable fatal flaw that we accept — “Oh, mum’s having a rant again. Whose clothes was it this time? Hurhurhur.” My dad and siblings all suffer her but now, 15 years later and at the age of 29, we think it’s a joke. Even though in my early 20’s, I have to say that her prying into my dirty laundry felt like an invasion of privacy."
"You’ve been to the gynae 6 times and been told that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with your lady parts. Have you told your mum that? And that her constant reminders are severely affecting your confidence? If she truly cares about you, she should stop doing so.If she doesn’t stop assuming the worst of you, you’re going to have to start ignoring her comments. Tell yourself you’re responsible and have ensured proper hygiene of your lady parts. Cuz unfortunately, when it comes to parents who may mean well but overdo the criticizing, one should prioritize their own mental health and ignore them when it’s clearly unwarranted."
Most of the time I do a pretty good job at blocking the comments out. But I guess me breaking down in the shower this morning kinda showed me how much her comments do affect me as much as I tell myself to ignore them...
"If you're distressed by these thoughts, you might want to seek professional assistance i.e psychotherapy. It's quite common for this to happen especially in the young female demographic. Sometimes our worries and concerns get the better of us even if we know rationally that they are not quite true. And if you're having issues feeling better, professional help could be useful.If you're still on followup with your Gyn, you can let them know that these worries are distressing you (I'd imagine if you have attended 6 times with a clean bill of health, they might already have an inkling of it). Alternatively if you want a subsidized referral you can go to polyclinic.https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&client=ms-android-samsung-gs-rev1&source=android-browser&q=body+dysmorphic+disorderGood luck!"
"Be strong dear redditor. When it comes to your lady parts, your bf's opinion is most important right? But maybe can bring up to your mother that she is being abusive and maybe convince her not to be such an unpleasant person."
"My mother body shames me sometimes too... It affected my self-esteem a lot while growing up. Mothers can be really toxic tbh.Anyways, I agree with the other comments; you should talk to your mother about it. And I probably should too hahaha"
Maybe ask her to accompany you to gynae next and let the gynae explain to her as well?
"Nothing is wrong with you girl. If talking to her doesn’t work, just separate and do your own laundry. It’s a big F U to your mom for all the harassments."
How old are you? Time to get rid of her by moving out.
"hey OP, i have a toxic mum too that does something similar. Maybe you can try to wash your own undergarments and pants just to get your mum off your back? About your mum embarrassing you verbally, from my experience I used to hit back and insult her equally. That shut her up pretty quickly. But I’ve learned to live with verbal insults so i just try to not internalise them and ignore them the best i can.UTIs are really common so you don’t have to worry. You can try feminine body wash if you’re still concerned about the smell."
"I do wash my own undergarments. But pants wise, she washes everyone's pants in the household so why should I be an exception? I feel like me accepting that I have to wash my own pants is acknowledging her opinion that there is something wrong down there. I'm not sure if that is going to make me feel any better honestly."
"I keep a separate laundry basket in my room. I've been doing my own laundry for the past 4 years though my mum helps me iron my business shirts (I'm terrible at that). I think it can be done, especially if there's a laundromat near your place. I think it'll also help if you matter-of-factly tell your mum that you'll take over your own laundry since the smell offends her, and you don't want to subject her delicate nostrils to that.Edited to add: Also, let your laundry be the first step in separating your life from theirs. Do your own laundry. Pay your own bills. Cook/prepare your own food. If you give them money every month, consider it ""rent."" If this is the guy you want to marry, start listening to your BF and place what he says over what your mum says. Be obvious about it if you want, you can't be any less obvious than your mum. If your BF were to do what your mum is doing he'd probably be out on his ear, why should she be any different?"
"Hi OP~writing just so you don't feel so alone, My mom makes me do my own laundry as well, she says women's clothing should not mix with men's, or my undies will jinx my brothers' good fortune. 🙄"
🤦🏻‍♀️
"No, you washing your own pants is just removing point of conflict.It’s like someone irritating you, it’s your right to stay and fight but moving away is also a reasonable conflict resolution if you don’t wish to fight.End of the day it’s up to you how you wanna resolve the conflict. If you don’t want to confront your mum then doing your own laundry is a good solution. Alternatively is you reason with your mum which will have varied results.What won’t work is you continuing to have your mum do your laundry and then having to endure her snide remarks and then you feeling miserable.Being right has nothing to do with conflict resolution other than your pride or sense of justice. Sometimes it’s better to just be the bigger person to walk away."
"Hey, i would like to thank you for this much needed insight on how a woman would feel. I was a douche bag whom complained about this issue with my ex. I didn’t know how she would have felt.I feel that there’s no need to seek further remedies anymore, the doctor has said that you’re perfectly fine. Have faith and trust the Doctors, they underwent numerous years of studies and seen numerous patients. If it was something serious they would know, and you would be taking treatment already."
You complained about how your ex smelled?
"I’ve always thought that she didn’t care about her health or her hygiene, I was totally blindsided about her feelings, and what happens in the back scene how I was important to her and how my remarks would make her feel.I don’t deserve her, I failed her. One of my life hardest lesson."

"Just say ""no it's not dirty"". If she insists it is, then insist that it isn't. If she still insists, move out."
"I do that sometimes. But me refusing to wash it is just merely an act of evasion. It doesn't stop her comments from getting to me. This morning was a great example, she reminded me to wash it but I said No, I'm not doing it. I didn't do it but instead, i wad crying to myself in the shower and feeling disgusted about my body."
"Then tell her to never say it again because it hurts you. She's probably oblivious.Ultimately you can't control another person's behaviour. Either you persuade her to stop, you learn to be unaffected, you move out, or you continue to suffer."
"My mom tells me i'm fat all the time lol. I'm a guy of average height under 60kg...You can't always stop the world from saying what they will say. You've to find a way to not care that works for you. A lot of us like going on the offensive, as you can tell from the comments...edit: just walked past her and she commented on my poor complexion so many pimples etc."
"This might come off as insensitive, but I think you just gotta learn to live with it and have thicker skin. If your mom saying your pants stink cripple your pride so much, I'm worried what the outside world will do to you.In any case, a clear and easy recourse would be to show your mother your pants dont stink anymore..? not tell her, but literally show her the proof?"
One’s birther can most often cause more psychological damage than strangers from “the outside world”.
It's the norm rather than the exception
"This is really helpful in more than one way. Hope OP reads this one again.To break it down.learn to manage and control your emotions.learn how to communicate, confront, debate, discuss."
"As someone mentioned earlier, you should tell your mum how you feel.If she still continues giving those comments, then you'll just have to let her words bounce off your face.First of all, you should value your own opinion more than anyone else's opinion of you. Secondly, there's already a professional opinion from the doctor. And thirdly, your boyfriend didn't find anything wrong. Your mum's opinion don't really rank anywhere near importance."
"Just throw your pants in the laundry without washing them first. If she can't tell you didn't wash them, then there is no reason they need to be washed."
"I understand that this is difficult, but I feel like the only solution is to tell your mother how you feel about this. Even if you did go for therapy, the root cause of the problem - your mother body shaming you - would still be there. Tell her firmly that you feel as though she's singling you out, that it's not funny, and that if she continues to do this she would be a bad mother.That is, unfortunately, what she is being now. No mother should do this to their child."
"Just a recommendation, if you don’t really want to confront your mum about it, maybe a solution is for you to start doing you own separate laundry instead of pooling with the rest of your family.If your mum is not allowing you to use the washer/dryer, can consider using those self service laundromat which is sprouting everywhere nowadays.Yes it will be more troublesome but it will be worth it for your sanity. Alternatively consider moving out soon."
"I get nagged about body odour, considering I sweat easily, making some of the clothes I wear targets for criticism of being ""too thick"". It does make sense, but I wish the nagging would be toned down so I don't feel guilty about wearing certain clothes I like. Ps I know full well to use deodorant btw"
time to get married and move out.
"I wouldn't take it too much to heart if i were you. It sounds like it's just an asian mom thing. I'm 154cm and 50kg and my mom keeps saying i'm overweight. I'm not, but i do know i will be soon if i dont watch out, and i am watching my diet very closely. My mom also says my hair smells weird, my feet are weirdly shaped, i'm too short, my hair is too coarse, on and on and on. I've since learned to tune out all these remarks because they're unfounded and even if they are there is nothing i can do.Remember, there is nothing wrong with you. The gynaes have spoken. You are perfect the way you are ❤❤"

"My mum used to tell us to wash our own underwear once we hit a certain age. With young male teens, I can see why it’s kind of disgusting with all sorts of stains and what not."

"TILSingaporean Tells of Khmer Rouge AidBy MICHAEL RICHARDSON and INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNESEPT. 29, 2000SINGAPORE— China, the United States, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand spent more than $1.3 billion in a largely secret program in the 1980s to support Khmer Rouge and non-Communist guerrillas in Cambodia fighting Vietnamese troops and allied Cambodian forces, the Singaporean senior minister, Lee Kuan Yew, has disclosed in his memoirs.The program was opposed by the U.S. Congress because lawmakers objected to moves to aid the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge was driven from Phnom Penh by a Vietnamese-led invasion in January 1979 after a reign of terror and forced labor that lasted nearly four years and killed more than 1 million people.The administration of President Ronald Reagan was persuaded to support the ultimately successful effort to get Vietnam to withdraw from Cambodia in September 1989 so that elections under United Nations supervision could be held for a new government. The elections were held in 1993 but were boycotted by the Khmer Rouge.American, Singaporean, Malaysian and Thai officials held regular meetings in Bangkok to coordinate the Cambodian aid program, Mr. Lee wrote in his book, ""From Third World to First: The Singapore Story 1965-2000,"" which went on sale Sept. 16.He said the Singapore representative ""estimated that the United States dispensed a total of about $150 million in covert and overt aid to the non-Communist groups, Singapore $55 million, Malaysia $10 million and Thailand a few million in training, ammunition, food and operational funds.""But Mr. Lee said those amounts were dwarfed by aid from China, which had long had antagonistic relations with Vietnam and sought to prevent Hanoi from turning Cambodia into a satellite state. Beijing spent ""some $100 million"" to support the non-Communist forces fighting alongside the Khmer Rouge to expel the Vietnamese, he wrote, and ""10 times that amount on the Khmer Rouge.""""As it turned out, the Soviet Union was bleeding from the war in Afghanistan and its massive aid to Vietnam, Ethiopia, Angola and Cuba,"" Mr. Lee added. ""By the late 1980s, Soviet aid had stopped and Vietnam was in economic difficulties; it had an inflation rate of above 1,000 percent in 1988 and a food crisis. It had to get out of Cambodia.""About 10 years later, the end of fighting, along with the splintering of the Khmer Rouge and the integration of its fighters into the national army, has left Cambodia with a bloated military that has consumed almost half the annual budget in recent years.The coalition government of Prime Minister Hun Sen has estimated the cost of cutting the army to 55,000 soldiers from an official level of 148,000 early last year, and the police to 24,000 from 60,000, at more than $154 million, for such things as severance payments, training, land grants and other support.The World Bank has drawn up a demobilization program that would pare the army by 30,000, to around 100,000 troops, over the next three years. The World Bank has appealed to foreign governments that provide more than $500 million in annual aid to Cambodia to commit funds to downsizing the military by the end of October at the latest.It estimates that the three-year program will cost no more than $45 million, with $7.2 million being paid by the Cambodian government and the remaining money coming from foreign donors.""We must provide a long-term means of livelihood for demobilized troops so that they will not become a security risk, for example by resorting to crime and banditry,"" the chief of the World Bank office in Phnom Penh, Bonaventure Mbida-Essama, said in an interview.More info:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian–Vietnamese_War"
"Misleading title. Read the article closelyHe said the Singapore representative ""estimated that the United States dispensed a total of about $150 million in covert and overt aid to the non-Communist groups, Singapore $55 million, Malaysia $10 million and Thailand a few million in training, ammunition, food and operational funds.""You can read the next paragraph and the article's first paragraph to do the math.Also, article is old and only confuses people by not explaining the context of the situation. Asean opposed the Vietnamese invasion because it broke international law. At the same time no one except China liked the Khmer Rouge and appearing to support them internationally wasn't good optics. So they worked behind the scenes to unite 2 non-communist factions with the Khmer Rouge into a single coalition - that way they could sell it as a united Cambodian resistance, not a Khmer Rouge one. Most of the aid went to the non-communist factions so they could fight the Vietnamese, and so that they could stand a fighting chance against the Khmer Rouge when the Vietnamese eventually withdrew"
"Yeah, on hindsight, Cambodia was a nothing burger. Its economy and population was totally ruined by the Khmer Rouge so occupying the land would do the Vietnamese no good. Russia was descending into its own economic woes so aid to Vietnam was not as forthcoming.To me, it is a sad page in SG's ""secret"" history that we actually helped a murderous regime such as the Khmer Rouge."
"I was a little bit surprised (shocked?). I’ve always been told how anti-communist the PAP was, arresting them and etc but this is another level."
Hmm sea was more worried about Vietnam than Cambodia.Also the policy of non interference in asean country
"Have to consider internal security and ""the international situation"" separately, just as we have to now. A destabilised sg is bad for sgporeans but outsiders typically won't give a hoot. A destabilised regions is bad for sg and we have to play along with allies."
"But why a regime that’s practically causing their own holocaust? Why wouldn’t Vietnam have been the better option?Why the need to choose a side anyway; they’re both communist? Is it because of the alleged US backing of the Khmers? It’s “alleged” though, so I’m not too sure about the accuracy of the source."
The Thais were freaking out. The Malaysians to a lesser extent. Imagine a united VN-Cambodia-Laos communist bloc as your neighbour.
"Imagine a united VN-Cambodia-Laos communist bloc as your neighbour.Weren’t the Vietnamese invading Cambodia?Or do you mean what happens after they invade and install their own pro-Vietnamese (still communist) government in Cambodia?I’m confused; it sounds like the funding was pointless. Before, communist, after, still communist. Only difference was who. Am I wrong?"
"Important to note here that there was a significant split amongst the communists in Cambodia (supported by the Chinese) and the communists in Vietnam (supported by USSR) at this point.On one hand, you have the Vietnamese whom the US and its allies in Southeast Asia perceived to have expansionistic intentions at the point of time. They had the aim to unify Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos) under a common banner as well as subsequently spread this throughout Southeast Asia. By 1977, they had already controlled Laos through a puppet government and looked to be doing the same in Cambodia during their invasion in 1978.Comparatively, you have the Khmer Rouge regime which was much less of a threat to its neighbours and stood as a bulwark against Vietnamese expansionism. Not to mention that Cambodia was supported by the Chinese who at this point in the Cold War was growing closer to the US and its allies and becoming increasingly opposed to the USSR.So to your question, while both are communist regimes, the threat of expansionism being posed by both was decidedly different for their neighbours at the point. There's a reason why Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore were the key supporters for the regime. If you look at the Southeast Asia map, once Cambodia falls, those are the three key countries that come immediately under threat of invasion next."
I sometimes feel people here don't remember how crazy it was living in the cold war era.
"Yeah, I mean the imagined aftermath with VN controlling Cambodia and Laos through puppet regimes."

man MOHs IT really is a flaming cesspool eh
"I wonder if this is just MOH IT that is horrible, or if a lot of government systems are horrible and MOH is just suay.Either way, doesn't bode well for us. Guess we all need to learn not to entrust our data and record to others."
It's not just MOH IT.We are directly affected by these MOH's problems so we know about them.
All the same CECA + underpaid contract agency workers from same vendor NC$ / ST.Not just MOH...
Nowonder career fairs they hiring so many IT staff lol
Smart Nation leh.
"Seriously, so much news about software errors and digital issues.SmArT nAtIoN"
"Oh another thing involving MOH, they seem to be down on their luck recently. Good that MOH is not making those who received excess subsidies, through no fault of their own, pay back the subsidies."
When you push CHAS blue to your rich friends in GCBs need to find a way to cover up.
I’m still not sure I can trust NCS / NEHR / MOH with my medical data
"Nobody should have access to too much of your data, doesn't matter if its private sector or public sector, Facebook or MOH"
I understand where you're coming from as an individual but providing healthcare professionals with data is immensely useful in order to provide opportunities for machine learning to cluster data which could be used to narrow down the reason why a certain disease affects a subset of the population or even to diagnose diseases such as calculating the risk of a tumour being malignant or benign based on a variety of factors
"Do we have an option? As far as I know, MOH has not decided whether our data will still be stored in the database if we opt out. Will hackers be more interested in these data?"
NEHR is by Accenture not NCS la.https://www.accenture.com/t20170518T051457__w__/sg-en/_acnmedia/PDF-51/Accenture-Health-Electronic-Health-Records-Case-Study.pdfCHAS is by NCS and different system from NEHR.
"7,700 Singaporeans received inaccurate CHAS subsidies due to software error: MOHSINGAPORE: An error in the computer system administered by NCS caused about 7,700 individuals to receive inaccurate healthcare and intermediate- and long-term care subsidies, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Saturday (Feb 16).The affected individuals are among those whose applications or renewals of their Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) cards were processed from Sep 18 to Oct 10 last year.AdvertisementThe error arose in the computer system when it calculated means-test results.The means-test system calculates the healthcare subsidies which individuals are eligible for, based on their income information. Healthcare subsidies are means-tested so that greater financial support is extended to lower-income households.""The means-test and subsidy tiers for all affected individuals have been corrected by Feb 16, 2019,” MOH said.MOH said no proactive action is required on the part of the affected people at this point. The ministry added that it is working closely with healthcare service providers and scheme administrators to reach out to those affected.AdvertisementAdvertisement“About 1,300 individuals who received lower subsidies will have the difference reimbursed to them.“Another 6,400 individuals received higher subsidies due to the error but will not need to return the additional subsidies disbursed,” MOH added.The first case of discrepancy in the means-test results of a CHAS cardholder was detected by the CHAS processing team on Sep 24, 2018 and NCS was alerted immediately, MOH said.“The issue was initially attributed to intermittent network connection problems. Five more cases were subsequently detected between Oct 9 and Nov 2, and a more thorough investigation was initiated,” added the health ministry.In late November, NCS traced the root cause of the discrepancies to a software version issue on a server used by the means-test system when it was migrated to another government data centre in September.“This resulted in the means-test results being computed without the requisite income information. NCS further discovered that their deployment team had in fact fixed the software version issue earlier on Oct 10, 2018 in response to an unrelated slow performance issue.“This stopped further cases of errors but it did not correct the means-test results that had been generated from Sep 18, 2018 to Oct 10, 2018,” MOH said.CORRECT SUBSIDY TIERS RESTORED BY FEB 16MOH said that it worked with NCS from December to establish the extent of the impact, including the correct subsidy tiers for each individual under the different services and schemes. This was to determine who could have received higher or lower subsidies than what they were eligible for.The final assessment was completed on Jan 14 and MOH worked with grant scheme administrators and healthcare institutions to finalise the remedial action plans, including how affected individuals will be informed and reimbursed.The correct subsidy tiers of all affected individuals were restored by Feb 16.Service providers and scheme administrators will now progressively inform the affected individuals and arrange for reimbursements where applicable.“We expect all the affected individuals to be informed by mid-March 2019,” MOH said.MOH said that NCS has acknowledged the error and has taken further remedial action by tightening the system deployment processes.“Additional safeguards have been put in place to prevent any recurrence of such incidents. NCS has reiterated its commitment to being held to the highest standards as a service provider.MOH takes a serious view of the incident, and has worked with NCS on appropriate remedial measures. MOH will work with NCS on measures to prevent such errors in the future,” the ministry stated.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"
MOH and MINDEF can’t catch a break eh?
"6,400 got more $$$ (one time only) And those whom received less $$$ will get more.Like striking 4D, late payout."
Well done! I just wonder how much of testing they did before implementing it?
"Well not all company hire tester/hacker to test their system. A developer can also do testing but is probably not the standard of what a professional software tester do. After all, the breath of knowledge may be there but not the depth."
"I thought it'll be interesting to hear some opinions.For modern designs, I have a huge architecture boner for parkview square. Art decor is sick, its classy yet not overly obnoxious, it feels like a timeless design. Reminds me alot about bioshock, and its the place I love to bring foreign friends to admire the design.Classical will be the rainbow peranakan houses along joo chiat. Its like our version of painted ladies from SF, and its so symmetrical as wellUnpopular opinion, while a marvel, I don't think that MBS looks that amazing. Honestly I prefer the Jewel over MBS, like its three weird towers with a boat on top."
"Brutalist: The Concourse, OCBC Centre, Jurong Town Hall, Singapore Science Centre. Just a few brutalist buildings that are really exemplary of function over form imo.Residential: Pinnacle@Duxton, The Interlace, DUO Residences. The Interlace is really underrated - it supports 1000 units built in the form of stacked jenga bricks which should really deserve more spotlights. Pinnacle@Duxton has rooftop gardens and cool sky bridges linking each residential block, so it isn't surprising for the project to win a couple of awards. DUO Residences is also on my list simply because it has a pretty slick design and the hexagonal facade just screams the hell that is organic chemistry lolModernism: Robinson Tower, Tanjong Pagar Centre, ParkRoyal Hotel, Oasia Hotel, The Sail@Marina Bay. Robinson Tower, designed by the folks at Kohn Pedersen Fox (also the guys behind Shanghai WFC and Hong Kong ICC), blends an indoor garden and office and retail space really nicely, something which a majority of office buildings lack. Tanjong Pagar Centre and The Sail simply because they both feature very futuristic designs. ParkRoyal and Oasia are among my favourites: literally showing the concept of city in a garden.Mixed-use: Marina Bay Financial Towers, Jurong East developments. It might be cliche to put yet another Marina Bay building but its in my list just because the overall planning and look of this complex of offices, residences, and malls is always welcoming to look at and contributes really well as an ""extension"" of the standard Singapore skyline. All the developments at Jurong East right now should really be talked about more - the network of bridges linking all the major malls, the juxtaposition of Westgate Tower compared to the landscape etc. The urban planning behind this area is incredible.Retail: Star Vista, Changi Airport Jewel, ION Orchard. A neat thing about shopping centres in Singapore is that they are all really well-designed and unique, something I don't see overseas. The first thing that Star Vista struck me was...big. Its really fucking big. This megastructure containing a mall, church, and theatre is an underrated building tbh, even with its pleasing geometrical design. Jewel and ION Orchard are among my favourites due to their smooth glass facades.I don't have any least favourite buildings because I believe each building has their own flair, though if you really want me to name an ugly building, it'd probably be Singtel Communcations Tower."
"I honestly disagree with DUO to the fullest extent possible. IMO, Singapore's two best buildings, Parkview Square and The gateway, were ruined by DUO's existence.DUO looks like a lazy compromise between Parkview square's Art Deco style and The gateway's modernist design (Designed by IM Pei). It's hexagonal design looks horrendous besides these two buildings and absolutely obliterates the beautiful contrast between these two buildings.In terms of modernist design, the gateway is pretty underrated, while Parkview Square's interior is absolutely stunning."
"Duos facade hexagons get to me. On different blocks the hexagon proportions change. Some are stretched and others are ok. I thought that was very very distracting, not sure if anyone feels that way or bad geometry affects me this way"
I like Star Vista and it's large atrium. I thought it was clever how the design lets in a lot of natural sunlight and wind so that they don't have to air-condition the entire building. It's a comfortable place to hang out.
"Don't really have a favourite building, but I know I hate NEX.The interior arrangement is a bloody fuck fest.Escalators terminating right behind a pillar, areas with heavy human traffic are narrow, no coherent layout of shop units."
"I heard its this way with new age malls like Compass 1 and Post Centre to make getting around harder, so people would stop and look at stuff. Oh and I hate Nex too, especially the massive led signboard flashing Welcome to Nex over and over again."
I get the convolution of paths for the purpose of delaying exit from the mall or to slow shoppers in front of shop fronts.But shit design like escalators terminating in front of pillars and supremely narrow walkways..that's just fucked up design.All we need is a fire to breakout in that mall for shit design to change. There's a reason why this quote exists: Regulations are written in blood.
"i really like the artscience museum, and i agree that mbs is overrated. also really love the old pastel hdbs, but that’s more for the colours.edit: also really love the condo at ecp when you go from east to central, i think it’s called costa rhu (?)"

Gateway Building the looks like a two edges of a blade."
Love the national gallery. The way it transformed. Amazing how they did so much to it but kept the character . Do you know there are 3 basements below it now that was never there before???
Gateway building is the most uncomfortable building I've ever laid eyes on. Hate it. I wonder what the interior is like because I don't suppose anything useful can be done with the space at the tip of the triangle.
personally i actually quite like the brutalist buildings in singapore - once u take away all the dirt and grime and look at it as itself its quite majestic and unique in a place like singapore
"My favorite building in Singapore would probably be pandan valley, being the first condo in sg there's something about it that I just love. The architect who designed it (Tan Cheng Siong) also designed so many iconic buildings. (my condo was modeled off pandan valley!) it's not the prettiest but it has so much character and history and the community idea in mind is just fantastic.I do also love the pearl bank apartment, metabolism is just such a cool style.The artscience is my favorite unique building and the national gallery has to be in my top 10"
"Parkview Square. When I first moved here in 2017 and saw that building, I thought it was the most beautiful looking building in Singapore. And I still think the same."
Potong pasir iconic hdb
"Fav: The Gateway. The exterior looks interesting from so many angles. And with the right lighting conditions the surface looks like it blends in with the sky making it look somewhat ethereal.Least: Quite a few to pick from, there are plenty of unimaginative buildings around. If I had to pick, I’d say Parkview Square. Its tacky Neo Art Deco-ish design is not reflective of the time period it was built, and feels like a building trying too hard to be cool and edgy. Sticks out like a sore thumb.Hon Mentions: Expo MRT station. Designed by Sir Norman Foster, looks crazy futuristic and alien. Airy, shiny, and so uniquely compared to other above-ground MRT stations of the time. Tiong Bahru SIT flats are pretty amazing in my opinion too, tells a story of what Singapore was like, the direction it was headed towards, and parts of the design were informed by the the local context + latest concrete tech of the time.The Eh! Awards: Masjid Sultan is a weird one. The British seemed to have copypasted the designs from a generic cathedral and popped two onion domes on it and called it a day. It replaced a more traditional wooden structure with a 3-tiered roof that would have been more reflective of the local architecture and its people."
chelsea lodge!!(thought that felt so america movie/dramas)aside from already mentioned above: churches/buildings near city hall. museums etc. all colourful buildings
"Ha one upvote for Chelsea Lodge! It does look like a loft in a borough in Queens, NY or something"
"I really dislike Chevron house, MAS building, and the Singtel buildings near Orchard and in downtown. I'm not a fan of brutalist architecture at all.Favorites would be capita green, oasia, and the Fullerton."
"there is a condominium at around bukit merah/AYE that looks like the apartment buildings are stacked like bricks, and it really deserves some attention instead of MBS"
The Interlace
"The InterlaceThe Interlace is a 1000-unit apartment building complex in Singapore designed by OMA and Ole Scheeren. It is noteworthy for its design which looks like 31 bricks irregularly stacked upon each other, resembling Jenga blocks. It was named World Building of the Year at the 2015 World Architecture Festival. Located on the corner of Depot Road and Alexandra Road, the complex is about 170,000 square meters on 8 hectares of land.[ ^PM | Exclude ^me | Exclude from ^subreddit | FAQ / ^Information | ^Source ] Downvote to remove | v0.28"
ok thankies :)
The red and white hdb blocks at Bishan during golden hour.. There's something so nostalgic about it.
IMHO the Marina One is pretty neat. Though thats more of its interior
HDB blocks paint-work - esp. in the older housing estatesHere's what I'm talking about... https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/10-instagram-worthy-hdb-blocks-in-singapore-10251758
Reflections at Keppel Bay is my favorite hands down
"I really like the Interlace, although my partner hates it because he thinks it looks stupid. So I guess that's easily on his least favourite. I've never actually lived there, so I may be wrong, but when I visited my friends' place there, it was definitely a lot cooler and windier compared to conventional condo designs of towers crammed close to one another.Parkview Square, of course, is another brilliant and gorgeous building. As is the Pinnacle@Duxton - for a long time, I really wanted to move there. I guess these three get mentioned a lot around here.Photos wise, the old police hill station (now mccy) is a gorgeous spot! It's colourful windows are fantastic eye candy, and I never really get sick of looking at it from my office.Something that I haven't seen mentioned here yet is the Park Royal on Pickering. I'm a huge fan of greenery, and I love the effort that was taken to visually complement the next door Hong Lim Park, along with its contoured surfaces that conjure up a very futuristic atmosphere. Green replacement is, to me, an extremely important aspect of architecture that needs to be accommodated for.South Beach Tower looks pretty cool - lots of gorgeous curvature both on its exterior light lines and on the ground floor.I also love the black and white houses dotted all over the country, but especially the Wessex estate, but that could be my bias.I think the Riverwalk is kind of an ugly building. Its really yellow and looks extremely old, like a tower way past its prime. There's also a really poorly restored heritage building somewhere, where it seemed to have been caught between being conserved and being demolished with a glass-y tower built in its place... Can't remember where."
"Favourites: People's Park Complex, both interior and exterior. The outside is imposing and looks like something straight out of a cyberpunk anime. The interior is grand, with a massive atrium.Changi Terminal 3. I think there is no need to elaborate.Least favourites: New Bugis Street. Ugh. Ugh. It is three seperate buildings linked by a maze of linkways, some through a perpetually dark market on the first floor, and others above ground, none of which are in any order. There is piping running all over the facades, some suspended 3 storeys in the air between each building. The windows are placed haphazardly all over the building, and there are doors cut into the front facade above ground as well. The whole exterior is painted in different shades of red. As for the interior, I can't say much since everything is obscured by clutter apart from that there should be more ways to go up and down floors for customers than 2 small staircases at the corners of each floor.Compass One. Compass Point had a great design. Then they painted the whole building white and covered up the huge skylight beside the MRT partially, keyword “partially”, before installing a disgusting staircase beside it. And then they changed the Age of Exploration theme to painfully shiny panels, lighting that is a bit too bright and two glass extensions that obscures the view around the atrium. Oh and they created another mini atrium to make it all more confusing."
"I think an underrated building is the Sail@Marina, and also Pinnacle@Duxton for setting the trends on rooftop gardens."
Beauties: The Emerald Hill stretch of housesThe National Museum of SingaporeThe ColonnadeI tried but I’m not fond of Pearl Bank apartments.
No joke. Esplanade theatre just because I hate duriam
I really like Parkview Square
Favourite:Reflections at keppel bay and Parkview Square.The National Museum

"Since everyone is talking about residential and commercial buildings, I want to say that KTPH is really nice. I like how the eco-friendly design of the building integrates nicely with the Yishun pond and overall making the environment feel much less depressive compared to other hospitals.For older buildings, I like the light blue CDC building along Moulmein.Edit: Sky Habitat is another cool condo. I'd love to have all that balcony space."
"Interlace = mind blown. I think it's the best Singapore has got. Might seem underrated compared to MBS because it's private residential and not open to the public. MBS is really nice just over exposed in the media. Arts Science museum. Tangs (Marriot) is nice too. The Colonnade was my fave up until The Interlace, believe it's wholly owned by 1 family with few it any units sold to the public.Those at the bottom, The Central at Clarke Quay for it's labyrinth, RWS, Star Vista, Ion, helix bridge, Supreme Court of Singapore .Can you even consider malls like Orchard Central, Cineleisure, Nex etc to have any design?Many of the pre-modern era stuff is really nice. Also the Tiong Bahru / selegie art deco flats."
Video on Golden Mile design with 1 of the architects. Now I appreciate the building/design more.https://www.todayonline.com/videos/architect-golden-mile-complex-wanted-be-bold
"I really like the Illuma/Bugis+ building with crystal exterior. I wasn't fond of it much when it first opened. I thought it was too loud/bold for the Bugis area which used to have a quieter vibe, and felt it would have been a better fit in Orchard. But it's really grown of me over the years."
A shame they never clean the exterior of the building
Yeah it's sadly one of the more neglected CapitaMalls.

Happened to have an sgd 1 dollar coin dated 1988 lying in my wallet and was trying to pay for drinks with it: my friend saw me and literally used brute force to stop me from giving away this coin lmao. She said this coin was rare and that I should keep it for a collection but why exactly is it rare? Fellow redditors any opinions? Couldn't find anything googling lmao not sure that its really worth much tbhEdit: OI you guys stop trolling me HAHAHA IK ALR OKAYYYYY AIYOOOO
I’ll buy it from you for $1
I accept only new series 1 dollar coins (desperately need those for the bloody laundry machine at NTU...) HAHAHA
Use the old 50 cent
Use cow play cow moo token
"ah, the weekly $1 hunt"
"The common 1987–91 $1 coin had over 100M minted, so no, you're probably not getting much more than $1 for it.There was a special silver one (only 75,000) minted, but that's probably not the one you have."
OHOH SO DATS WHERE THE SLIVER ONE DOLLAR IS FROM! I used to keep shiny coins as a toddler cause you know toddlers love shiny stuff and was trawling through the collection one day and noticed this sliver 1 dollar coin and was like weird aren't 1 dollar coins supposed to be gold lmao Imma keep that coin and just give my worthless 1988 coin to the drinks stall then HAHA
It's more likely that that silver $1 coin you found was one of these common ones:https://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces6038.html https://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces38482.html
Most probs lol I'll keep it cause its pretty though hehe
"1988 not worth anything. Those from the first series, 1967 to 1984 are worth a little. Like around $1.50 a coin. Some years are worth more."
Ooooh coool!
lan lan suck thumb wait 25 years then sell it to some rich ang moh collector
Lai lai money drop from trees
i have a few of these .https://media.karousell.com/media/photos/products/2018/04/19/coin_1967_singapore_1_coin_1524148756_ee0d7484.jpg
Looks ancient lmao its like the same age as my uncle just realised HAHAHA
And it's huge. I have a few too. https://i.imgur.com/uNdQ5i8r.jpg
"I’ll offer you $1 for it, best price."
"When running the 2.4, I start to 'die' from 800-1000m onwards, but i keep telling myself to continue, but during 3/4 if the run, there is this ache in my calves that makes me die die slow down, sometimes i have to stop. Is there a way to ignore/counter this ache? Also so far ive been failing by 40-50 seconds everytime i run, any advice to be tad faster? I am 16 years old, 1.8m tall but 90-95 kg, so there's my stats if you need them."
"1.8m tall but 90-95 kgThere you go. Assuming that you are not a professional bodybuilder, you definitely have some weight that you can lose. Clean up your diet, eat slightly below maintenance, drop some weight and your run times will definitely improve"
"I'll try my best, thank you!"
"ok another thing is, are your calves the only reason why u have to slow down? do u feel out of breath?"
"My breathing pattern is weird but it helps, i do 2 steps inhale, 1 step exhale, im okay at the start but around 500-600m my breaths will be deep and raspy and loud(my friends told me about this and its kind of a joke now). Will take advice on better breathing patterns and try to implement them though."
"do 2 steps inhale, 1 step exhalethis is actually good. take short sharp inhales on each of of the two steps and take longer to exhale. I'm asking because if you are running too much with bad form you might injure yourself. so if you feel you can't challenge your cardiovascular system through running because your calves give out before you can sustain a certain heart rate for a longer period of time, u can consider other friendlier forms of training like cycling swimming or rowing"
Alright thanks
"take short sharp inhales on each of of the two steps and take longer to exhale.Is there a documented reason/benefit to this?I have always run with a breathing pattern of about 4 steps long inhale, 4 steps to short exhale.Will changing this improve anything? I'm already doing 10 minutes (I'm near 30) and have done this all the way back since my JC days"
"no there isn't, it's just my personal preference. in fact, just do what is comfortable for you but make sure to stick with a pattern and"
You will just need to practice over a period of time. The ache will go away when your muscles are used to the exercise.
"Alright, thank you"
"Try fartlek exercises - instead of running 2.4km for practice, run at your max for 200m, and recovery slow run for another 200m, repeat for 6 rounds.You should start to see your times drop within a month."
"This interval runs really help! I used this method last time when i want to run my first 5km run. It wont be easy, and you will feel exhausted easily. Its best if you have friend that can encourage you. Last time i was lucky enough to have friend who encouraged me when we do night run at pasir ris.Sharing a bit, i first started to run when i weight 85+kg. I ran 5km run in 1 hour (super slow). After 1 yr, i managed to run 10k in 1 hr 10 mins, and i managed my first hm after 3 yrs. Just listen to your body and run with a proper technique.Please do share a pic of your first medal later!!!"
"I'll try that, thanks"
"Not trying to shame you or anything, just an advice I have for you: 90-95 kg is honestly abit too much even though you're 1.8. If you can lose some weight, your body won't have to expend more energy (maybe that's why your calves are hurting cause of all the weight pushing downwards) so aim to lose weight (diet, exercise etc) then I think you'll naturally last longer and run faster"
"I know my weight is an issue, not the first time someone has said this. But thing is, my friends, mainly my family have a tendency to waste food, and they would guilt-trip me into finishing it for them, so i cant exactly help it. Not fast food though, like chicken rice and stuff, basically kopitiam food"
Hahaha I know what you mean sometimes my family would over order then tell the kids to finish don't waste. But now they will order lesser then if still hungry just buy more to topup so maybe this is a good opportunity to also educate your family (friends abit hard) to buy within means and not waste food and money!
"Oh trust me ive tried, sometimes ive tried ordering very little, tried telling them to order less but very little use. Maybe you could give me some tips on how you managed to change your family's mind?"
"For me as the other guy mentioned, I told them before ordering to buy what they can reasonably finish then any extra I won't bother finishing. Sometimes we also buy individual meals (like zichar individual food) so easier to gauge what is a reasonable amount. I guess an easy method is to take your current meals and minus 20% off then see if everyone is still hungry haha but not sure if that works out with your family"
"I just stopped ordering anything for myself and just worked on finishing the food already ordered. Then tell everyone before the meal not to order so much, if they order too much I’m not cleaning"
"Yea i could definitely do this, thanks"
what I did is just refuse once refuse twice. insist they finish up themselves after awhile they will change
Don’t say you can’t help it. Choose to say no. What’s going on with your family trying to get you to stuff yourself?Food intake exceeding the energy you use means you gain weight. Cut down your food intake and exercise more.
"You probably eat just dinner with your family on weekdays? Eat less/lighter/healthier stuff for breakfast/recess/lunch if you can.Like someone mentioned below, if you can run 2.4 on your own twice/thrice a week (just run non-stop, don't look at the timing), you should lighten up in a few months (and probably also improve your timing)."
"If i could lose weight easily I'd love to, but with sec 4 life, my schedule is very tight, and with syf coming up i have even less time"
"From previous comment, start with diet first that's easier to correct short term. Long term, work on consistent exercise don't have to be always gyming hardcore or something. Even simple running for half an hour couple of times a week would help alot."
"Alright, will definitely try this out, thanks!"
"If i could lose weight easily I'd love toThis annoys me. Most of the posts here are telling you to lose weight, cut your food intake and exercise. Meanwhile you are making excuses about how you can't say no to food and don't have the time. You tried to blame your family for pushing food on you. Your mind and your mouth is yours, if you are set on eating less what can they do?You need to cut your food intake. Googled this, ""Aerobic exercise increases your endurance and cardiac health while anaerobic exercise will not only help you burn fat but also help you gain lean muscle mass."" You need to do anaerobic exercise regularly to burn off your fat. Google it if you don't know what is anaerobic exercise.Work your ass off. There is no magic pill."
"They can make a big fuss and destroy the piece at home lolMy brother used to do the very thing you advice. Just don't eat when he doesn't want to. My mum took this very hard and seriously, to the point of ridiculousness. Scold scold sold, vent on us his siblings.But of course as time passed, she got desensitised and she accepted that he eats very little. She stood portions big portions now, just that she won't be angry if he doesn't finish them all.For me, I finish everything everytime, but I think my metabolism is crazy or something, I've maintained my weight for about 7 years now.So please be more sensitive, don't just say ""what can they do"".(though it worked, with some warring in our case) Maybe he had the same parents but he loves them too much to see them angry."
"You are just supporting my point with your example. My point is that if one is set on eating less there's little one's family can do. Sure there's conflict when opposing stances clash, what a surprise. Anyway look at the big picture, I doubt his family are on him all day trying to get him to eat, so if he's set on losing weight while avoiding conflict he can always cut his food intake when he's not with them. Cut from meals he's having when he's not with them. Cut on the snacks. Crank up on exercise intensity if his self-control with food is that bad. OP can find exercises that take little time to burn off fat, I've already pointed him towards anaerobic exercise. OP is responsible for himself.I normally eat a large lunch and dinner daily, initially no breakfast, light or nothing for tea break. After some regular training and exercise I find room for breakfast. I heard muscles are good are at burning off energy at rest so the stories of athletes with enormous appetites make sense. No ba kua. Low on CNY snacks. Just had a few pieces more in a day and I was putting more weight and I had to turn up on exercise to burn it off."
Yeah nothing they can do except to unhinge every other member of the family and all their lives at home miserable
"I can spell my points out for you.Your mind and your mouth is yours, if you are set on eating less what can they do (to stop you from eating less)?My point is that if one is set on eating less there's little one's family can do (to stop you from eating less).I've already said there's going to be conflict when opposing stances clash. I guess from your perspective you prefer your brother to have no backbone and be miserable than to have conflict in the family."
"Hi there, i am 23 & have almost the same physique as you 1.8m/80-85kg and i can honestly say our weight plays alot in our 2.4km run, esp if seldom run.I am also training for my 2.4 for ippt (runnig about 11.15now) and here are what i did/learned to improve on my timing.Stretch ALOT. Like before and after your runs, really focus on the stretch doing both static and on-the-spot jogging to warm your muscles up. i find that if i don’t stretch, i can barely last 1km before the pain kicks in.Try to use more of your thighs when running instead of the calf by doing bigger strides.Breathing. This is something that u have to find your own tempo but after a run if u find yourself nauseous, chances are u are breathing too much. I tend to pace mine at 1breath/2strides increasing as when needed.Never ever look down, always straight ahead. Set yourself a target to run to for eg. the next lamppost. u will motivate yourself better.If you are experiencing pain mid-run, stop and stretch before continuing. I am not sure if this is recommended or not as it might injure you so practice caution.Try speed training instead of the typical ‘just run 2.4’. dash 100/200 and jog for 100/200 and keep repeating it. this is very effective in building up your stamina and lung capacity.These are just some tips i came up myself that might assist you but any running fanatics out there that think what i am doing is dangerous or have better suggestions, do point out as well."
"Alright thank you so much for the advice,I never thought of taking bigger strides but given my height, i should probably take advantage of that."
"Yes, never understimate what our ‘longer’ legs can do when used properly. taking bigger strides can be less tiring as well because short strides tend to put your body weight on your feets at faster intervals"
"When people generally start running, one of the most common mistake is that they run too fast, and generally get winded and struggle to finish and this generally makes running a terrible experience that people hates and gives up on. I will advise that to slow down and try to run at a pace that feels very comfortable at and can sustain easily. The main point is that it must be such an easy experience that you have no problem coming back and doing it again tomorrow. And the day after tomorrow...."
"I know that some people have made this mistake, including me, but through sec 2,3 and now sec 4, i know to not sprint at first. I will try to pace my friend in front and then let him go ahead when i cant catch up anymore and will go with my own pace."
I’m no running expert. But since we are all on reddit why not head down to /r/running and look into the sidebar and faq
"Definitely, it takes a long time to get used to a comfortable running pace over any given distance"
"I don't have much advice for you because I'm certainly no runner and some posters have given good advice about losing some weight and stretching. For me, I failed my 2.4km run many times back in secondary school and they were one of those schools that force everyone to pass unless they had a doctor's letter exempting them from PE and NAPFA. I had to run my 2.4km 7 times until I passed it. I tried to train every morning on the school track before school started and eventually I managed to pass. The times I failed were bad for the self-esteem and I felt really down about it all. It turned out I had a then-undiagnosed chronic pain condition that causes me to be in pain when I exert myself on something as high intensity as running.Here's wishing you the best for your run!"
Thank you!
"There've been a bunch of comments about losing weight and training more, so here are some tweaks to your technique that might actually make a world of difference to you (without requiring you to exercise more):Try and reduce the amount of ""bouncing"" you do when you run. When we jog we tend to not only move forward but also ""bounce"" up and down, and while some of that is unavoidable excessive bouncing is actually a waste of energy (you want to be moving forward, not upwards) - so try to adjust your stride to reduce this.Don't tense your shoulders and arms. When I first started running, someone commented that I looked like I was preparing for a fight - arms kept ""tight"" all the way at chest level (fists close to your chest rather than near the base of your ribs). This actually reduces the amount of oxygen you can take in while running and also takes up valuable energy as you're unconsciously keeping your arms up the whole time. So try to relax your arms and your shoulders with them.Get a haircut. Not sure if this applies to you, but a big part of what kills many runners is just feeling really hot and uncomfortable (in Singapore) - so especially in the weather these days I find it's a lot more bearable to finish a long run when my hair is short, rather than when it's full of sweat and I have to keep brushing my fringe out of my eyes.Look straight, not down.Open your stride a bit more. It's more energy - efficient to take less, longer strides than many short, ""shuffling"" strides (that we sometimes do when we're tired and jogging). Also try and ensure you aren't scuffing the ground with your feet while running, soemthing we tend to do when shag, because this is a waste of energy.Keep a song in your head. Earworms may be annoying but at least they distract you from the ""fuck fuck FUCKKK LA"" that tends to come up around the 1.2km mark. I also find having a song in my head helps me with my breathing, and allows me to zone out until the run is over.That being said, definitely follow some of the other advice here too, and good luck!"
"I am overweight, but can clear 2.4km in about 13mins. For my age it's a pass in IPPT.Here's my advice,Stretch stretch and stretch. Your stretching alone should have you perspiring. I don't mean the garbage ""Warm up"" that your school probably makes you do with the rubbish ankle rotation and what not. I'm talking about 30 second static stretching. Your stretching should last ideally 7 - 10mins. Now, I know this gonna look stupid and weird when your friends are doing the 3min stretches. But trust me, this will save your life now, and later when you enlist (are you a guy?) Look up essential running stretches on YouTube and try to follow those that really work. When you do the stretch actually feel the muscles and wiggle your limb positions until you get maximum feeling. You should try to find the sweet spot where you feel tiny ripples along your muscles.Get enough rest, proper nutrition and a decent intake of water. You're in school so probably you'll be running in the afternoon, honestly this is a bad idea. Try asking if your PE teachers will follow you for a run in the morning before school or something. Running after a whole day of lessons is stupid, and idk if schools still do that. Eat light food on run day, make sure you've cleared your system and drink up throughout the day to hydrate before running.When you're training, (I hope you're running outside of the school runs), instead of running 2.4km in a go, split your runs into 6 x 400m. 400m is one round of the track. Your aim is to run one round in 1min 45secs. Every time you complete a round, take a breather. When you can very very comfortably do 3 rounds without going out of time, step up to 3 x 800m. Just double it up to 3mins 30secs. Rinse and repeat. You may or may not find that this method works, but this how my fat ass passed IPPT in Tekong. It was taught by the certis physical trainers. I was 135kg back then, and I managed pass so, there's no reason you can't !Good luck!"
Thanks!
Cut 10kg and you can easily shave 2 min off your timing.
"You are not the first person to post asking for exercise/IPPT advise. I notice one similarity for all the OPs, especially when it comes to losing weight. When proper advise is given, there is always the same excuse: no time. You probably already know the answers and solutions to your problem, you're just not motivated enough to act on them. Eat less, workout more. A quick home workout is 5 minutes."
"Appreciate it, thanks"
Try to land on your toes instead of your heel (assuming that’s what you’re doing) Landing on your heel causes shin splints and based on personally experience pain in the calves it’s just not advisable running form Hope that helps!You got this man stay strong and I know you’ll achieve the result you want💪
Alright thanks
Just curious but you are stretching beforehand right?
"Yes, mainly legs and neck"
"Well as others have said, you are a little on the heavy side. Not much you can do other than to train. Maybe next time you stretch, put more focus on your calves. Oh also I assume you already do this but didn't mention it, but just in case, when it comes to running you need to stretch everything. Leg, ankles, back you name it, you stretch it."
"According to the BMI, at 1.8m height your weight range should be around 70kg plus minus. If you are 90kg and running, or even walking, that's like carrying a 20kg sack of rice with you. Goes without saying that it is going to be very tiring, and running will be even more tiring."
"Exactly, i know from experience"
"I used to be ~96kgs and struggled to run 1km on the flat on the first few attempts. Starting running is probably the best thing I’ve ever done so hope you keep going with it.Running is really just repetition, which I mean is to keep running as often as you can, and you will see results. Everybody had bad days once in a while. But it’s important to get back running as soon as you can afterward.Running is also one of the most metrics driven sports out there, so it’s easy to track a PB over 1km or your best distance yet. I’d highly recommend signing up for a running tracker on your phone if it’s an option. Logging the progress can be a great motivator. And as you’re getting used to running, the alerts are a good way of getting used to a regular running pace"
Alright thanks
"i would say try the following:an interval strategy of running coupled with a few seconds of walking break. basically 2.4km is not a long distance run so you should not be adopting at a jogging speed. obviously you should not be sprinting either, but try to run faster with a longer stride then take a short 10 seconds or longer walking break before continuing. the short break can help to regain some energy, or recover from fatigue. of course your average speed still has to be higher in order to complete the run faster.do some resistance trainings to build your leg and core muscles, and lose some body fat weight. yes running has more to do with cardiovascular strength, but stronger muscles can carry your weight on the run for a longer time too right. try doing squats, lunges and hanging leg raises with or without weights for 3 sets of 10-12 reps. if you have never tried lifting weights before, this will greatly boost your running performance."
Thanks for the advice
"I'm big too. If you don't have a lot of time you can try tabata. Squats, push ups, jumping Jacks, burpees. Do it daily, and keep track of your count each time. Keep trying to push for 1 more. Even if it's just half a squat more, try for it."
"I'll try that, thanks for the suggestion"
Imo running is mind over body so as long as u don’t give up it will be fine just focus on the next step and the next step and the next step
Firstly would like to commend you for doing the runs in order to keep fit/reduce weight. Not many people bother. Second I'm no expert but I've run middle distance 5km/10km quite regularly before. It sounds to me like you've gotten into this 2.4 thing recently? And probably for some test? So if you're just starting out the worst thing to do would be to start taking timings and discouraging yourself with the lack of improvement. You'd need to be running regularly like at least 3 times a week and if you start to 'die' at 800m just stop running and do brisk walking. Next run go for 1000m.
"Alright thanks, the 2.4 is for my napfa."
"Like what most said, just train consistently. It will get to a point where yours lungs will give out before your legs."
Alright thanks
"Lose some weight. Start by going to the gym and lift some weights and eat less. After your weight is in the normal range, then start running. 90kg is not good for someone your age and height to run well for 2.4km."
"I give you a much proven training regime that i can assure you that your 2.4km can have a better result. Im 34 (coming to 35) and at my age grp i can do a 13.20 mins from 15 min. Which for your age wouldnt be a problem. This is to condition your leg muscles and aneboric state as well as your VO2 max.Do HIIT. High Intesive Interval Training. Do in progress. Start with 20 mins. Jog for 5 mins warm up followed by 1 min walk/slow jog with 30 secs sprint.. sprint i mean really fucking sprint. Do this for 7 times so its 5 mins Warm up 1min/30secs x 7 5 mins cool down. So do it on monday then rest tuesday and then wednesday then rest thursday then on friday you try out your 2.4km and see if you manage to get to shave off a few seconds and i can assure you that you probably will.Then slowly progress your interval to 30 secs run/jog to 30 secs sprint.Then slowly to 1 min run and 1 min sprintAll that including your 5 mins of warm up and cool down for under 30 mins in total.Do your 2.4 km at the end of the week or every fortnight and take note of your progress.If you have the money invest of those watch that can do interval training or download an app that has interval functions that you can strap with you when training.I can guarantee you to have better performance. Your heart will take the beating and your limbs will be conditioned to run better with longer endurance.A few things you need to take note:Sleep well, dont masturbate too much (you need the testosterones for performance, im not fucking kidding you). Stretch alot, use those protective thingy on your legs from the impact of the sprint. Eat carbs a lot of carbs and less fatty shit to have better performance.I did this for 1.5 months before my ippt and my 2.4km was my saving grace from failing. Needed 14 mins to pass but i did it in 13.20 mins (optimal timing for my age category)"
"I only briefly scanned through the comments, saw the amount of flak you're getting about your height and weight.well, bad news, they are sorta right.anyway, I get it. 1.83m ( haha, 3cm taller :D ) and currently at 86 to 89 kg.== food ==I know what you mean by the lunch and dinner thing where your parents pass you food lol.For that, yeah, just try to say no if you can.also, when i was in sec 4, i tend to drink / eat a lot of snacks or sweet drinks.so those are really really bad. try and cut down on those as the calories from there adds up really quickly.== running ==a good advice will be to run more often while focusing more on progressive growth.i remember last year when my yearly ippt was coming and i wasn't ready at all.i started running everyday ( bad idea, explained later ) and soon enough, my timing starts to improve.my officer told me this before and i think that it is really useful to improve on running.""You know your running speed where you cannot talk and cannot breathe properly? Take that to 80% and run with that. You should know your own body lar, if you run at a pace where it is not shag at all then you won't improve that quickly. Keep running at a pace where it is slightly challenging to maintain it.""oh and don't breathe with your mouth. doing that will temporarily make you feel better but it makes your breathing go crazy. think of it as a limit break or a last resort powerup lah. when you are at your final 200m, open up that mouth and go nuts.so what's so bad about running everyday? my feet start to hurt when i run lol. for the next two days, i took a break, did push-ups, sit-ups etc.don't keep going even if it hurts coz you might end up with permanent injuries.== unrelated ==eh, sec 4 ah. lol, if you are struggling with english narrative essays, go search up fictionpress.net and type your ""one word"" essay there. hopefully, the ideas from there can help you with your final exams. I remember what i did was that i memorized three different story ideas, make sure that any possible ""one word"" can be twisted into one of the three ideas and went to clear my Os with it. ez game haha"
Omg thanks
Just run/exercise more. Weight/nutrition plays a huge role too but nothing beats constant practice. I was around 105ish-kg when I enlisted and still got around 10:40-11 when I did ippt. Mentality is also very important!With regards to your ankle pain... Have you reviewed your running posture? Or the way you land on your feet? These little habits affect a lot too.Good luck!
"Warning: Long comment ahead, but read it since it can change your lifeThis is coming from a formerly fat guy, so I'm going to put this bluntly, since that's what helped me lose weight.I think your weight is the problem, along with a lack of stamina. Start by controlling your diet and exercising, but not too intense. This means building up your fitness (i.e 0.8km, 1km). The same happens in weightlifting. That doesn't mean sprinting 100m or going for your 2.4km right away. This gets you burnt out quickly. That said, with your exercise, try to keep it for at least 20 minutes. While swimming is good, you tend to eat more as well, compared to sports like running. Since you're 16, I'm assuming you're probably studying for O levels. That said, you can make 20 minutes in your day. It's really not hard to, just skip those 1-2 videos on youtube. Listening to music also helps a lot when running.Losing weight is just calories in vs calories out. If you have more calories out than calories in, you'll lose weight. Control your diet by considering the amount of calories you should take in. There's an app called myfitnesspal which helps to keep track of your calories. Don't eat calorie dense food like peanut butter. Opt for healthier choices like sweet potatoes compared to rice. Take the skin off your piece of chicken/pork.Losing weight and keeping it off has no quick and easy way to it. The most important thing is to start. Start right now by making a plan, then carry out the plan as soon as possible. Make sure that everyday is a non-zero day. What that means is that you do something everyday. It doesn't matter if you just completed 2 sets of pushups, or only ran 1km. It might not seem like much, but it helps. It's gonna suck, and it won't stop sucking. But embrace the suck, you're not gonna make any progress if you don't want it to suck.tl;dr: Calories in vs calories out, build up your stamina slowly, stick to your regime, and start NOW. If you want it bad enough, to lose weight and live a healthier lifestyle, or really anything in life, you will go after it."
Thanks for the advice!
"Np, feel free to clarify any doubts you may have."
"Useful advise, will try to implement this, thanks"
"Many mentioned weight as the reason for tired calves, but the root reason would be weak backsides forcing the load on your quads, causing your strides to be shorter (more steps, more stress on calves)Do some training for your backside like:sit ups with the ankles held down (we trigger our hams and glutes for this sit up because we are lazy)glute bridges.Stride length is a habit, but stronger hamstrings and glutes make it a bit easier. Also going forward, it's gonna save your knees and lower back as you advance in age.I have the same problem."
Similar to what others are advising you I'm 1.78m but 73kg. I used to be 86kg and lost it over the course of 1 year and therefore my metrics are similar to yours. I can tell you that the weight alone really makes a lot of difference!
"Aside from the already mentioned advice to drop weight, you could also stand to benefit from more leg stretching after every single run, leg strength training about 2-3x a week (doesn't have to be complicated, lunges/squats and calf raises are enough) and more running. The most likely reason you're ""dying"" at 800m-1km is because your endurance is not high enough yet, and your calf pain might also be due to it being unfamiliar with the stresses of running. The 2.4km run may not look like a long distance, but it's being tested at a relatively fast tempo (aka you can't expect to pass it with ""average"" jogging speed), you cannot just jump straight into it.Start off by allocating about 3 days of running per week, of which at least 1 should be easy jogging days, purpose is to build endurance. If you're relatively new to running, use at least one month to do nothing else but these kind of runs first. Run about 3 - 5km (run/walk if you have to, but gradually decrease the walk) on each session, no timing, no nothing, just run at whatever pace is ""easy"" to you. How easy is easy you may ask? Try reciting the pledge or sing national anthem while jogging and if you're having immense trouble getting past even 1-2 lines without panting like a mad dog, you're going too fast.Once you can run an entire 3km - 5km with relative ease without stopping is when you can start mixing in some speed and advanced endurance training. For intervals, if you have a track or somewhere with marking nearby, do 400m repeats (aka, run 400m under 2 minutes 6-8 times or something like that with rest in between). If not, go by time, 1 min run/sprint, 1.5-2 min recovery jog or rest, repeat 6-8 times. Another good training would be tempo runs, use your phone, download a pacer app, go out there and run at your desired pace for 1.6km at the beginning, gradually increasing until you can finish about 3km without stopping (Say you wish to run a 11 minute 2.4km, that is roughly a 7:20 pace, you will train by attempting to maintain that pace for 1.6 first, then maybe increase by 200-400m every week till you hit 3km without stopping after which you can repeat that process with a faster speed), this will also allow you to get a feel for how you should pace during the actual 2.4km test itself, not going at random speeds and sabotaging yourself in the process by going too slow thus wasting time or too fast thus tiring yourself out too early. No more than 2 sessions of these per week and leave a rest day or slow jog day between each sessions like these as they are very strenuous.I trained like this for roughly half a year, and I recently passed the IPPT/NAPFA myself with a sub 12:30 2.4km, not exactly fast but consider the fact that prior to the last 26 years of my life, I couldn't even slow jog 2 full rounds without feeling like I'm about to die from exhaustion. You're a young kid with weight to lose, so I have no doubt that if you keep up with the training/diet, you can even do a sub 10 minute 2.4km. Best of luck!"
"Its definitely less important, but i found a pair of comfortable running shoes will help."
"A strategy you can try is to aim to make your first 3 laps faster than you last 3 laps, so that you have speed reserve to work off of. Many people think the correct way to run is to start slow and slowly speed up towards the end, but this isn't the case. You will always be too tired to increase your speed significantly at the end, and if you somehow do have enough energy to increase your speed by a lot, it means that you ran too slow and no matter how fast you run at the end, you won't be able to make up for it. That doesn't mean you should be running super fast though, but a guideline would be to take your target time and divide it by 6 laps, then aim to be 3 - 5 sec faster per lap for the first 3, then slow down your deceleration as much as possible after that. Bear in mind this isn't a magic bullet though, you won't be able to pull this off if you're too unfit. From my experience you need at least average fitness to execute this strategy. Also, you may or may not feel more shag than usual so be mentally prepared, and you'll need confidence in order to maintain the pace otherwise you'll be afraid of burning out and slow down. All the best!"
"As a national runner with a personal best of 7:40 for 2.4km, I am able to give u advice and a training plan that works best for u. However, u would need to pm me and tell me ALL ur problems u are facing and ur commitment to running before I can help you. No hard work = no result.Also, some of the advices above are bullshit, they might work but not the most effective way. And half the time it sounds easy to pick up their advice like watch ur breathing, foot stride but when it comes to running you would be kinda unsure."

"Run more. Start by being able to run 3km without stopping. Then 3.5 or 4km.when you can complete 4km without stopping, you can be pretty sure you have the basic fitness to complete 2. 4km without stopping. Now you can start to train your speed."

"I think they're barking up the wrong tree.The real food wastage is not in terms of big meals that people can't finish.It's 1) the multitude of buffet spreads being offered across the island (aka excessive consumption); 2) unsold food at bakeries, supermarkets and food outlets, whereby retailers would rather throw uneaten food than give them away to the needy; 3) fresh food that are rejected and thrown away because they are misshapen or don't look 'normal'."
You missed out indented NS food.There are always indented meals with no one to eat them. Where do they go?First we collect them just to sign the collection.Then we drive them to our own camp and dump it straight into the bin.
"PR, initiative for someone to be promoted. Gov have so many internal white elephant projects being made to help in promotions. New director / assistant director / manager incoming after this initiative project. There will awards and recognition too (gov praise gov)"
"Good comment. This is where the issue of food safety versus cost savings comes in. You know ava quite strict so a lot of cargo consignments are rejected after failing lab tests. So you have tonnes of food destroyed at the border.But would people accept these suspect shipments? I highly doubt. USA and Eu have a law where if shipments fail for certain micro parameters like salmonella, the shipments can still be sent to factories for heat processed products just not for direct retail. Would sg consumers accept this? I think not. And it’s not their fault because they bear the costs in terms of risks while industry reaps the savings.Personally I think no reason anyone should eat buffets. Poor quality compared to ala Carte of the same Price , excess calorie consumption and a huge waste of food."
The real food wastage is not in terms of big meals that people can't finishummmmmmmmmmmmmm. This is absolutely also a problem
It certainly is but wouldn’t tackling the other bigger problem be more effective? It’s similar to the plastic straw initiative
Nope. Not comparable. Sold but unconsumed food wastage is significant. It also creates more demand which makes distributors order more which calls for suppliers to ramp up. Anyone working in F&B have known this for years and years
"Overconsumption also leads to diseases of affluence and is waste of both the food and healthcare infrastructure. It's not just buffets that are problematic. Unfortunately it's a free market, and most people would find regulations in this area to be overbearing.There are already organisations working on this since more than 5 years ago. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/app-fixes-volunteer-woes-of-food-from-the-heartNot sure what happened with this initiative, but according to the article, this is just a packaging/pricing issue. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ntuc-fairprice-launches-initiative-to-discourage-food-wastage-at-stores"
"I have never understood the logic of the “value your food because people are starving elsewhere” argument. The food has already been paid for. Even if I don’t finish my food (and you shouldn’t force yourself to finish your food if you are already full), the leftovers are still not going to find their way to people starving halfway across the globe. Likewise, any food that isn’t sold will also be scrapped anyways.It somehow feels like all these measures are for show only."
"This is why when my mum tells me that when I don't finish her cooking, I calmly explain to her that hunger is a logistics issue, not a supply issue. This is incidentally illustrated by how if I don't eat her crappy cooking, no one would transport it to feed kids in Africa! #iamverysmartP.s.: I kid, I love my mum and her cooking. As a tidbit, it's true that hunger is a logistics and not a supply issue though - https://www.wfpusa.org/articles/tedups-why-hunger-logistics-problem/"
"""Wah, can talk back ah, so smart ah? So smart why never get A for maths? Finish your food or I whack you"""
Consider your explanation hijacked for personal use. 😎
that argument is supposed to mean “kids elsewhere have no food to eat so you better be appreciative that you do” but i understand where you’re coming from. it’s a really dumb logic once you think about it in depth
It goes against psychology. If we really should just appreciate what we have then fuck it we just live in kampong and eat people's leftovers don't need to work for a better life.
"Good initiative. Singaporeans throw food away because (mostly) we can afford it. And the weather doesn’t help. Our food turn bad quickly. And people rather get their money’s worth than pay the same price as everybody and get ‘less’. But I think the ‘encouragement’ style won’t really work. Singaporeans are ‘encouraged’ a lot of things by the government, but until they are pinched where it matters (like their pockets) I don’t see how this will improve the situation much."

"NEA launches year-long battle against food wastageSINGAPORE - With food waste among the five largest sources of waste in Singapore, the National Environment Agency (NEA) hopes to get people to adopt three habits when eating out so as to combat wastage.The year-long drive, part of the Year Towards Zero Waste campaign, was launched by Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor at Yishun Park Hawker Centre on Saturday (Feb 16).It encourages people to order only what they can finish; ask for less rice or noodles if they are unable to eat that much; and say ""no"" to side dishes they will not consume.NEA will be reaching out to people at 25 hawker centres and at partner organisations such as Sheng Siong Supermarket and Prime Supermarket.It will also spread the message at schools and institutions of higher learning. Last year, more than 150 schools organised food waste reduction activities.Dr Khor said that outreach efforts will be conducted at hawker centres, which are one of the most popular eating spots for Singaporeans.""Actually there are also benefits in terms of eating more healthily, because you don't overeat. Usually if you don't want to waste, then you just eat everything up. Also, it is good for the pocket, because you can save money if you don't over-order,"" she said.Related Story PUB, NEA find a way to convert sludge and food waste into energyRelated Story Reducing food waste with a digester that can process one tonne of leftovers in 24 hoursRelated Story How supermarkets fight food waste in SingaporeRelated Story Eco special: How to minimise food wasteApart from such efforts on the ground, there will also be publicity on digital platforms, with a Web series featuring public figures incorporating food waste reduction practices into their daily lives, to inspire viewers to do the same.""Singaporeans love their food, yet food waste is the second-largest waste stream to be disposed of. There is clearly more we can and should do together,"" said NEA chief executive officer Tan Meng Dui.""We would like to create a pervasive culture where everyone will have an instinct to 'buy, order and cook just enough', encourage their friends and family to do the same, and even influence the practices and behaviours at their workplaces towards reducing food waste.""In Singapore, food waste has risen 40 per cent over the past 10 years, from 568,000 tonnes disposed of by households and the food industry in 2008 to around 809,800 tonnes in 2017.This made up 23 per cent of total waste disposed of in Singapore in 2017, with only 16 per cent recycled.Nee Soon GRC MP Lee Bee Wah, who is chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for the Environment and Water Resources, called the anti-food waste campaign ""timely"".""I remember when I was young, my mum used to tell us 'Don't waste food, there are still people in this world who do not have food'. And this advice is still valid,"" said Ms Lee.She added that with the creeping effects of climate change, more Singaporeans have ambitions about saving the Earth, and this latest campaign also works towards that.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

Both genetic and the socioeconomic environment they are born in.
"tldr; students from elite school likely tend to come from elite family. Being from an elite family comes with tons of advantages.Ok time to put on my sociology hat. Many students from elite schools also come from well to do families. Their family probably has a few (or ALOT) successful members who can serve as both a positive role model and a guide to school. Elite families also tend to know other similar ones, so those kids were likely to grow up with other kids with similar backgrounds, values and beliefs. This is basically ""social capital"" at work. They have successful people in their life (positive role model), to be successful in school is considered normal (norm to be ambitious and driven) and they have friends going through the same thing with people who can also guide them (social support).Well-off families also have more ""cultural capital"". Those families tend to be more interested in intellectual pursuits like playing classical music, reading literature, going on holidays to experience different culture etc, which are are values, knowledge and attitudes that translate well to the curriculum in school.Lastly, let's not ignore the simple fact that money simply makes things easier. Parents can send their kids to the best tutors, they don't have to work at mcdonalds to earn pocket money, they have great facilities to study at home (no such thing as studying in a noisy room with sibling running around) and so on.Not saying that only elite families have access to money, social and cultural capital, but they are likely to possess more of those than to average and lower income families. I am also not saying that if you're poor, you can never succeed. Tho if you are poor, you have ALOT more things to overcome on your own."
"As a former soci tutor, I am gratified someone wrote this. :)"
Ahh I see. Thank You!!
shit just happens
"Same reason some people are stronger than others, some are faster than others etc.Those in ""good schools"" aren't always smarter too - they might just work hard or have connections."

Genetic and Grit
"As for me, I was from poly but i studied hard enough to enter a local university. My GPA climbed from 3.3 (first sem) to a final gpa of 3.82. So what happened?back in sem one i was one of the paikia or yp, whatever you called it. I met this fellow smoker friend of mine who was incredibly good at studying. Just from meeting this friend, i decided to study really hard, remove toxic yp friends from my lives. Throughout the course of my studies, i have won multiple course awards. So what was the trick to success here? There would be the people you meet in your lives and the environment you are presented in. I think genetics do play a part here but i think the former 2 are still more important."
"What about your social life though? Since u did well, studying really hard must be one of the key pointers here.Would really like to hear from you."
"Used to be those who goes all out to make friends with everyone, try to gain followers on instagram but I realised that that was super pathetic. Nowadays i just got myself some close friends (simple, laidback people) and we just chill at each other place. No drama, no disrespect, we just chat and mellow out. I think that was because i am a laidback person in general. Speaking of being a laidback person, i totally couldnt live i Singapore as there are way too many people and people who always freak the fk out over the simplest thing. This is why i decided to move to New Zealand right after my Uni!"
"Honestly if you couldnt understand the culture or fit into it well, probably the environment and circumstances you grew up hasnt prepared you for it and that is ok. It is thus your job to find out what is suitable for yourself and ignore what others think!"
"I heard they all practice the dark arts of lucid dreaming. That means that they can study 24 hours a day, 7 days a week while ordinary humans have to sacrifice a third of their lives to sleep. Hard work multiplied by more hours spent studying = better smarts lor"

HAHAHA okay...
"luck and genetics.. there's not much to it really. if you look at things like sports on an international level they are also largely dominated by a certain group.i mean, the people involved want you to believe that they deserve every bit of success they have but let's face it... there's a lot of luck at play."
i see i see. TY!!
"There are a variety of factors, but one that I feel matter significantly but is quite underrated is genetics.I’ll like to share an anecdote about my sister and I. Both of us come from the same middle-class family, and our parents treat us similarly. Growing up, I was the one who was perceived as ‘smarter’; I did very well in PSLE and got into a ‘good’ secondary school, then screwed up during that period (because of depression) and was mostly rank last in class. But I recovered during my last six months and managed cut my rank points by 30 for actual ‘O’ Levels, and got into a ‘neighborhood’ JC, where I proceeded to slack my way through for the most part but scored very well for ‘A’ Levels to the surprise of everyone. I got into a local university and managed to score a job within the first four months of graduation. That’s my story.My sister on the other hand, is generally less quick witted and take longer to grasp concepts, but what she has is incredible drive and persistence. She did badly for PSLE, got into a ‘neighborhood’ secondary school, but ranked amongst the first few, got into poly, and consistently is the first in class.I’m bringing genetics into this because looking back, I realize we totally are like our mom and dad. My mom is slow but hardworking (like my sister), but dad is smart but can be incredibly lazy day-to-day (like me). I’m also like my dad in the sense that I tend to obsessively chase things I’m interested in (books!) and self-learn a lot of things, whereas both my sister and mom are more down to earth and have little passions aside from what is presented to them in school and environment. Both my parents ‘converged’ to around the same income status in the end, and I believe my sister and I will too. Honestly, being ‘smart’ doesn’t matter as much as people think, what matters a lot too is pure hard work."
"IQ, hard work and discipline."
lucky dice rolls
"This is a very complicated question you asked. I'm looking at the comment section and it seems like people are answering it in a surface level. To start of, elite schools might have people who are smarter or maybe there are people who can just study well. There might be people who are of average intelligence but their personality makes them use their brain more than the average people. That can be ""smart"" in a way. Bringing up school as a metric to gauge whether people are smarter than others is just naive. So many things are involved together than just someone who is smarter than someone else = elite school. Someone who's priority is to get into university and be a top scorer shouldn't be immediately called smart just because that person really did get full score for all his test. There are many ways to look at intelligence and I'm not sure how you are defining it OP."
ah I see. I get your point. Thank you!!
"Character A: Born in an upper class household stay in landed property/condo, parents both working high pay jobs, go to tuition and music lessons after lessons at elite school, get scholarship go US/UK to study.Character B: Live in HDB. Has 4 siblings. Have to take care of siblings and help at parents' workplace. Cramped living environment. Become saikang warrior during NS because lower education level ppl get low clearance shit vocations.Which will you pick?Oh sorry. I forgot Singapore is a meritocratic fair society and every school is a good school."
Here is a comic that describes this: https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/the-wireless/373065/the-pencilsword-on-a-plate
"Limitless opportunities. Public schools have student who can barely afford lunch / essentials. Want to learn new sports / art / tech ? Sorry parents can’t pay for it. There are primary school kids who can already do basic coding , it’s due to opportunity as their parents can sent them for programs and buy the equipments needed.They are just like others, struggling in some subjects, but can afford better tuition / personalized attention to their needs. There are school trips and global exposure, those in public school even with subsidy/ grant may not afford to cover expenses.Elite schools even prepare their students for international competition (such opportunities are rare in public school). The ones from elite also have the cushion of going overseas to study if they don’t do well (some even study law / medicine). Being average in public school means , your choices are ite / poly-> work. Those from elite schools can pay to get in overseas uni and grad, come back and be your boss despite lower score o / a level / IB score.Also, teaching staff. Good IB school have support to direct them to score well (guide them to success). Public school are crowded and understaffed. Some of the teachers don’t really care and constantly make mistakes. Their staff are also very experienced and have better credential (some even PhD) than the ones in public school. Obviously not all teachers will be great, and students themselves need to be self motivated. But the resource available / environment are important factors.Peers also make a difference. One school you will have classmate who is the son of a president. The other school, your friends are mostly from average family of grab driver / office workers. The gap in networking is real and make a difference later on in life, that’s why school name (brand) is important - alumni.You being top 1% in public school gets you a gift card / bursary money award. Top 1% elite school, prep you with more challenges to develop you further."
"I would say it is a combination of school reputation as well as the resources they have( teacher quality, teaching resources, teaching schedules etc).More smart? Maybe not so, but you will have a higher chance of producing a good student if the environment is very conducive.Branding is a powerful tool and more often than not “increases” the “worth” of the person. Take for example you feel more atas when you hold a gucci bag vs another bag with same quality without brand."
Branding is a powerful toolProbably why iPhones are still popular in 2019
"ah i see. so those good schs like hci, RI just happen to have extremely good teachers? :/ thats quite disheartening to hear if its tru tho :("
I have a friend who was studying in RI from secobdary to A level. He said that that teachers there are not really passionate in teaching and sucks. But it is the students who put in the effort and self study.
"no it's not true. in my 6 years at an 'elite school', I have been fortunate to be taught by only one 'extremely good' teacher."
"These are just intrinsic features of our world that some individuals will have better intellect while others do not.In my opinion, most movements of equality don’t make sense. Why? Because the facts of reality are that individuals are not equal, no campaign is ever going to change that, well, maybe except genetic ubiquity.The more relevant question might be why there is a need for such equality movements in the first place. It seems to me that the fundamental reason is probably not to leave individuals behind that feel undervalued both in tangible (financial, prospects, material wealth) and intangible (purpose, meaning, living satisfaction) aspects. Ultimately equality can only be reached if people adopt some sort of perspective that sees & respects individuals for their individual strengths and for the importance of the role in society. This is important; we all live lives of very contrived meaning, if at least hedonist aspects are satisfied then perhaps we can complain a little less."

"A child that is born to doctor parents would have been influenced by their parents in the manner of speech, thought and how they use their brains.My experience with those highly educated parents and how they approach their kids is worlds apart from the parents of lower SES."
"Anyone that tells you its purely nature or purely nurture is bs'ing you. In reality, it's always a mix of both."
Maybe its because they take in the best students from the PSLE?And there is more exchange of ideas?
"Nature or Nurture, the age old question.I believe it's both. Some people are born genetically smart, where they mentally mature way earlier than their peers. In the most extreme cases, it result in them needing special attention and a different way of teaching as they are socially unable to bond with their peers and feel the lessons aren't challenging. There was a recent case in the news, about a year ago, where a family uprooted themselves for their child to study at a school in Australia catered for children like him.Then you have the nurture part, as seen in the above example, this option of uprooting is only possible if the family have the ability to, funds and mobility etc...Which are socio-economical factors. Children born in wealthier and well-educated families tend to have access to better opportunities, support circle(friends, mentors, teachers, family) and connections. They are better able to inculcate good qualities and are more well-read in general, the effects will just snowball from there.On the other hand, children of families of lower socio-economical backgrounds tend to be hardier and have more ""thirst"". This allows them to break through any obstacles and progress up the education system effectively. If and once they succeed, they will join the ranks of the above and their children will have an easier time."
"Psst here's the secret.Working/ being pushed by parents really hard when you're young. I'm talking like P3 age kids. Think about it, the content in primary school is a fricking breeze compared to O levels and secondary school. It's far easier to succeed if you push yourself then as compared to slogging it out later on. If you get in GEP, you'll have an easier entry into sec school. If you missed the GEP train, last chance is PSLE. If you score enough for IP, you're basically set for the next 6 years. If you're studying for O lvls, it's already too late. For IP you only have to barely pass Y4 finals to promote to JC whereas the cut off point is suuper low for those coming in through O lvls.Of course, you gotta be at least somewhat above average in terms of ""talent"""
"Only one thing - genetics.Not money, not grit - genetics.When we look at the rich, or elites - most of them have parents who are smart and from their smarts, they make their riches.These smarties marry other smarties - usually - lawyers marry lawyers (but have affairs with stewardesses), doctors marry doctors etc etc - their kids, by virtue of genetics, are born smart - you can deny it all you want, but some people just ""get"" maths, science, language easier than others .It's not about money, one of my best friends is also my richest friend, his dad owns a concrete and construction company - they live in a detached house in Serangoon - but his dad is in construction because his brains couldn't take him anywhere further - and similarly, for my friend, he struggled all his school life - his dad sent him to the most expensive tuition centres - 6 years in the Learning Lab! ($2000 per subject per semester!)LKY was right about the whole eugenics thing - smart people breed smart people."
smart people breed smart people.Then the world is f*cked because smart people usually breed less.
"Yep - this is what we are seeing across all the industrialised countries - even in the US, the smarter areas have significantly less reproduction rates than the dumber/poorer areas."
"Sadly this is not true even though many people would Iike to believe it is the case.I was in the GEP and myself and many of my peers (from middle/lower income groups) breezed through the education system up to and including the university level with no/minimal tuition. I have a friend who started studying seriously 6 weeks before A levels getting an A for GP and 2 As 2 Bs for his subjects.Genetics plays a massive role and environment is important but not super critical. Of course money helps to boost performance, it always does. But baseline academic aptitude differs a lot between people."

Sorry but what the flying fuck. The same online publication that is ranting about bicentennial is the people who helped advertise the shitty raffles exhibition.https://sg.asia-city.com/arts-things-to-do/news/revisiting-raffles-exhibition-reveals-what-ignoramus-raffles-really-wasCorrection same writer
bicentennial feels way less hyped than sg50 tho
"Bicentennial honestly feels shoehorned to earn some tourism dollars, political points, and attempt to raise patriotism.SG50 felt somewhat organic in comparison."
Have we forgotten #simisaialsosg50
"Which is why I said somewhatI think SG50 is something to be more proud of since it was something we had a hand in, while Bicentennial is just a random celebration which no modern Singaporean had a part in and is more disconnected to."
Sg50 was something really worth celebrating - 50 years of independence as a nation.Bicentennial feels like someone liked Sg50 and wanted to find another excuse to get Singaporeans to celebrate and raise national pride again. Plus election coming up so need to get that patriotic spirit up also.
Meanwhile the great irony is the the Bicentennial shows that the foundations of Singapore go beyond the PAP. Shows that key institutions and government structures were put in place by the colonial government and it wasn't really a PAP miracle to have us progress to this extent.
"That's one of the things that bug me.SG50: ""it took us 50 years to go from nothing to where we are now""Bicentennial: ""jk we were already thriving for 200 years""Really shows you how facts can be twisted to suit your story."
"Tbf, the SG50 narrative was not based on facts but ignorance. Of which many on this sub was accomplices of."
And profited from greatly.
Simi bicentennial.... Does it really affect our lives?
If he becomes our Prime Minister then he will be our first Prime Minister standing at 155cm
https://xkcd.com/1122/Reminds me of this XKCD comic!
Excellent. About time that people realize that height only matters if your job is to chop wood.Benito Juarez (the Mexican equivalent of Honest Abe) stood at 1.37. Still managed to stop the French from turning it into a European colony.
Calm down nobody is seriously here.

"I’ve recently applied for BA Fine Arts at Lasalle. Just curious about the student culture there. Do you have to be incredibly skilled to attain good results? Also, is it hard to get in?"
"There is a certain askance in terms of technical fundamentals (e.g. brushwork, craft, research skills...) especially in FA. Student culture is quite dynamic and fun.As far as I understand, there is a certain amount of competition for placement. But if you have a strong portfolio and have an idea what you would like to learn and accomplish, you would do well.One thing I would like to bring up is that you need to manage your time well. I cannot stress the importance of time management enough. The crunchtime will always be stressful and you might face a lack of resources (e.g. computer labs, materials and equipment) during this period (a lot of students will be using the same resources as you would).Read up on your assignments early, think of what topic interests you as part of the assignments, and engage your lecturers or seniors early for assignments (they might be able to provide ideas and even source literature to read up on).Don't be afraid to engage with students from other disciplines. The college encourages cross-disciplinary interactions as it is possible to germinate creative ideas and help to improve your learning opportunities.If you have a budget, eating at Sim Lim Square foodcourt (or the 2nd floor eateries) is pretty decent."
thank you!!! this is really helpful :)
What type of fine arts are you interested in?
mainly painting and pencil drawing :)
Good. However do be mindful that a pure fine arts degree or diploma might be difficult to make a living in pragmatic Singapore. I would opt for concept art and illustration for a balance between fine arts and practicality.
"Just my two-cents stemming from the competency gaps that I have encountered in this industry.If you are exceptionally good at painting, you might want to think about painting conservation as a potential career. While it is a super niche career with limited self-expression, there is a certain amount of science to it as well as the satisfaction of working with old paintings that are supposed to go up in our museums.LaSalle doesn't provide specialised modules on this, but it is a field of specialisation that you might want to look into.You can check out The Conservation Studio and what they do. Likewise, you can look into our Heritage Conservation Centre for some inspiration."

"It’s the burning of petrochemicals in Pasir Gudang, Johor Bahru. The aforementioned place is located north-east of Singapore, and is a huge place (311sq km) dedicated to heavy industries.BRIGHT ORANGE GLOW / BURNING SMELLHuge flares can last for a week as it takes production levels to reach full capacity when starting up.A spokesman from one of the petrochemical companies in Pasir Gudang stated : “There are about 10 petroleum chemical plants in Pasir Gudang, so Singaporeans can expect to see instances of large flares perhaps 5 to 10 times a year”Given the number of petrochemical plants working at the same time, it is why the smell it is accumulating and giving off is really bad.It can even cause rumbling.KNOWN SIDE EFFECTSReported side effects of prolonged exposure include : Headaches, eye irritation, itchy throat and other respiratory conditions . It is also reported to have induced asthma attacks, so be careful.WHAT HAS BEEN DONE SO FAR TO SOLVE THISIn September 2017, NEA assured that it’s air monitoring systems detected only “low and safe levels of volatile organic compounds and sulfur dioxide”However, no figures were given and no safety guidelines were elaborated.CONCLUSION / THOUGHTSAlthough there was reassurance that the situation “isn’t too bad”, please take care and stay hydrated.Leave your thoughts below.EDITIt seems that the smoke, carried by the wind, can even travel all the way to places like Ang Mo Kio and even ClementiSources :https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/fire-in-punggol-no-its-in-jbhttps://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/www.99.co/blog/singapore/hdb-punggol-pasir-gudang/amp/"
Oh well so much for promoting living up in the north in a “kampung” environment recently.
north is ok esp woodlands/sembawang side as it's near JB... just the poor dudes living at Punggol North Shore :(
The residents of the affected areas should petition your MPs to call for an investigation and publish the types of chemicals and carcinogens which are released in the air.If only MPs and their families actually live in their constituencies...
Such is life
"The people living in Jurong East, West, and Boon Lay has been ""dealing with it"" for decades. They should do the investigation in the west of SG as well."
I swear it has happrened more than 5-10 times a year. More like 5-10times a week.
yah lorhcant help but wonder if cough cough cough is doing some things ah cough cough

"Every 3 months someone posts ""What is that bright orange light far away? Should I be worried / Are we being invaded?"" and I always think that that person just moved house because it's impossible to miss it after living there for at least half a year.However, it's only a single plant that does the flaring at night. It always comes from the same place, if you go to Seletar Dam you will be able to see it much more clearly.The new thing this time was the loud rumbling noise. We haven't had that before."
I think it depends on the magnitude of flaring. At times the rumbling can be heard at yishun dam area.

"Water front living leh, the goldcoast of Singapore.. Read it as advertisement by hdb.. Lol"
"Can anyone living in Punggol now share their experiences? Also Punggol is quite large, the level of exposure should vary... where is the worst hit?"
"some article 2 points A 2015 Detailed Environmental Impact Assessment by Lotte Chemical Titan, which operates one of the largest petrochemical facilities in Pasir Gudang, found that the measured values of some VOCs within the plant’s premises exceeded “odour threshold values”, owing to the large number of similar oleochemical plants in the area.During the inter-monsoon months and the Northeast Monsoon (October through to May every year), prevailing winds from the north means that Punggol residents are directly subject to the odour of the higher-than-threshold VOCs from Pasir Gudang,No figures were given, nor were the safety guidelines elaborated upon.The concern about Pasir Gudang, beyond physical irritations, is the potential for the VOCs to cause long-term damage to the health of residents of Punggol (who are literally on the front-line should an accident or major incident happen in Pasir Gudang)(and yes an accident happened once during 2017)Typically, when a petrochemical facility experiences a power failure and has to start up again, large amounts of VOCs are released into the air. We can only hope that Pasir Gudang’s power grid is as good as ours, although power outages there have indeed happened a few times over the past years (many of which aren’t reported and remain unknown to the authorities).combination of factors that count against us: wind from the North; wind speeds dipping at night; heat rising from buildings in Punggol, all of which increases the radius of airborne benzene dispersion. The researchers concluded that higher levels of residential petrochemical exposure appeared to elevate the risk of developing leukaemia among individuals between the ages of 20 and 29 years, but did not appear to affect risk among children. In another Taiwanese study published in March 2018, researchers found that “elderly and female residents living within 10 km of a petrochemical complex had higher carcinogenic exposure and cancers than those living farther away from the complex after the complex had been operating for 10 years”. The study also highlighted other potentially carcinogenic pollutants other than benzene, such as heavy metals. one thing’s for sure: Singapore’s universities and research bodies certainly don’t lack any expertise. Studies that have been done in other countries and cities, the ones highlighted in this article, can and should be done in Singapore to ascertain our situation and risks.Even if the possibility of something bad happening to a resident is as low as winning 4D 1st prize (or as high, depending on how you see it) or as likely as being struck by lightning, Singaporeans still deserve to know."
"It is bad!Reading from some refinery site, it said that flaring occur for safety to release pressure and for a short duration, but this happen frequently for a long duration"
It was pretty bad last night. I had to close my windows on a cool and windy evening :/
"Idk if anyone watched the Paranormal Activity movies but everytime the demon appears, there will be this low rumbling noise very similar to the noise that happens here. Legit felt scared until i went to search what was happening lmao"

Aerospace. Good luck!
"Not sure bah, as a fellow mechie. Here to just provide a bit of perspective, I’d say it’s because it’s Singapore, and because we both work under SMEs.For SMEs, they aren’t really prepared to have engineers around, which is why you’d Bao everything - meaning, while you learn a lot of everything, you specialise at nothing. It’s actually something your future hr can use against you.I’m heading towards ST (not exactly a MNC, but a large SME), and looks like there are actually structures for career progression. For ST, I see that we end up as principle Engineers, and move on to managerial roles from there.I see that design Engineers run consultancy firms as well, which are pretty project-based, and volatile. If you’re good, you rake in a lot (around hundreds of thousands to millions per project) from projects you handle. If you’re not, you don’t earn anything.For MNCs, I’d like to think that there’s director-level positions available, though principle Engineers should be one of the last few stops bah.Try Dyson. I heard they’re hiring design engineers, probably for their ev project.Alternatively, try for other types of engineers, such as purchasers, manufacturing engineers, and qc Engineers. They’re all mechies, or at least the ones I’ve met, so there’s that alternate pathway bah."

"Hi. I’m just a random teenager and about to take my O-levels this year. I need some help. My father has been hospitalised and got his leg very recently amputated. I don’t know how to approach him. I don’t know how to approach my grandfather. (I assume he is kept in the dark, knowing my mother) My mother told me we would have a bit of financial difficulty seeing she would be the sole breadwinner of the house. She also said my father might have depression. I don’t know how to react or feel. I feel hopeless and lost. I’ve seen a counsellor and feel a bit more certain about my future. But I’m getting a feel of mixed emotions and worry. For my future. For my family.Do any of you guys know any financial aid we can look into? Or any advice to deal with this. My family is not really well-off but we can still live comfortably. Only have house loans and medical bills to pay. If you read this far, thank you for reading my vent.Edit: Thank you to everyone for the overwhelming support and advice. I’ll talk and discuss with my mother and teachers on how to help my family cope. And thanks for the suggestions as well as providing options for what to do and how to move forward! Again, thank you for your guys’ help!"
"Hi. I'll suggest things for you, please try them out.Seek family service centre (FSC). There should be one nearby. There should be social workers who specialize in helping less fortunate families like you. They know a lot on the schemes available that your family could or could not try for. This is my best suggestion. Edit: I think their main targets are low income families. Personally, I think no harm to head down if you still think family income is too high but not low enough.Contact form teacher privately. You could omit any information that you seem too sensitive but I think it is alright. They could help facilitate financial assistance schemes for you in school, be it straits times pocket money funds or what not. Or at least they could refer you to another staff who deals with student assistance schemes. Do it together with suggestion 1.Suggest you to share the burden of keeping the house clean with your family. Your mother will be extremely exhausted over time.Hope these will be helpful. Let us know how else we could help you as a subreddit. Stay strong. I'll add more later.Edit:4. More of an advice. My personal experience: Things seem unreal for a while. Let things settle down and try to be more proactive at home. It really helps everyone emotionally. Also, I do not know your closeness with parents/family. At times of difficulty, being close and bonded to deal with the coming hardship makes things a little better for everyone. I worry not just for you, but for both your parents too. They (especially your mother who has to take over the role of earning the majority) will definitely appreciate it and feel loved in return for their struggles. If you aren't that close, at least try to do your part as a child of your parents. I hope that's not the case.5. At your free time, try reading up a little on how to live with an amputee family member. (I simply googled and picked the first article: https://www.limbs4life.org.au/news-events/news/practical-coping-strategies-to-help-amputees-and-their-families)The emphasis for suggestion 5 is really on your father while number 4 is more towards your mother. I don't have the experience you need, but I know there are many articles online which could give you some insights on how amputees feel at home and for you to better react and adapt. So that they feel much better at home."
Thank you so very much!
"To add on, FSCs usually have counselling and family work (if needed). Financially wise, they may refer you to an SSO - I'm not super sure what each FSC's SOP is. They probably will know more on schemes that are available for you, since it sounds like you might need more short-term financial aid to help with bills.Also, not sure if you could but perhaps a Medical Social Worker could help also. Since there are several aspects to work on, like for discharge planning and etc. I'm not really sure what MSWs do, so can't really comment on that.Not sure for what it is worth, but drop me a PM if ya need someone to talk to. Hope I can help?"
"To add on, FSCs usually have counselling and family work (if needed)./u/Carines tagging you here so you can see my response.I have been to an FSC before and the social workers there are very helpful. They will help you find some other agency to help you out financially, and also if you want your family can undergo counselling (they may also refer you to some other agency for counselling)More about FSCs, from MSF's websiteGo here, enter your postal code and find your assigned FSC. Then I guess just call them. I'm not so sure about the process about getting help since I myself was referred there by CPS so I just walked in and told them that and they just referred me a social worker on duty."
Look for help ASAP! Hope you get through this. Make sure to take care of your own well being too.
Definitely. Thank you!
"Very useful comment, thank you for writing this. Clicked on this thread to see if OP got the help he needed, glad there are so many people helping him."
"above comment is the best advice. please remember your parents emotional health is not for you to shoulder and heal - that’s not your responsibility but a professional so don’t take it upon yourself. take care of yourself first and foremost if not you won’t be able to help your family. make sure you are monitoring your own mental state through this tough period, stay in touch with your counsellor. self care when need be. plan your time and set boundaries with yourself and family because it will take you more time to study and focus for O levels due to the stress and trauma. grades aren’t everything, but if your financial future is affected then it will play a bigger part (if you require scholarship in future or if your potential profession requires academic qualifications for example). your parents should be supportive of all that (if not, forgive them and yourself you are all in a tough spot. have space and time apart first then sort it out later). your family will need to lean on external help to get through this - I hope that you and your parents will recognise that and make use of resources. take care please, your situation is tough indeed and our hearts go out to you all. your situation is also not impossible if you follow a plan and some guidelines and share and communicate with your family. just remember you are not required to sacrifice your wellbeing and future for this. good luck and comment back in here if you need anything else.edit: an idea would be to have an open notebook in your house where u can all write notes to each other. that may circumvent the usual asian culture where affection is quite rare. you can lead by example by writing vulnerably but coming from a place of love. only if you feel your parents are able to follow that healthily (i.e. they aren’t emotionally abusive)"
"straits times pocket money fundsHonestly, FAS would be a better option for now. SPMF is nice, but at the secondary level it has fewer benefeciaries, has stricter entry criteria, and about the same monetary benefit ($95 a month under SPMF vs $100 a month under FAS). Plus you get $120 transport credit per annum for public transport.SPMF would only be better when you reach-post secondary, however please do complete your tertiary education within 4 years since that's as long as they'll subsidize you for, so if you mess up Os and go ITE your final year of poly you'll be financially on your own. At post-secondary you get $120 a month from SPMF whereas FAS just gives you a $900 bursary. However keep in mind SPMF has stricter criteria than FAS.EDIT:https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/financial-assistance/moe-financial-assistance-scheme-(fas)https://www.spmf.org.sg/post-secondary-studentsLinks to read up and decide yourself."
"Tell the doctor or nurse. They will refer you to a medical social worker. They will settle everything for you, including household expenses if you are eligible for it."
"One of my worry is that our household will not be eligible for financial aid, my mother’s income is above the required income of >$2500~ for the household. So financially we’ll be in a bit of a tight spot"
See them and see what they can do. Some things are calculated by per capita.
Alright. I will. Thank you so much!

"rmb your parents also got their own problems now. a huge change in all your lives. so try to make each other happier. like try doing more household chores so your mom got time to rest after work. gotta try different approaches and see how to interact with your dad. it depends on how he reacts to his new situation.also rmb cos its o level year to focus on your studies first. not sure how much you can help with your family issues. try to reduce expenses rather than get part time job.without knowing your income. hard to advise which financial help you can get. you can ask your teacher. or go straight to principal office and ask the admin lady who sits at counter for financial aid application forms.try googling for financial aid info. govt help usually aimed at very low income. if cannot qualify. look at religious, clan organisations or other charities that you can qualify for aid from.ask hdb to reduce monthly house payments citing the lower income of your family. if they reject try asking through your MP. election gonna be soon. hdb will be more willing to allow you to make lesser payments.hospitals should have social workers who can help with your dad adjusting to his new situation. they also provide info on financial aid. look at the hospital website for social worker contact."
"I will, thank you!"
"Many here have directed you to financial resources so I won't talk about that. I think helping your father adjust to a new equilibrium is just as important for you and your family (especially seeing that you're taking O levels this year). I suggest that you inform the hospital or your social worker that your father may need some counselling or psychological help. This may be important in helping him get into the right attitude for rehab and occupational therapy, hence learning to cope with living."
"I will, thank you for the advice!"
"HDB loans are covered by mortgage insurance for TPD (total permanent disability) for situations like that.CPF has Dependant Protection Scheme of $46000 for TPD too. That will help with immediate financial needs.Do approach school for help. The most important contribution you can make to your family is to continue in your studies. In the long run your income will be an asset.And as the others have said, support and care for each other."
"Go find a part time job after O levels. Although it's just a month, just jobs and earn as much money as you can (of course within your means). 1 month of salary of even about 1k will help your family a lot and you can use it to buy future books and meals in your tertiary studies (jc/poly etc). If you do end up in poly, pick up a part time job. Study well so you can receive scholarship or subsidies from the school which will make a difference to your household finance. Sounds like a big thing to do, but once you started you will realise it will also help you become more independent and strong. At this point, no jobs yet. Make sure you focus on studying well and supporting your mum, dad's emotions and be there for them. Don't create unnecessary trouble and set goals for yourself. Must be hard for you now since you are barely 16. Stay strong and I wish you all the best"

If you had insurance (I assume u do), the compensation is quite a huge some of at least 50-100k, should be enough to help ur family thru this. Try talking to your dad & contact ur agent ASAP to file the claim. He might not be in the mood to discuss but THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT! (Some insurance claims require u to report to them within a time frame!) pls help up vote this so that TS can see!!"
"His leg got infected after a holiday. It worsened due to a medical condition he has since birth. But he is under Medishield, so it’s helping. Thanks for the suggestion!"
"Medishield covers your medical expense. I am referring to any personal accident insurance/ life term insurance? For loss of limb, there will be a one-time pay out , depending on your insured amount. This sum of money should be able to support your family at least 5-10 years down the road. Pls check with your mum and dad on this ASAP. this could make a life and death difference for your family."
"No unfortunately. Due to his condition since birth, he can’t be covered by insurance"
Try talking to your teachers then head to your mp?
Already did. Thanks!
"Just keep your head up, do your best in school, make the right friends. Things will work out fine. Stay positive okayyyy."
Hey i may not be able to offer any tips or advice but i can try and help u in schoolwork to my best ability at least! Im sure some redditors here are quite educated too!!All fall in and help our friend in need!
"Same, I'm only a few years older than you, and I still have my chem and some phys notes for o levels, if you want them hmu and I'll send you a copy :))"
don’t give up my friend. Even this will pass and there will always be hope as long as you don’t give up and be positive. thoughts and prayers with you.
"Hi, lots of financial advice given here, I hope that helps you out. Not to worry too much, you’re not alone in this. Surely you must feel real stressed out now - I have been there myself. Just sharing my similar experience here - my dad had a stroke that left him paralysed so he couldn’t and he lived in an elderly home. We could claim the Dependent Protection Scheme which was quite a lot and I was also eligible for financial assistance in school (didn’t have to submit any documents I remember, my JC principal very kindly helped me out) I got meal coupons and free notes (we had to pay for printing then) so my pocket money in school was more or less covered. On the psychological aspect of things - I felt very sad everyday but watching CNA insider - about heartwarming stories of people going through the same situation as me helped me out a lot. My counsellor helped too. It hurts but it passes. Since you’re taking your O levels this year do study well (or even take time off if you think that’s necessary and take it the next year)? Discuss these options with your form teacher / counsellor. Sending lots of love your way <3"
"So sorry to hear that, must be tough especially when you’re younger.I believe there are schemes from family service centre or community care (something like that). I currently use it too and they help to pay my utility bills. It’s small but I’ll take what I can get.Since you’re still in sec sch, do contact your form teacher or so. I believe there are ways in which they can help.Above all, don’t lose yourself to despair. Rmb to study hard and smart. If you do well you can at least eliminate your parents’s worries for higher education fees.Stay strong, and hope you and your fam get through this."
"Since everyone here already gave you such great advice , just follow what you think is the best but I just felt like I needed to say this . Good luck and all the best . I hope everything goes well . I know it’s stressful time but I’m sure you got this"
stay strong buddy!
"Hey, check out ComCare or visit your nearest Social Service Office in your area, explain to them your situation and they will help you out. Visit the MP in your area for more assistance.Alot of help is available, you just gotta know where to look and have a little bit of patience.Help in basic necessities, hdb and utilities payments, school funds, pocket money and other kind of assistance is all available.Another advice : I know some parents want to ""save face"" or have pride in asking for help, if that happens, reason with your family member to heed your advice for help.My family was in a financial situation and was unable to get out of it from said ""save face"" mentality until I knocked some sense into my mom. There is no shame in seeking out for help if needed.Wish you all the best in overcoming these trying times."
i don’t know enough to give you advice but just wanted to cheer you on! :) please don’t give up on your studies! you are a very strong and positive individual. may all these troubles tide over for your family. jiayous! :-)
"I am assuming you are still a minor. Your parents must handle these difficulties by them selves. So if, as other suggestions here, FSC and others, they must apply for it. You can can not as a minor.The best you can do is take the house chores and other responsibilities. And most importantly, focus on your studies. Things are tough now, but if you are in a better position financially in 5 years, you will be able to help them more.They will not blame you for not helping them now. If you can, get a job. Every little bit of money will help in the short term. But the number one priority for you and your family is your future."
"Stay strong! Regarding financial aid, how old is your father? If he is 68 and above, and if your father may be considered mild/severely disabled (a doctor will have to certify it), the main caretaker (your mom?) will be eligible for a caretakers grant of 300-500$ / month depending on the scheme he falls under (check silverpages.sg). If your granddad is also staying with you, and he has some degree of disability, he too may be eligible for grants.Also, your family can consider downsizing the home if necessary, sometimes it can make a huge difference to the sole breadwinner if the housing/bills burden is made less with a smaller house. Leave the breaking of sad news to the adults, it is not necessarily your burden alone to take. As you are a student, your main concern now would be do well in school, perhaps really well, so that you can secure scholarships for future studies, these can make you self-sufficient and even help your mom in terms of financial contribution."
"I think everyone here has already given very good advice, but I would just like to add on something. Pay more attention to your dad and show more concern towards him. His quality of life and lifestyle is definitely going to change because of the amputation. You mentioned that he might be depressed so please try to spend more time with him and monitor his mood. Just some personal experience, a few years ago a close family member of mine suffered from a disability due to an accident and from then on, life was never the same for her. To cut a long story short, she got really depressed because of it and unfortunately we underestimated the severity of it until it was too late. So OP, I hope you won't make the same mistake."
"You are really wise, especially for your age!! You deserve so much credit for wanting to step up and it’s really great that you are seeking help.Some people in this thread has given you really great practical advice and I’m just going to add on a little.Personal care for yourself: don’t forget that you are important as well! (:Since you mentioned you are taking O levels, remember to seek help from classmates and your Teachers. You might not be able to go for/ need tuition but your Teachers can always provide you with extra help. Like one comment said, speak to your teacher privately, they can help. Also, if you have friends who are good in some subjects that you aren’t, approach them for help. They should be willing to do that.Take care of yourself. If you don’t mind, you can always share some of your troubles with friends that you trust/ a counsellor. It’s important to unload all the emotions outside of people who are in the situation (aka your family).At the same time, communicate more with your parents. Not sure if you’re close, but it doesn’t hurt to offer more help or a shoulder or a hug!! Hugs are great for communicating without saying it out.Remember it’s always okay to cry! Crying helps to make you feel better.You can always speak to your MP about your situation as well. They might be able to offer temporary help for your situation even if you are not eligible for certain schemes.I wish you and your family all the best!! Sending major hugs ❤️❤️❤️ you can do this!!!"
"Maybe you can approach the hospital for financial assistance as well and see what they can do for you. At least they can advise you on all the available options. Did your father have any insurance before this?As for approaching your father, it takes time for him to come to terms with his situation. Maybe start small by showing that you care by doing small stuff for him and giving him a hug (if that's not too awkward) or warm smile. Arrange with the social worker to see if he can go for counseling sessions. Maybe see if you can interest him in a new hobby you can do together, if time permits. Sometimes simple things can make a huge difference. Let him know you're there for him.Jiayou! Hope you and your family get through this together and come out stronger! Can pm me if you need to vent sometimes :)"
He is under Medishield. Thanks for the words of encouragement!
"Not practical advice but I hope you’ll gradually learn to see the good things in life and amongst all the other responsibilities that you have to step up to now, I’d advice that you don’t lose focus on your studies and taking care of yourself. Press on!!"
"Hey, just a suggestion: It’s probably way too early now but at the risk of sounding callous, losing a leg does not mean that dad can’t contribute financially. There’s a prosthetic facility in Tan Tock Seng Hospital called TTSH foot care and limb centre. When i did my placement there, i fabricated prosthesis for patients like your dad, new amputees. And what’s really dope about the place is that it’s a multi- disciplinary clinic. I could be wrong but once a week they run a clinic where new patients are seen by the doctors, social worker, physio, the podiatrist and the prosthetist. There they will assess your dad and come up with the best treatment. I’m not too sure how you get a referral to that clinic, but I’m certain if you give them a call they will point you on the right path. And i won’t lie, it will be tough in the beginning. There is no catch all advice that will be sufficient, but know that everything will work out in the end. Rooting for you and your family!"
Pls take good care and stay strong for your parents. Always remember you are stronger than u think!
"Coming from someone with a similar experience (exams+ my dad in ICU), I'm very sorry I can't give much useful advice but with regards to feeling lost and hopeless, it can be considered a form of escapism but perhaps you can consider burying yourself with your studies since like you said, your Os are coming up. Better to have something to distract your attention from what is happening than to constantly ponder about what is going to happen and feel lost and hopeless over it. I'm sorry I can't provide any useful advice but OP pls stay strong and take good care of yourself and your mum and try not to let these issues distract you too much from your studies.Ps Take note that, tensions might inadvertently flare up due to the stress your mum might be in and the frustration your dad will most likely feel but try to be a understanding and accommodating about it."
"Okay, I will. Hope your father is doing well now! Thank you!"
"Maybe help your dad find work, he can do plenty of work with one leg, and it will make him feel better."
Maybe can check whether your father still insured under DPS? Or maybe eldershield.
"To help your financial situation, im quite sure you can talk to your teachers to help apply for financial aid from sch, government and even your racial group thingy (CDAC) if youre chinese for your sch fees!"
"Poly can loan your fees. All you need is to worry about your own expenses (computer etc) transport.You can try working part time? Talk to the mp, there are more schemes to help families like yours."
"Hi - I will just add three things since most things have already been said.If at any point in time, you face an issue that requires legal advice or help, you can go to the Legal Aid Bureau at the URA East Wing at Maxwell Road. There are also free legal clinics at Community Centres and other places (google for this).If you need more specific help, come back here and ask. r/singapore will find a way to help.It seems to me that you are quite mature and responsible even at a relatively young age. Your parents are fortunate to have you as their child. I am sorry you have to go through this at this stage of your life. Take care of yourself."
Go n seek help from your MP. He will sort it out for you. Just concentrate on your studies.

Those must be some sexy bikes.
That’s a common myth. The northern guns were all pointing in the right direction.
Except they were loaded with AP rounds
"How bloody long does it take to reload HE once they realised Yamashita was barrelling down from Thailand? Those things could nearly hit the Sultan's palace. Contrary to popular belief, the Japanese Army won fair and square. They had the better force. Hell even old frag rounds would've been enough."
They just didn't have enough HE shells stored and a fuckton of AP rounds.
That's positive
"The guns facing the sea are able to traverse and fire north, but the ammunition they had was AP for targetting ships and not HE to deal with troops or light armour"
"Right on the money. It still puzzles me that many are still perpetuating the myth that the guns were all in the wrong direction.We had plenty of guns in the right direction, just loaded with the wrong type of ammo."
When i was in school the books all said the same thing. Only the internet taught this.Kind of stupid if you think about it: why would no effort be made to traverse the guns north in 1942 when the enemy was banging at your rear gate?
"It still puzzles me that many are still perpetuating the myth that the guns were all in the wrong direction.Not surprising, this was what people were taught. Also see the prevalence of catchy songs as above. Unless people purposely go to find out online it's unlikely they'll be corrected anyway"
we had a shit commander
"Percival was alright, really. Just a more defensive temperament. Now the Australian commander, now that guy was shite."
"rlly, den why did duff cooper see the need to send churchill a telegram essentially saying that ""percival was a shit commander"" 3 months before we fell?"
Except Duff Cooper was a politician. The shit commander was Bennett.
"correct me if im wrong, but wasn't the aussies deployed on the beaches of sarimbun, which was also an area not expected to be attacked?"
"They were, and they gave a good showing for newly trained rookies. But Percival made a critical tactical error that caused a premature retreat to the next defensive line. You'll find this happening all across the defence of Singapore."
so percival was a shit commander
"This looks more and more like a troll post. You haven't read enough, obviously. You should go back and refresh yourself on his career, before you start trying to spread clearly unsupported statements. For starters, why not read up on how he correctly identified the inadequacy of Singapore's buildup and the likely avenue of Yamashita's strike. The whole southern thing our social studies propagates is complete rubbish."
OMG I forgot the song until now. I have to listen to it again
“Sir! Our scout reports that Singapore is occupied by white men with three dicks”
"The woman depicted where Singapore is might be a reference to Singapore's booming prostitution industry during that time. Many of the sex workers were Japanese and were mostly plying their trade in brothels located along Malay, Malabar and Hylam Streets at Bugis, where Bugis Junction currently sits."
"Interesting insight. I heard that Singapore used to have a booming underground/lgbt culture, is this also true?"
"Yeah I've seen articles about that some time ago. There was even a movie called Bugis Street which delved into the lives of the transgenders in Singapore.I think acknowledgement of the transgender is not actually new in local context. The Malays have had a long history of the Mak Nyah, and from an article I read, the Bugis acknowledge three sexes (female, male, hermaphrodite), four genders (women, men, calabai, and calalai), and a fifth meta-gender group, the bissu.Unfortunately I have no knowledge of Singapore having a booming LGB culture in the past, though that might just be my own ignorance and lack of research into those matters. Would love to hear about it if anyone has any info on that."
"Transgender in the old days is just gay and lesbian, there never was LGBTQR+ like what we had today."

I like that if you scroll to the New York area you see a filthy capitalist who kinda looks like Trump.
Indeed
Thanks for linking the original! Fascinating stuff :)
Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere intensify.
Lol that image of Hitler and Hindenburg doing a waltz is burned in my mind
Jakarta is filled with 'chinamen' that got bags of money. lol
I imagine this was something given to or for kids.
Someone explain to me whats the story behind Japanese migrants coming to Argentina?
"Argentina specifically I not sure, but Brazil in particular had pretty good ties with the Japanese and some workers in lowyielding plots of farmland (mountainous areas) were essentially heavily encouraged to migrate to Brazil. So even today there's a heavy mixed presence there, and according to my Brazillian friend, they've got the best of both worlds - Japanese face, but thicc Brazillian asses. I'm guessing some just ended up dispersing southwards towards Argentina.If you want to do more academic reading, search terms would include Brazillian nisei (二世, or 2nd gen)."
I’ll need some reference materials for them thicc Japanese-faced ladies please. For science.
"Hahah this was from word of mouth a couple of years back, so no pics. Do us all a favor and write a FR if you go to Brazil ;)"
"Actually Japan used to have a history of immigration to South America in general. Heres an old poster of ""Join your Family, Let's go to South America."" One of the president of Peru was Japanese, Alberto Fujimori."
No idea Japanese was also written right to left until I tried to read all that katakana and it didn't make sense.
Took me longer that I'm willing to admit to figure that out.
"Lol they don't know the difference between different races in southeast asia. On the guy wearing a songkok, it says chinaman."
Don't see any songkok leh
"The katakana there says ""ruupoganshi"", I wonder that that means?"
Try reading it backwards from right to left haha
FUCK
What does it say?
It says シンガポール/Singapore haha
Hahaha!
Looks like they predicted Crazy Rich Asians under a parasol

"Hi, I'm 15 years old and I'm moving to Singapore this summer from Finland. I visited this summer but only stayed for 3 days and the difference is immense. I'm part Asian so I won't really stick out but I know there's a lot of diversity and different ethniticies and cultural differences. Nowadays almost all societies have their own ""hidden rules"" if you will and I was hoping to discuss and learn some of it here.I would say 3 days isn't enough to learn all of this and I'd like to refrain from making avoidable embarrassing and/or awkward situations happen. My mother has been telling me a lot of things as: ""Don't touch someone's head"" or ""You can't buy chewing gum"". I know the obvious but I'm sure there's more to it than a top 10 list on the internet. If you could help me out I'd appreciate it.My father moved a couple of months ago but is currently staying at a smaller apartment and we'll pick a bigger one once my mother and I move, the location will be based on which school I will attend. We're moving because my father was offered a promotion. The contract is for 2 years and I'll be attending an IB school so I can continue my studies back here. We will fly to Singapore next week to visit some schools as we already have planned multiple interviews. Thanks in advance!Edit: Added a bit more info."
"What you read on the internet is highly exaggerated. I believe as long as you keep an open mind, listen more and observe more, you will realise that Singapore is a melting pot of different cultures. I will say that we are generally pretty friendly though we may not look like it. It’s easy to make friends here as we are good host.Get used to the transportation system, food and importantly the killer weather. The rest will take care of itself and you will start to appreciate the difference.If you need to be assimilated, let me know. There’s a group of us that can take you and your mum around.Welcome to Singapore."
"Thanks, I already have a cousin showing me around but thank you for the offer. So far I think it's a beautiful country but unfortunately I find the weather unbearable. Your suggestions have been a great help!"
Lived here my entire life and I think the weather is unbearable. The good thing is there is tons of air-conditioned places here
"Oh, I agree. Walking in to an air conditioned room is like walking in to a wall."
"Most of the time, people here are understanding regarding mistakes/ unfamiliarity and rather helpful. But singaporeans are similar to norwegians, appear to be cold and unfriendly on the outside. Of course once you start talking to them, the awkwardness subsides :)"
"As someone who has been to Finland, I'd say that they're surprisingly culturally similar countries. People keep to themselves but are helpful if approached. Physical contact isn't a huge thing here, unless you're close to the person. Sporadically talking to strangers also doesn't really occur, except with taxi drivers.Some things you might need to prepare yourself for might be city-life itself and having a geographical boundary around a city.For the first, if you're from Helsinki, you're probably used to crowds and rush hour traffic / public transportation. In Singapore, the trains/buses get a lot more crowded but you might not have to face this too much if you're schooling. The crowded areas in downtown places are a lot denser and bigger than the worst I experienced in Helsinki.For the second, Finland has amazing places to enjoy nature. We have a few reservoirs that you can do a few hours trek around at the most. Camping or full day hikes up mountains is not something you can do here. Escaping the city is also not as easy, we literally have more city area than rural. You have the islands you can take a ferry too. Malaysia is a short trip away too (but not as safe as Finland).Singapore is very hot and humid with a lot of rain, so unless you're exercising, people don't usually hang out outside. I believe others have mentioned we have a mall culture. You won't find any open markets or farmers markets (we barely have farms too) here.You mentioned you're going to an IB school. I'm assuming that since your father has moved here for work, you're going to be attending an international school which is very different from the local schools. (I went local, have friends from international and have tutored students from both). You'll probably have a lot more non-singaporean/international friends there. The school system might be more tedious and grade based than you're used to (but this depends on the school, some are harder than others). Good thing about IB is that the top IB schools in the world is in Singapore (ACS Independent - a local school), so if you need resources, you can easily find good tutors who will know the material for the main subjects."
"Wow, this was really helpful. The area I live in is quite rural and there's a LOT of forest. My father grew up on a farm hunting fox and mink etc. And I feel like he wants me to grow up like a ""man"" like him chopping firewood for the winters, fixing a moped, driving a tractor etc. I've been to Helsinki and it's quite different from the area I live in but this definitely helps me understand it a little bit more. The main problem we've been having is finding a tutor for both Finnish and Swedish and for the subjects to be the same the year I move back to Finland or I'll simply have to wait a year, I'm hoping for the best though. Thanks!"
"Glad I could help!After reading your reply, I realised that one thing that might be a bit of a culture shock is the concept of masculinity here. To a certain extent gender equality in schools is pretty decent (not so much in the workplace), so while I would mention this, it's more to provide some historical context. A lot of this might not applicable to a lot of people nowadays. (International schools might differ).Essentially, compared to Western countries, asian masculinity is not generally defined by physical strength, looks or attitude. We have traditional gender roles - women looking after kids, men providing - that people still conform to sometimes. But masculinity here is more defined by morals and ability to provide for family. Historically speaking that is, no one will think of you as less of a man for failing an exam. But you'll have lots of school boys not bothered about ""looking"" or ""acting"" manly as you know it. I have straight up showed international friends videos of my friends shenanigans in school and have received comments that the school boys seem ""girly"" to them. The concept of a ""macho"" man is not a thing here. While calling someone girly will still be perceived as an insult, a lot of people won't understand why you think so.Feel free to ask me anything else. I'm not currently living there, but do miss Sg and would love to talk about it."
This was completely new to me. Fortunately I don't know what else I should ask. Thank you so much!
"""Don't touch someone's head""That's Thailand. No such taboo here, but we don't go around touching strangers' heads either.Singapore is a highly westernized country, apart from adapting to the weather I don't think you have to worry too much about anything else, especially since you will be studying at an international school. IMO, the life of an international student and that of a local is totally different. Just be civilized and act within local laws. There is nothing to worry about."
"Ignore most things, don't react to anything, no matter how ridiculous in public. See someone with a ridiculous hairstyle, ignore. See a little girl carrying a cute stuffed animal? Don't say anything, not even a ""aww thats cute"". Everyone will be doing the same."
"I think (hope) this was intended to be a bit sarcastic, but you will find that most people will just keep their heads down (usually nose in phone) and avoid confrontation at all costs. Doesn't mean you have to actively ignore the world around you though. Strangers may be a little surprised if you engage with them, but will usually get over it pretty quickly and be friendly"
"From what (little) I know about Finns, they're already like that lol."
"You’re asking him to be a robot, without a battery."
That's just not true
Hmm.. I wouldn't have expected this to be a thing but thank you very much!
Actually Finns should be already experts at this. :)
"Singapore is a pretty easy going country. The only thing you have worry about is getting some friends or a social circle once you are here. Everything else is pretty straight forward.Some nuances,as somebody mentioned, chope culture to reserve seatsfood court culture, most families do not cook at home. All meals are eaten outside.Malls are open until 11pm, people tend to spend a lot of time at Mallslight pollution is quite high due to the size and density of the countryGet used to the humidity, get used to the rain.mornings ain’t that fresh as it’s a tropical countrysun comes up sharp at 7am, goes down at 7pm. All year round. It’s uncanny.people are not that racist but there is xenophobia that you would come across every now and then.it’s Super clean.a new tourist attraction comes up every 3-4 years. Its kinda cool.By all means move here for a few years as it’s great for a multi cultural experience as Singapore is a melting pot of many cultures, food, tastes and styles. You would love it!"
"Wow, thanks! I'm mostly familiar with the weather at this point. Do you know anything about the stereotypical competitive students? My mother has been telling me I need to do even better because it's a very developed country etc. Wondering if it's as tough as she makes it seem. My grades are above average at the moment and I could get in to most schools in ovet here but I'm not too sure about Singapore considering the amount of students in each school."
"I'm not sure how the culture is in the international schools.It is quite competitive in local schools, mainly because of the focus on grades. That being said, if really is up to you how much you want to let it get to you.My opinion is that you should try your best to enjoy school and enjoy learning. Make friends you would keep for life, do your best. Might sound cliché, but lots of things are more important than grades."
"As a student in a government sch, we are usually chill with academics. You can see that in the top schs but when exam season comes, shit gets real and we mug like until the cow comes home. But you will have other things such as CCAs in sch and leadership stuff you may try. If you are going to ACS IB, your mates are all dudes"
"My mother has been telling me I need to do even better because it's a very developed country etc.Don't worry, once you live here for a while you'll hear Singaporeans complain, ""we're a developed country on the surface with 3rd world mentalities, why can't we be like the real first world countries in Scandinavia!"""
You should be okay if you are planning to go to the private or international school. The curriculum is designed to be inline with international standards.
"If you look asian, some people might think you're chinese and try to speak to you in chinese. Don't be alarmed or afraid to let them know that you can only speak english."
Hi I'm a Finnish person living in Singapore I would highly recommend checking out the Singaporen Suomalaiset Facebook page lots of info there on almost everything. You should be able to find tutoring through there and I think there is even a Finnish school that operates few hours a day if I'm correct:)
"Given that you are relatively young, if you are sitting in the MRT when an old person/pregnant lady/disabled person comes in, you should try to offer your seat to the person (especially when wearing your school uniform).Use ""Uncle/Auntie"" instead of ""Sir/Madam""Do not discuss politics, especially when taking cabs/GrabI can only think of these three right now. I hope it helps!"
"Thanks! I noticed some different colored seats in the MRT, I'm assuming that this is what you're referring to. I have a cousin who has been living there for a while, she's been showing me around."
"the seats near the door, has a label on the wall called reserved seats, try to NOT sit on them at all. You may get some unnecessary trouble/arguement from those entitled elderlies (uncle/aunty) which is quite common here"
"Chope culture, If you see tissue / umbrella on empty table at food court / hawker centre , mean the seat have been reserved."
Hopefully this will save me from an embarrassing encounter. Thanks!
"Be prepared for Singlish, our locally colloquial slang. It's going to sound hella weird and I can't make a whole dictionary for you right now. Just know that Singaporeans aren't gonna sound eloquent and use incorrect grammar casually. If you don't understand the slangs you can just ask someone else about it (someone close to you, not a random stranger) and you don't have to feel compelled to use them as most Singaporeans understand proper English too. People just like using Singlish as it makes you sound more loose with your friends."
"best language ever, but don’t anyhow use without knowing the exact meaning, don’t mistake lanjiao for lajiao and laojiao (Penis, chili, old bird(aka vetaran) respectively) These words come from Chinese and Hokkien dialect"
"Taxis - you won't normally be able to hail taxis by the side of the road - there are proper taxis queues to hail cabs.Ridesharing - There is no Uber, only Grab and Go-Jek. Ymmv.Public transport - Buses are awesome. Cheap, cold and convenient. Except during rush hour in the CBD.Singaporean snacks - Aim to try at least once: Salted egg potato chips, salted egg fish skin, chili crab seaweed snacks, pineapple tarts, bak kwa.Singaporean coffee - there is a language for customising your kopi. Iced black coffee is Kopi O Kosong Peng :)There's a very high level of religious tolerance. July/August is Hungry Ghost month. Try to not jostle any fruit or incense you see on the ground.14 public holidays in Singapore and if the public holiday falls on a Sunday, we get Mondays off.Singaporean food can be awesomely spicy.All the best! We're always happy to help!"
"It's 7am Saturday here so most people won't be up yet. Perhaps you'll like to tell us a bit more about yourself, like how long you'll be here for, the area you'll be in, whether be enrolling in a school or not, etc."
"Thanks, I updated the post."
"Try searching moving, relocation, expat etc and similar keywords on this sub. You'll find posts like this which might be helpful."
"Thanks, I'll take a look it."
"all due respect, i think you don't have to worry about the social norm and integrating with the locals. the school you will be studying is most likely an international school with many foreign expats like you. you will probably hang out with a mix of american, europeans, indian, japanese, korean, etc. people from all over the world. Tbh, unless you worked a part-time job or contiune study in a local university, your social circle will consist of mainly foreign expats like yourself. Since the contract for your dad is only 2 years, treat it as a ""Summer school"" kind of experience and enjoy yourself. Don't worry about how the locals will judge you and stuff.. be yourself and enjoy your time exploring Singapore!"
"Mathematically, there's actually more foreigners than Singaporeans in Singapore."
"Anywhere in the world there are just simple rules for the initial period: Be respectful, respect personal spaces, respect privacy and think before you share your opinions or jokes, you’ll be fine. The rest of the things are all just customs learnt through experience, don’t sweat it."

No problem! My inbox is always open if you have other questions :)
"Respect everyone religion in this country is the most important thing. In Singapore, it normal for the Chinese to burn incense at designated area, loud “live music” during funeral(for Chinese)and wedding(for Malay) or even your Tamil neighbor cooking curry. Always show tolerance and never try to do stupid thing like taking video and try to shame them in Facebook etc ( trust me , people try and it never go well for them). As Singapore is such a small country , always be careful of your own behavior outside and not to be the next “star” online. Search for “go jek kidnap Singapore” for example."
"Thanks, I don't really use social media like Facebook or Instagram. I try to be as accepting as possible. I've had multiple looks and racial slurs thrown at me during my time here and it's not that pleasant at all (adults and children). I wouldn't wish that upon anybody."
Just don’t do anything stupid enough to be on STOMP
Or NOS and it’s variants
Regarding schooling - what grades would you be here in Singapore for?
"Hm, I'm not quite sure to be honest but I'm born in 2003 and I would be attending high school this summer if I were to stay in Finland. So PreDP + 1 year"
"Thanks for the suggestion but I won't be graduating from Singapore. I will continue the remaining year in Finland, all I need to do really is find a school that has the same curriculum as the one in Finland. Thank you."
I have a classmate who’s half Finnish

"hello working adults and polytechnic graduates, im currently a student underoing y2 of my polytechnic life right now. At the start of the diploma life i messed up the first few semesters due to some problems in life. Currently, my CGPA is at 2.3 ish and i realised even if i were to get 3.0,4.0,4.0 for the next three semesters respectively, I would only get a 2.9. If so can i know how much of a big role does GPA actually play in finding a job after diploma and NS? Also, are there ways to improve my chances of getting a better job rather than just my gpa?"
"Hello! Graduated in 2014, been working full time ever since then. My situation was similar to yours, I had 2.9 in my first semester and even a subsequent 4.0 wasn't enough to pull my CGPA up substantially.I started working since I had no clue what I wanted for a degree (private was the only option for me as my CGPA was only 3.2), but I would say employers who hire diploma graduates generally do not care about grades but more so about the experience you had. One important factor to consider is the industry though, like what diploma are you studying now?"
"sorry i forgot to mention that, im in the IT department, more specifically InfoSec"
"Infosecurity is a very hot area now because of Government and private sector's continued push into digital / cyber security. If you have a diploma in Network Systems Security or Information Security from any of the local polys, you have no problems finding a job in Singapore especially if you are a Singaporean Citizen as the MHA/Mindef/GovTech needs people like you. Consider certifications like CISSP, CISA, CISM, SANS and related certifications. Now there are many."
thanks! will look into them
Pretty sure itsec government jobs require degree minimum
"I was in your position before, I did really badly in my first semester and it was slightly below 2.0, and graduated with a 3.0. Luckily for me, I was really interested in the InfoSec so manage to score a few As and even a distinction. My lecturer decided to place me in Big 4 to do PT during my final year internship. Although my grades were not satisfactory, I felt that most importantly is to do what you enjoy, and with that rewards you with experience. You might want to consider taking certification like OSCP and CREST as they are a requirement now days."
alright thanks a lot!
"Ah, I don't have credible information, but I heard that one of my ex schoolmates is earning more than another friend who is a fresh grad (said friend was complaining). He's in a foreign MNC apparently?"
"so i guess the better option way for me to get a job is via foreign MNCs? Also, sorry to bother you but is it possible to check what foreign MNC is the person under?"
I will try! Not too close to either of them though.
thanks a lot !!
May I ask how much are you making?
Sure! My last drawn was 2.7.
nice
"Thanks! It's more than enough for me for now as I have income coming elsewhere, but I'm considering getting a part time degree now that things are stabilized."
cool
"Lots of agency (ST / NC$ /etc) looking for underpaid contract jobs, so don’t worry about it. Full time with benefits and good salary though...Also, CECA for infosec. Even with average gpa don’t go to local companies / Mnc. Apply to them and practice interview with them (see what technical questions asked, etc). By practicing with those local companies, aim for European / America Mnc who will pay fair wage and not based on paper.Local company pay by paper which mean in same team doing same job can have different pay grade. Get the fear of failing interview out by going through with local (st, nc$), it will better prepare you for actual job interview that you would want to get.Maybe, can try applying ntu ? They’re expanding their intake through holistic approach, maybe build up on your portfolio."
alright thanks! just to check what is CECA?
"IT sector - Talents with fake degrees from India on a higher salary.Also, infosec has different specialization which you may want to start considering and take on certification. Actual job search, certification is higher value than diploma and some companies give monthly incentive / bonus to your salary."
"Hey OP, work life after Poly is a pretty sharp dive (source, am currently in the same situation, graduated with 2.75, cleared my NS, then took the step into working life).Depends on the employer/HR that is going through your transcripts & what they are looking for really. Some employers may overlook your GPA in favour for other traits/qualities you have that they + you will need for the job you are applying for.What you can consider doing will be to beef up your resume with projects or internships. Also, try to get a character reference or two (normally your boss from prior internships/work experience), someone that can put in a good word for you when your potential employer calls your former workplaces.Side note, be prepared to answer questions on 'why didn't you go Uni?' I can tell you, this is a question that'll recur a LOT. From interviewers, to colleagues, to your relatives. People will say 'eh Poly go work CMI', but that's not true. Maybe you'll take a pay cut, maybe you'll start lower, but it's not impossible to find a job with your Poly diploma."
alright thanks a lot do you guys know other ways to improve resumes other than certificates mentioned?
"Case by case depending on your Diploma, but internships are a pretty good point to consider if certs aren't your thing. Besides, the work experience you gain will also teach you 'soft skills' for office survival.School projects, not a certificate-awarding matter but if you did really well (i.e. industry endorsement, top grades), you can consider including it in your resume. (IMPORTANT: if you want to do this, make sure you preserve your project information so it is in a presentable format)"
"If it was just distraction that made you get that score, can still try applying part time while working.I thought it's a fluke but fucking 3 of my friends got 2.5-2.8 for their job offer haven't even start workthey applied for NTU eng part time and just got it. No interview no test no nothin.Probably still a fluke"
well thats reassuring and yeah it was just distractions due to family and relationship issues. thanks a lot!
There's recent news about NUS offering work-study schemes. maybe go check that out too! ST news article featured someone with 2.x GPA getting in.
okay will do
Whut really? I was always under the impression NUS was completely FT
theres still people who wants you. maybe they gna pay you 100-200 less
"I have shaky hands and can't really apply this kind of things myself. So I'm looking for a place where they sell tempered glass at a reasonable price and has the experience in applying the screen protector for the Switch.EDIT: Thanks for all the recommendations, went to get it done at GameMartz, even though it was overpriced. Wanted to stop worrying about getting it scratched asap."
GameMartz
Do you know what's their pricing? I was just thinking about Sim Lim if no one replied.
Not really sure. I didn't buy a Switch with them... my experience was with a 3DS XL. They do have reasonable prices though and the service is usually great.
"Aite, thanks for the info probably gonna go there."
I already blew my first attempt. Now I have a screen that has dust under the protector and I don't know if I've damaged the glass with compressed air or my hand sanitizer.
"When you mentioned glass are you referring to the screen protector? Because the switch screen is made of plastic. Also, why was hand sanitizer involved?Anyway as someone with tremors I often have trouble applying screen protector too, but retailers charge way too much to apply screen protectors so I have to do it myself, which only cost like $3. Here’s how I usually apply mine:Go to a relatively dust free area, switch off any fan you have on.Use the wet swab first and let it dry abit and use the dry swab. These are usually included with the protector. The dry swab may leave behind a oily layer which doesn’t affect anything visually after the protector is applied.Use a torchlight to inspect the screen for dust. A light source is important as some dust particle may not be visible without it. Use a scotch tape or the included sticky tape to remove any dust. This is crucial as you do not want to remove the glass after it’s placed.Remove the plastic cover on the tempered glass and hold the four edges and align them onto the screen.Anyway try to avoid using the dock before you manage to get a screen protector. It may leave scratches on the screen as it’s made of plastic."
"I think I already got a scratch on the screen but its minor and didn't notice it while testing Mario cart. Also thanks for the info. I thought that since my hand sanitizer is mostly liquid and alcohol it could clean the screen, the hand sanitizer is the watery kind not the gel kind. I used it before on my phone for the Samsung gear vr without any issues. Damn didn't know the screen was plastic."
Try using 70% isopropyl alcohol swabs instead if the screen protector you buy didn’t come with any swab. You can find them at Guardian or Watson. Not sure about your hand sanitizer but those I know of always got a sticky residue. But since you used before it might not be the issue. Yeap it’s made of plastic probably because Nintendo don’t want cracked screens when people drop their switch. A temporary fix would be to put a thin cloth over the front of the dock. The insides of the front of the dock got two protruding plastics that may scratch the screen. All the best!
"Unlike most phone or tablet screens the Switch actually has a plastic screen which is extremely prone to scratching, even by keys or coins."
"Not really related, but may I know how long again you bought your switch and how much you paid for it? I’m hoping to buy one for my sister on her birthday and I’m not sure what’s a good price for it. Thanks!"
"I don't know if people like getting things from qoo10 here but that's where I got mine. Bought it on February 2nd, it just arrived today, and qoo10 had a Chinese new year coupon sale. So the switch itself was $416 with accessories, like a screen protector and joycon protectors and such. The coupon allowed you to reduce the price by $58 so I only paid $358 for the switch and some simple accessories."
"Thanks! Oh boy, I think I missed it."
"Most game stores generally will apply the protector for you when you purchase it, in my experience. But if you want a recommendation, you can try qisahn at Far East Shopping Center. I know they do apply the tempered glass protector for you when you buy it there."
"Not always, sometimes they do apply for you but it’s not guaranteed. There was one time I went down to buy one for my 3ds and the guy said he didn’t know how to. I was very annoyed."
Qishan
Gamewerkz at clementi does a good job
"I'm not the best at applying screen protectors as well but use tape like mt tape to secure one edge of the protector to the device before you remove the film for the adhesive side.That saves you all the trouble in eyeballing and aligning.Once it's secure, flip it away from the screen, clean the device to your heart's content, remove film and flip it back."
"37M here, born and bred in Singapore, never studied overseas and don’t even have a diploma. I used to be an army regular worked in a bar after. I run my own creative agency now, married with no kids, live in a resale HDB and take public transport to work.I’m noticing a growing segment of vocal and angry Singaporeans on social media. They are critical at everything—politicians, telcos, a passenger they know nothing about in a Grab car—and critical thinkers are distancing themselves away from this.It’s both astonishing and frustrating. I’m neither a fan of politicians or mainstream media nor am I entertained by the noise from the people.What is going on and what can we do?"
"I met a toilet cleaner in China while I was on an extended work trip. She was a local in her mid-forties and she cleaned the office building toilets. So there is something you need to know about these toilets. These toilets cannot flush toilet paper. The toilet bowl will jam if you toss paper in. So enter me, with my Singaporean toilet paper tossing ways. Somehow or the other, I managed to forget that fact a number of times and jam up the toilet bowl with toilet paper... and other stuff. I am always abashed and I always apologize to the cleaner lady in person. It was extremely embarrassing to ask her to clean up a toilet bowl jammed with my crap.So this is where I was always taken aback at the cleaner's reaction.This lady cleaner was perfectly happy and cheerful every time I inform her that she had to unjam a disgusting, crap-filled toilet bowl. Most people have a baseline default emotion. You can tell whether their normal emotional state is content, angry or sad etc. This cleaner lady, however, was perfectly content with her life cleaning up other people's crap. I observed her a number of times. She wasn't putting on a facade or an act.I still remember her cheerful face after so many years. Time and time again, I come across people like her, who got handed a bad deck of cards in life, who should be angry and resentful at their station in life, but weren't. Instead, what they exude was a feeling of acceptance and even contentment. All in a hard day's work and all that.And then I come across many people whose baseline emotion was anger and resentment. They are not happy with their lives. This phenomenon cuts across classes. I sense this in the foodcourt cleaners in Singapore. I feel it with condo-dwellers I've met.My conclusion after so many years of observing people is that some people think they deserve better. It doesn't actually matter what situation they are in. They could be very poor or very rich. If they are not content with what they have, if they think they deserve better than whatever situation they are in right now, they will be bitter, angry and resentful."
Singaporean-toilet-paper-tossing-waysHaha. No wonder our NEWater has a tinge of single ply pulp.
Gotta reuse the fiber somehow
"Good for digestion, no need buy those dietary fibre supplements"
That's the first gen one.Nowadays NeWater taste even more tasteless than tapwater
Off-topic but since you brought it up. What’s the deal with toilets that you can’t throw paper in? I encountered this in Taipei too. It’s not like the technology doesn’t exist.
"The sewage system is taiwan is the older ones, cannot flush toilet paper.Source: every morning I had to find a train toilet to shit, because I didn't want to stink up my air bnb host bin in the toilet with my shit haha"
Considerate. You deserve all the Airbnb points.
They should atleast install a bidet
"Bidet is such a luxury. I don't care about your gold-plated toilet. If you have a bidet, you win all toiletries."
Yes agree with you!It is the perspective we live by - is my glass half full or my glass half empty? I am very contented and my frens said I have always found my glass is full enough even though my glass leaks every now and then. I just fill it again.It is up to the individual to adjust one’s life perspective.
"Hmm very interesting read. Then a question I want to ask is could this mindset be related to our surroundings and environment ? Here in Singapore, we grow up in one of the richest nations and we witness and are surrounded by the infrastructure and lifestye of the rich. Over time we get accustomed to these kind of environments such that when we personally don’t live that way, we develop that mindset (of being angry)Whereas, for your story in China (now I’m making huge assumption here), the area might not be as rich so they don’t strive for a luxurious lifestyle and are totally content with their own.I don’t know I’m just putting down my thoughts here. Still though, in no way am I saying the mindset you talk about is okay. I think we should all thrive to be a bit nicer to everyone. Especially in a stressful environment like SingaporeEDIT: The word is “strive” not “thrive”"
We have the very rich in Singapore to compare ourselves with. But we don't have the very poor in Singapore to see how good we have it. I saw this Youtube video the other day and I pretty much stopped complaining.How your leftover McDonalds is recooked and sold by this family to survive.
Wow. Very true sentiments!
"Agree with you too.Reminded me of a movie Crash where there's a quote from this character called Jean, "" I am angry all the time... and I don't know why. ""Too bad our education system doesn't teach people how to be happy and content. Yeah, everything has to be taught."
"[Spoliers, maybe] Wow. Crash. Isn't that the multi-story film and featured a guy who was racist because his father was rejected of medical care from a black person?"
Nonsense. It has everything to do with technological upheaval and this is not unique to Singaporeans but can be seen across the world. Contentment as a virtue worth pursuing is not untrue but cliche and detracting from reality.
"Pain is inevitable, suffering is s choice."
"Well it’s China where the gov do want you to be content without inspiration. Dreams and demand for better condition is a western liberal thing, which could be dangerous to communist gov.Free market / capitalism, swim or sink.It actually favors the rich for people to be content as they will be class restricted to that role (generations of toilet cleaners, grandfather / father do it and eventually force the son to be content with his ‘fate’ as he don’t deserve better life)"
I have to question your observation. My dad (Malay) serves guests in a hotel his whole life. My mom (Chinese) served nurses. Success favors your perception of it. Ive never subscribed to class restrictions. If it's man-made it can be undone.
"In some context, your values / believe are justified (primarily SG). Not applicable on global scale though, look at countries like China / India. In some counties there are gender class too. It can be a bit condescending to downplay the struggle of others if you were to hold SG mindset everywhere."
"Where is the premise of my post focused on and how does my values, in the context of Singapore, have anything to do with—not just any class, but—gender classes of other countries? Focus on the framing, don’t succumb to banal confusion."
"Your previous comment was that you believe “class restriction is by choice that individual can overcome / undone for success, it’s just a matter of perception”. Sounds good on self help book, not so much in reality / global scale. That comment downplay people suffering from it as if it’s their choice.Eg, metal illnesses. Many seem to think it’s just matter of perception / choice (“how about choose to look at the bright side instead?”). That is wrong and discouraging to those people in need to seek help."
Brave New world isn't it. Only difference being that everyone there is born out of test tubes.
"Dreams are neither Western nor liberal. Heck, all Communist revolutions including the Chinese one started because workers aspired for a better future."
"“Revolution”, not how they suppress you to conform to their ideology. Overlord don’t want people to aspire and dream to overtake them. They want diligent citizen whom they can rule over and control through restricted media / propaganda / regulation."

"This country has been built upon cut-throat competition, no holds barred approach to achieving the absolute best.I was brought up with the mindset that true success equate the 5 Cs. Anything less than 90 (sometimes 95) marks for tests in primary school and I was screwed. I once failed to complete a spelling test and I started bawling my eyes out because I knew I was not going to get a perfect score for it.Thus I grew up to have an expectation for the absolute best in everything I do. And it wasn't just about being at the top. I felt like I needed to do this just to catch up with everyone else. I am sure that I'm not the only person to have experienced something like this.I ended up having depression, partially upon the realisation that in a society like this, the 5 Cs will always be a pipe dream. I felt betrayed and mislead. I felt as if I was, along with people of my generation, sold a Singapore dream which most of us would likely never get.Perhaps these are the reasons that made me a bitter person. Put people of this generation together with the reality of daily life in Singapore: massively crowded trains, stagnant wages, highly competitive workplace, increase in cost of living, and then being shat on for being 'strawberries'. You are going to get a lot of disenchanted, disillusioned, bitter and perhaps even angry, people."
"I kind of had the same upbringing as you (as in the must-have-perfect-score mother) but I have found that when I remove outside factors (like parents) and worked on doing my best and not being the best, I started to have a much happier life. People's success stopped being a bad thing and life stopped being a zero-sum game. I can honestly say I am very happy in Singapore and I don't think I have a very toxic mindset. I might have a little moan here and there but I think I am very contented. I think if you choose not to be a part of the kiasu culture you can and will be less angry and less toxic"
"Perhaps these are the reasons that made me a bitter person. Put people of this generation together with the reality of daily life in Singapore: massively crowded trains, stagnant wages, highly competitive workplace, increase in cost of living, and then being shat on for being 'strawberries'. You are going to get a lot of disenchanted, disillusioned, bitter and perhaps even angry, people.Why you only get 99 points???!!!!"
"Why do you think the 5Cs are unattainable? Also, has it ever been sold as a Singapore dream or that most people should eventually achieve them? That doesn't make much sense from the get go. Cars/condos/country club memberships are all limited, and for good (IMO) reasons.My impression of the 5Cs is that they are used by some people as a proxy for affluence and distinguished success. It would only be so if most people don't have them, but that shouldn't deter young people for aspiring towards them, if they are so inclined.As for being the best in everything just to catch up, I'm sure you know that's hyperbole. By definition that can't be right."
"Singaporean life is stressful. You have hot weather, crowd, competitive people and foreign talents, army reservist, competitive job market, choking transportation system, high house and car price. I used to complain a lot with everybody. I blamed the school, gov, blah blah. But in my heart, I know only I can save myself; take action!3 years ago, I moved to New Zealand. made a lot of sacrifices, went through a lot of ups and downs, hit a lot of roadblocks (I even did housekeeping in NZ with a NTU first class honours degree to survive). My journey migrating to NZ can be written into a book with 20 chapters of the challenges I face.Now my life is starting to improve with a skilled job and work life balance. Even with modest income, I am quite proud of myself."
This is a book I’d like to read!
"Congrats, you made it out alive from this shit city. Many people didnt..."
"I want to move to New Zealand too, do you mind giving me some pointers? How do I get started?"
How's life in general now? Pretty sure everyone reading this would be interested.
"in general NZ really has work life balance with slightly low pay. But Im happy overall. The things i mentioned above will drive me crazy and make me a slave. A lot less crowded, lots of nature to clear up mind, things are slower, bosses encourage work life balance (they do not like you to work OT), bosses are like friends (same level as you), cars are cheap so can afford and get anywhere fast (no need squeeze in MRT/bus for hours), 4 seasons climate is great!, less asian people, more international people, 20 days annual leave, 5 days paid sick leave, free healthcare, less focus on GPA & grades, more focus on real world result etc.Not so good are heavier income tax, expensive food, expensive electronics, sometimes too quiet, far away from other tourist destinations"
"I reserve judgement on Singaporeans until I have chatted with 3 million of them (a better sample size)After living overseas for years, I saw fair share of “angry” people in different countries including Singapore. On the other hand, I also met the nicest even-tempered people too - even in Singapore.The cool citizens (both young and mature) are the quiet ones that do not pop up in social media or newspapers or even Stomp. They don’t seek limelight They are way too busy caring for their families, friends and colleagues to bother with the incidents on social mediaSo what we see in social media could well be minority. Truly believe most don’t misbehave"
"Agreed. In the UK I've seen angry xenophobic natives yelling at Slavs in the streets, on several occasions. Never seen that level of public anger in SG even once."
most people who complain about angry people online havent met angry people online with guns cough maga
"Those ""angry people online with guns"" tend to be less hateful than liberals who live on twitter, but maybe that's just me."
"Imo, at the moment the Western extreme liberals are more verbally hateful, and more destructive to people's school/work lives, but the extreme conservatives are more likely to commit violence IRL."
"Google antifa and I think your opinion will change pretty quickly. Violence is also harder to comment on because some conservatives don't attack people because of political ideologies, while those liberals are more likely to be motivated by politics."
"I am aware of the evils of Antifa, Bike Lock Man, etc. But AFAIK they rarely try to straight out murder people. Compare with far-right extremists who've shot up/bombed mosques and synagogues throughout Europe and America. Could be a case of less opportunity though, as alt-left extremists nowadays tend to be poorly-armed and ideologically anti-gun ownership."
😂
"Honestly it’s the weather and being too densely populated and also maybe the increasing cost of living. I don’t have kids and have a comfortable income. No car and not living in a condo but doing okay. And not to sound materialistic but compared to ten years ago when I was struggling financially, having a bit more money really makes things a hell lot easier. I don’t worry about paying bills, or the necessities in life and can treat myself on my wants.Most importantly of course my fixed costs such as housing hasn’t increased by much. But if you have kids and a family to support, it will be even challenging and if you buy a bigger property and add on an expensive car then your expenses will grow even larger. That can lead to stress and anxiety trying to cope with payments and of course the bitterness and resentment if you choose to go that way and if you’re the type of person who wants to keep up with the Lees, Kumars and Ahmads with the overseas trips and condominiums and an MPV. Or just looking at them with envy can cause you to get even more bitter that you don’t have what they have.Basically people should learn to be content with life and also live within their means and not have too many kids than they can afford. It baffles me when anyone has more than 2 these days. Like how can you afford? And other than money, there’s the added stress of raising kids especially if you are a working mum. But meh none of my business...The thing is, I feel that it’s all about people’s personal choices that sometimes lead them to be angry, bitter and resentful when things don’t work out well. As a user said above, some people are not well off but they take things to stride and even super rich people can be unhappy. Anyway this is just my own personal opinion. And I could be wrong."
"I have been noticing a quickly widening gap in opinion and perspectives between my mid-upper class acquaintances (usually above 250 PSLE scorers, parents able to afford extra music/sports classes, overseas uni educated) and my lower class acquaintances (ITE, sec 5 dropouts, lots of family problems).The inability of the first group to understand the struggles of the latter is astounding. I read through this thread before commenting, and I find that the popular opinions are usually echoed by the first group, while the “angry complainers” tend to fall in the second.Oftentimes, I would have liked to explain to my more well-to-do acquaintances the valid reasons and connections behind the usual gripes of the common man. Yet there are just some things that words cannot convey rather than an experience. The more successful a person is, the more he can’t seem to understand that life is not meritocratic, nor is it fair.If you want to know why people are angry, and you still don’t get it, maybe it’s because you’re too far up in the sky to understand what it’s like in hell.The fact is, there are many people in Singapore who feel like they have been driven into a corner. They are surviving yes, but not living. And all they can do is grumble. I’m not saying that’s a good thing, but it’s also not difficult to understand that when a person is helpless, the most he could do is to make noise and emote. That’s what babies do- because they lack the power to change their environment."
"That’s interesting.I was brought up in a lower-SES family and trips to McDonald’s depended on how many newspaper coupons we could accumulate.I’m mixed race so I enjoyed double the racism. I signed on in the army and worked serving drunken people. I don’t have a diploma and I now, for context, run a decent business.I don’t share the same resentment because I believe you can work for it. Use that energy to do good for yourself. Success is as good as you make it out to be.As a previous user shared, being forced in a corner cuts across all classes. Reality is in the eyes of the beholder."
"I think part of your success in life can certainly be credited to your go-getting mindset and drive. But this is exactly the kind of attitude (no negativity implied here) that I mean when I say that the more successful a person is, the less they seem to understand that life is neither meritocratic nor fair.See, in your experience, you managed to “rise above” your preset circumstances and you feel that since you have been successful in doing so, the same applies to everyone else. But you, like many others, forget that the same presets do not apply to everyone. For example, just based on what you have shared here, I’m guessing you did not have to deal with a debilitating mental illness, or abusive parents, or wayward peers from a young age- just to name a few. But there are other people who are faced with a myriad circumstances that land them in jail, in debt, in depression, in poverty. And just like your road to success, theirs was a road embarked on by their own two feet, sure, but certainly begun and guided along by uncontrollable forces.It is harder, I’m sure for a successful person to recognise this, because in a way it would invalidate their success to a major extent. It would make all hard working, striving people question many things.The point is, we should all aim for compassion, even if we cannot accomplish empathy."
I appreciate your answer and it does put me in a space for further consideration. Thank you.
"I will argue that even if the middle class can empathise with the lower SES, ultimately it’s a big bad world with lots of bad unfortunate shit going down all over. what anyone can really do is to focus on taking care of their immediate family as the first priority before extending any help to people outside of the circle of family."
"The issue with the line of argument is that it becomes a slippery slope towards""Anyone who is successful got their not because of their ability, but because society is unfair""Which then turns to""We must penalise successful people.""This equal outcomes rather than equal opportunity mentality discourages people from taking personal responsibility - and the people the penalise the most at the capable, hard working people who came from bad personal circumstances (e.g. someone who studied hard coming from low-income get lumped in the successful people category and become penalised for it).I myself came from a very low SES background (refugee, single parent, embroiled in legal battles when I was a kid). In childhood, we scoured coupons, and had difficulty find enough to eat, forget extra classes. Nevertheless, I found a passion, obtained a PhD and are now consider reasonably high SES.I have empathy for people from poor backgrounds sure, but at the same time I think it is important to recognise that a deviation in success in society is not a bad thing - enforced equity, or communism, does not lead to a healthy society."
"Same thoughtsTo the former, perhaps it's (sometimes) not the the inability to understand but the refusal to (Concept of Amathia). People live in their reality through their experiences. And these experiences shape a person's truth from the moment they are able to ponder.People are adamant to change their beliefs unless they have experienced (through either personal senses or an extremely credible account) it themselves. As you say they may be too far up in the sky to know what it's like in hellInformation is the key thing that the latter is lacking, in addition to the mental ability to process hindered by the poor conditions and worries"
I like what you said. We are surviving here not really living life here.
"I work overseas for many years now, recently I came back to Singapore (about 1 month plus already) and I observe that Singaporeans have become more angry, more bitter and more toxic.Perhaps Singaporeans have always been that way and I did not see it during in my youth.The other thing I observed is, I am more unhappier in Singapore. I dont know if its the air or the food but something in Singapore just brings out the worse in me. I feel like my fuse is a bit short.I think it has to do with the people. There is simply too many people in a small place. In animal husbandry, we learn about the concept of 'stocking density' where by the x amount of animal per given hectare is finite. Once you exceed the amount, diseases, aggression, stress, ill thrift and sudden deaths will go up."
"Having stayed in a few countries for long periods be it work, study or holiday, Singapore is extremely crowded. In city areas and shops can barely take 10 steps without bumping into someone. HK and big city Japan is worse but cooler climate makes it better at least for me. Having stayed in semi-rural places before, I like the quietness but I do miss the convenience of Singapore haha."
This. Singapore feels so people-dense. And yet I wonder why the Government here seeks to fit more people into the country.
More people more $$$.
I had a returning friend describe the same as a thumb down his neck feeling
"I’m now holidaying in Finland, thinking about going back to sg makes me angry, too angry to write more! Btw there are tonnes of angry sinkies in the edmw forum.."

"Good for holidays but I’m not sure about staying here, the cost of living is so high. Nonetheless I’m having a good time here, I love the culture, the weather and the Finns are really nice and friendly people. The only thing I miss about sg is chinese food haha.."
"People are discontented and bored, especially when their basic needs (not wants) are already met and life is just mundane. It's so easy to get swept up in a moment or a trend on social media because publicly typing into the cyber void about these is a placebo for validation that (the proverbial) you matter, that your opinions matter, and that you are actually contributing to a cause without much effort. And when everyone is singing the same angry tune, there is a feel-good effect to aligning yourself with the moral ""right"" and majority. It's just convenient to blame everything that goes wrong on society, the government, luck, anything external or outside our control.I think it also takes too much effort to consider the other side, so it's safer and easier to criticize than to critically think about an issue or challenge it. If you don't really feel invested but yet want to participate in a trending discourse, it is just easier to parrot soundbites and skim the surface of an issue than to dissect it. Plus, attention span is now shorter and issues blow over quick because there is always a new thing that will crop up and seize public attention's attention even before the previous issue has been properly ventilated. So we see bursts of anger and emotions that spark as quickly as they die down.Plus it's too dang humid in Singapore, so it is just physically uncomfortable here with too many people in your face all the time.What can we do? I think we can try to be more aware of what we are thinking, and why we think the way we do. If we are a little more introspective, maybe we would be less angry. We could also try to be a bit more charitable to others. Not charity, charitable. Be a little kinder in our own lives. Can't make someone else do that, but we can at least start with ourselves and maybe that may change something."
"I think it also takes too much effort to consider the other side, so it's safer and easier to criticize than to critically think about an issue or challenge it.I would be angry too if I was stuck in a place where I am an unhappy. Not just an SG phenomenon."
"I just blame the weather hahaha.. it's so humid, sticky, uncomfortable and it's just gotten hotter. If we had cooler air in the mornings and late afternoons maybe we'll all be more chill too. We'd take more walks outside. The long wait for buses and trains wouldn't be as bad, the congestion would be more bearable I think. But you know ... this pressure cooker of a country."
"There are two things I’d like share from your observation.One, a local friend of mine who lived in a seasonal climate for a number of years argued that there’s nothing to look forward to in Singapore. It’s either wet or hot and you are perpetually in that state.Two, this is one of many times I heard the term “pressure cooker”. I do feel stressed growing my business but that comes with the territory. However, I’ve never felt this societal pressure. I was brought up in a lower-SES family and the parents never forced us to chase the paper or compared us to anyone. Is it an upbringing thing?"
WHO SAYS I'M ANGRY???!!!
Nabe!! Whoo!!
"I think Singaporean culture and society in general does not place much emphasis on practicing gratitude - we’re always thinking of more, more, more.Given a particular situation the first instinct is to find things about it that does NOT satisfy us, rather than be grateful and appreciate what went well or how much worse it could be."
"Too many people packed into a tiny space resulting in competition for everything and long queues everywhere. Fast pace of life and stress to grow Grow GROW economy every year. Quality of services seems to be going in the wrong direction, but taxes and prices always going up Up UP. Being micromanaged by the nanny state from smoking e-cigs to pumping petrol in johore to your own retirement savings. Whenever something goes wrong the answer is always ""no choice, suck thumb"". Meanwhile the highest paid politicians drone on about ""ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country"".Can you blame em?"
Its not only Singapore. Any cities with dense population and uncultured people will definately create so much anger and frustrations. You know that cliche of New Yorkers being always angry?Its actually not a cliche its how it is.
"Happiness is not a function of external factors, it never is and it never will be. It’s easier to blame external factors like money, surrounding, parents, society, government, etc but extremely difficult to take responsibility of the situations and circumstances yourself.All human faculties are designed to look outwards which gives us an illusion that the causes and effects must be somewhere outside. Ever wondered why we can’t hear the loud noise of the heart thumping in our chest or the blood gushing through our nerve streams or the millions of cells degenerating and regenerating every second?Victor Frankl from Man’s search for meaning“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way”"

"Behavioral sinkThe ethologist John B. Calhoun coined the term ""behavioral sink"" to describe the collapse in behavior which resulted from overcrowding. Over a number of years, Calhoun conducted over-population experiments on Norway rats (in 1958–1962) and mice (in 1968–1972).Calhoun coined the term ""behavioral sink"" in his February 1, 1962 report in an article titled Population Density and Social Pathology in Scientific American on the rat experiment.Calhoun's work became used as an animal model of societal collapse, and his study has become a touchstone of urban sociology and psychology in general.In the 1962 study, Calhoun described the behavior as follows:Many [female rats] were unable to carry pregnancy to full term or to survive delivery of their litters if they did.[ ^PM | Exclude ^me | Exclude from ^subreddit | FAQ / ^Information | ^Source ] Downvote to remove | v0.28"
I always thought SG was bad until I visited Hong Kong.
"I was in HK for a good 3 days and a Singaporean friend of mine (that went with me) lived there many years ago. He asked me if I would live here. It was my second day and I immediately said no because it’s perpetually busy. If I was to move, it must be a place that allows me to be a better version of myself. But hey, the grass is always greener where you water it the most."
"I feel the problem is, you never know if a place allows an individual to be a better version of themselves, until they have already lived in it."
"True. That’s why grass greener where you water it lah. I got uncles drinking every other week under my block, taking a piss at each other and occasionally pissing in the bushes. It’s like they’ve reached their ultimate form. Hahaha."
"that's true, worked there for 3 months and quickly did a u-turn."
"That’s very interesting. You might heard of it, your observation points to the rat experiment on overcrowding . I’m interested in understanding the source of this anger and this is as close as it gets. However, I’m not angry though living in the same space."
"I find Singaporeans, mostly the Chinese, to be cranky to an extent, even if they don't mean it or aren't being outright salty.I like to complain as well, but most of it is done in a jokingly manner or half-hartedly. I only find myself seriously complaining on occasion, but I don't act like I'm made out of salt.The question is: Are those angry people throwing salt because they really are mad at the Government and what not, or are they mad at themselves or their situation and are taking out on something? Are they the type to be happy once all their problems are solved, or will they continue to make noise?One thing I can tell you for sure is that being a salty keyboard warrior ain't gonna change anything. If we want change, we need to find the courage to take action as a people."
"kids here are trained to compete and steal each others lunches so not sure why the surprise when people go at it with one another, its completely different from the ft crowd and it puts people here at a disadvantage"
"I don't know about the experience of others', but in my primary and secondary school experience, I always felt that we were forced to compete with one another for our grades.Sure, we had some friendly competition here and there, but none of us felt like we had to bring someone down to boost ourselves up. If something were to put us in that situation, it is the system."
They always existed. Its just that the power of social media has given you a direct channel to their ranting.In the past the crazies kept their mouth shut but now they think they have an audience.Sometimes these people are also manipulated/triggered by russian bots posting comments
"This is why the country never improves. When people rant or share their woes, the rest call them crazies and Russian bots. Where have I seen this technique before? Hmmm"
"You can’t do anything.I’ve met these people. They fall mainly into 2 groups.People whose parents have been spouting angry responses to ‘The man’ for anything and everything.It’s going to take a lot of deprogramming to convince them to think critically regarding issues that have opinions drilled into their minds since day one.2) People who have been personally shafted by policy changes or inadequate public services.I have this lawyer friend whose entire business got rendered obsolete by the government. I think he lost about a few hundred K due to the change, and that put him out of business.I don’t know specifically what he did, but people don’t recover from this kind of trauma without harbouring hatred for those they perceived that have wronged them."
"Your observation of the first group is interesting. My parents (about 60-70yo) are big fans of the ruling party. But I turned out questioning everything.There are stupidity everywhere from politicians and to the people. But there are also astute and critical thinking from the man and from the people. I think to me, it just points to who is loudest.As for your second observation, I get it and I hear you. Anyone—the man, the common man or any man—take away what you worked hard for is where the sword of vengeance will fall."
"It's important to remember that the kind of people in group 2 end up raising kids that fall under group 1.Yep, nothing you can do about the ""you killed my pappy, I'm calling you out, lawman"" folks. (pun not intended, it's a legit quote)"
"I have this hypothesis on why Singaporeans are so angry: we don’t have a common, non-Singaporean, virtual enemy. And I argue that when we left the Malaysia Cup the communal spirit died with it.When was the last time you’ll see 55,000 Singaporeans shouting at one thing? The referee, the boys in yellow and representing us in the trenches were people we cared about—the Fandis, Tong Hais and Sundrams of our time.It was cathartic. Now our catharsis seems to come from the MRT."
True. The gahmen doesnt help when they keep destroying our heritage buildings. No common identity anymore.
"your first sentence contradicts with your last? anyway, enemy is such a strong word to use, you want us to riot in the streets and burn Japanese cars like our fellow east Asians whenever they get riled up by their politicians?"
How does it contradict? And to go from football to rioting in the streets sounds like such a far fetched reality. Where is this coming from?
"For me, its road hogs. Road hogs makes me really angry. Especially the ""I'm gonna drive on lane one and match the speed on lane 2 so we can drive side by side"" hogs."
"a portion were brought up in such a way they have to live to parents' / society etc expectations.as though it is a complete guidebook to success..portions really did live to those expectations though at times struggling .. instead of doing what they have passion for.however when working/adult life begins then they realise perhaps this isn't what i wanted - unhappy. but still continue doing it becos i need my ricebowl right..hence all of these unhappiness is being spreaded to everything else... (not forgetting they continue to follow such guide for their next generation) including all sorts of negative attitudes and behaviours ..whereas, portions may have realised that that guide did not really work, though person is indeed having very good ricebowl or maybe not etc but is more knowledgeable to come terms with finding happiness for self etc and hence these are the just living everyday happily /not the grouchy ones that actually take effort to find fault in everything, be unhappy, make others unhappy too🤷🏻‍♀️"

Sure. I hope to answer all of them.
"A wise man (Buddha) once said, the cause of all suffering is desire. People get angry because they want more, or because they feel they deserve more, which they ain’t getting. In this fast-paced rat race, it is perhaps easy to feel upset all the time."
"Climate It’s hot. The weather alone makes me feel frustrated.Lack of Freedom When I go to work in the morning, I’m crushed by the crowd and yes, I could have bought a car. But it’s so ridiculously expensive. For me, a car provides a sense of freedom like none and yet after studying and working hard you feel like you’re being denied of it.Stress of work You work hard and are told to aspire to higher standards and held accountable for any cock ups. But you find that it’s not the same set of accountability everywhere. People in high places seemed to be able to explain things away.You’re constantly told to achieve insurmountable standards cos we are Singapore and a first one country. When we do the same, for example, MRT and standard of living, we are told to compare singapore to 3rd world countries. It’s a moving goalpost basically.Lack of Financial Security You work hard for a pittance and yet you have to worry about having enough to retire or whether you need to downgrade to a pigeon hole of a studio apartment.Lack of Medical Security You worry whether you can afford to stay in a decent ward when you are hospitalized. Not only that, you pay through your nose for a b ward and realize that it’s not even air-conditioned! It’s not a luxury when you’re sick. Try going to a government hospital ward at 12 noon.There are many more and I’m lazy to continue on. In short, the life of a Singaporean, at least for me, is plagued by worries and the feeling that I’m not well-taken care of by the state. I mean we pay top dollars for them and yet every policy is evaluated by dollars and sense only instead of my welfare. What is the Singapore dream? There ain’t one for me.My only regret is I should have studied harder and left. Yes, there may be racism but at least my basic needs and some wants are taken care of. Those who can’t leave or are left behind like me get angrier cos we can only look at those overseas with envy. What’s left for us to look forward to? Retirement? WTH.I have relatives overseas and yes they may not be at the top of their career ladder due to their race but they get 28 days of annual leave, a small Japanese car, a landed property, nice weather, no conscription and finish work at 6.My family’s all I got, but I hate my father. I hate life here and yes when I come back from holidays I can feel the anger seeping in from my heart as well."
Have you thought about talking to anyone? The pent up anger is going to eat you alive. What's an outlet that helps?
"Forget it. What’s gonna help? They will just say forget it, suck it up and that’s life in Singapore. Or... have you thought about how the people in 3rd world countries live?"
"Forget about ""them"". Think for yourself for a change. You have the power to make a change in your reality. What can you do to make one thing better for yourself tomorrow? Don't have to answer here, but consider it."
"After a long day of work, I like to relax and chill with a glass of wine or beer. After a sip, you realize that even during that 5 seconds you’re still at the mercy of the overreaching state.A can of beer costs $3??? Yes, fags are bad for health but beer? I’m robbed of the ability to even indulge myself affordably!Fine fine. I’ll live like a monk. I go outside for a run to de-stress. Barely five minutes into the run, I’m sweating like a dog and not even nice scenery to make up for it. I’m still stuck in between endless blocks of flats!"
"Looking at it from another angle, there is also a chance that those who are angry are not even Sgreans in the first place.It's so so SO easy to create an account (or a couple) claiming u are whoever you are on social media and start the ball rolling.Peeps like these range from individuals who are boliao and just want to troll, or those who are brainwashed / jealous / hate our country so much they go to the extent of reading our news and finding opportunities to bash us / spread negativities while masquerading as sgreans.I'm not so concerned about those, they are amusing and usually not so coherent to cause much impact.What I'm worried about are people with a deeper agenda; those who do this for a living and am extremely good at it.Think about it, it's not really rocket science to assimilate yourself into a country and its culture online aside from alot of time needed to build up the credibilities.Gather 10 of these people, each simultaneously cultivating 50-100 of these fake accounts, and you have a sizable group of 'locals' waiting to carry out whatever agenda the highest bidder can concoct... and you don't spend money hiring professionals / mass accounts just for the simple act of 'for the lulz'.Destablizing a country has many benefits for outsiders and powerful individuals, many case studies online for your references. Portray something in a bad light consistently, best with 'alot of people' agreeing with you, and your opinion will become absolute and the rest of the innocent sheep will automatically join in the furore. (Reddit's karma system explains this lemmings mentality very well.)"

"You sound like a cool guy. Some will straight up tell you that you're happy because you're not married and don't have kids.Anyway, re: complaining, I think it's because Singaporeans have high expectations. Anyone who is into politics will know that most of the world is a shitshow and Singapore is actually relatively alright, but most Singaporeans will tell you that isn't enough, and that we have problems too, and we should continue to make things better.Because we don't really vote for another party at the ballot box, and because we don't have labor movements that allow for demonstrations and strikes, our way of doing things have become complaining."
"I will argue that one reason we consistently expect more of the government is that the government consistently expects more of us; we are constantly barraged by expectations to be dutiful NS men happily sacrifices 2 years and more of their life to country, to be filial sons who will take care of the elders due to the lack of social security, to extend “many helping hands” to the less fortunate because they are none, to make do with a smaller space in procreation, to be happy about our public transportation, to be the eye on ground with the sgsecure, to be a good worker who will work into their seventies because we wanted to be active, to be silent when leadership fail, to be content with our lot in life when there exist a crazy rich side of Singapore and trust that benefits will trickle down, to be accommodating to immigrants regardless if they are benign or not."
"To be frank, me being in my late 30s, I’m inspired by the young. And I agree with you, I do admire their ideals.I’m researching on Generation Z, those born in the mid-90s to mid-2000s, because they distrust traditional media, social media are for old people and information is only as strong as their circle.But that seems to be leading to another problem all together—a different version of misinformation—unlike your Aunty/Uncle WhatsApp groups or alt-news websites."
What alternatives to social media are the Gen Z using?

"It's just human nature and not something unique to Singaporeans. We could be living in paradise and we'd still find something to complain about. Hell, a dude who's travelled around the world offered his opinion that we live in the best country in the world and we still found a way to get pissed about it.You won't be able to do anything about it. There are always gonna be people on the extremes who will find fault with everything. You won't learn anything from listening to them. Just tune out the noise and pay attention to the more ""reasonable"" criticisms because those have value."
"[Long post ahead] I was at a local wedding and sat with a friend (born and bred Singaporean, let’s call him X) and a German lady (worked in Singapore for more than a decade and married a Singaporean man). X suddenly complains about the MRT.German lady had a confused look. I asked what’s on her mind and she sang praises about the MRT as compared to the London Underground and the New York subway (she worked in both cities) where the delays could run for hours.There’s this amazing podcast called Invisibilia from NPR. One of the episodes is called “Frame of Reference”. In a nutshell, what I learned was we are as good as what we know. If all you know is the MRT, a minute delay is a minute too long. If you’ve got stuck in the underground or subway for hours, that’s your frame of reference.Could this be a factor? In my opinion, it points to masses lack of pain."
"Well my opinion is that if you're going to artificially inflate the cost of personal motor transport and force the majority of your population to take public transport, you better damn well build and maintain a good transport system.In those countries with crappy public transport, people do have the option of buying a cheap car or motorbike to get around."
"Ummmm.....have you been to New York or London? Buying a car is cheap, yes, but parking and driving into the city is just waaaaayyyyy to expensive!"
"I experienced a similar example myself. I had just returned from a holiday in Germany, and I was telling a German schoolmate that it was great, with the infrastructure well-developed, with the trains punctual and inexpensive. She replied, ""really? The trains in Germany are shit, they're late all the time these days. Used to be better in the 90s."""
"That's fairly accurate imo - having a broader perspective (e.g. by living abroad) would maybe help. But ultimately, it's because it's in our nature to be critical."
"We have every right to be critical, but we also have every right to not have an opinion.My wife (born and bred Singaporean, local girls school and studied university overseas) pointed to our education system. It’s not only about being right but it’s also about being first.I left secondary school to sign on to a military unit that gave you whatever you wanted (thereabouts) as long as you do your job. I’m not sure if I absolved myself of the 5Cs (remember that campaign?) or just don’t care for national ambitions."

Why is an army regular trying to lecture us about being angry?
"My army regular life was a 4-year contract, though. I left the army when I was about 25? Hated reservist and especially RT but decided to make the full use of the former and skipped the latter because of a slip disc.Why do you think this is a lecture? Have you been lectured most of the time and see this as a trigger? Asking because I’m in the space of learning and understanding."

If you think it’s normal or necessary to provide such context to start conversations then can’t really argue as we differ in ideology.FYI, nobody need anyone to portrait themselves average through checklist to start a conversation.Also, the burner comment was a joke due to his overemphasized on being average (something a person trying to disguise by overly being average).

"Haha yeah the burner comment not to be taken with serious accusations tone. My bad, should’ve added /s tag earlier. It was a joke on your overly emphasize on average checklist (as if someone trying to be in disguise).No trouble, just overblown on a silly comment. It wasn’t meant to be serious trial by fire thing haha"
I hear you and no worries. Do consider that words hold power no matter how much anyone consider otherwise. It all adds up to the cause and effect of where we are today.
Unless you’re rich and white in America like trump. Being overly politically correct is a problem too. Maybe it’s more applicable in conservative SG as people are more sensitive.
whats the problem? critical thinking is good and you seem to be the person who got triggered
"Sharing on social media can help grieving hearts heal, say expertsSINGAPORE — After losing his younger brother to cancer last year, psychiatrist Adrian Wang found some solace on social media.“What helped me (through the grieving process) was people leaving messages on my private Facebook account to say something nice about my brother. It helped a lot to know what he meant to them,” said Dr Wang, a consultant psychiatrist at Gleneagles Medical Centre.Once a private affair, mourning those who have died has taken a new dimension with social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Dayre.Last month, the death of actor Aloysius Pang, who succumbed to injuries from a military training exercise, sparked an outpouring of grief online. His girlfriend, actress Jayley Woo, posted over 70 Instagram Stories overnight sharing pictures, videos and words, and continues to express online her sadness and longing for him. Others close to Pang did the same.While some argue that going public makes it harder to move on or may even trivialise a death, experts said it can be a healthy way for those left behind to process grief.While different people mourn and grieve differently, it is always better to express one’s feelings in some way, either verbally or online, said Dr Wang.“A lot of people use social media to regulate their emotions. When they are angry, they may tweet something. Even (United States President) Donald Trump does that,” he said.Ms Vyda S Chai, a clinical psychologist at Think Kids and Think Psychological Services, said social media provides “the here-and-now moment” to express one’s feelings and breaks down barriers of silence.In Asian cultures where people tend to be more stoic, an online platform provides an avenue for the grieving party to process and clarify their feelings and sorrows, said Dr Wang. This can be in the form of a blog post, online memorandum or even engaging in a group discussion.However, trolls are among the downsides to sharing your grief online.“With verbal grieving, you can choose who you want to speak to in the room. Online, you make yourself vulnerable to a lot of keyboard warriors, people who pass unhelpful comments, criticise or even blame you, especially when your post is public. Even private posts can be screenshot and made public,” said Dr Wang.For those sharing their grief online, know that “there will be haters who hate”, Dr Wang said.“Deal with them the same way you deal with trolls – ignore them. Personally, I would limit grieving on social media to a private account because of the danger of trolling,” he said.TYPICALLY 6 TO 12 MONTHS TO REACH ACCEPTANCEGrief is a necessary, natural and healthy response to a personally painful or traumatic event, said Ms Chai.As a person comes to terms with a loss, a series of emotions sets in. Based on Swiss-American psychiatrist Elisabeth Kubler-Ross’ model for grief, there are five stages but not everyone goes through the same process.“We may experience a myriad of emotions, from shock or anger to disbelief, guilt and profound sadness. The pain of grief can affect physical well-being, making it difficult to sleep, eat, and one can be (too) overwhelmed with memories to think straight,” said Ms Chai.But these emotions, she added, are normal reactions to significant loss.“In order for a wound to heal, we must feel the pain,” said Ms Chai.There is no telling how long the grief process may last, but most people typically take around six to 12 months to reach acceptance, said Dr Wang.Most people gradually arrive at a “new normal”, said Ms Chai.“It does not mean you’ve forgotten the person, but you no longer feel the intense pain. Instead of feeling sad all the time, you are able to reinvest your emotional energy to other things like enjoy your friendships, work and usual activities,” said Dr Wang.Another sign to show that the person is gradually healing is that sadness is no longer of the same intensity.“You will still feel sadness. Perhaps a familiar song may bring tears to your eyes. But you can also remember the good parts, the joy and meaning the person brought to your life,” said Dr Wang.WHEN TO SEEK HELPGrief that lingers for more than 12 months is considered “prolonged grief”, said Dr Wang.People who had a close, intense relationship with the deceased, or feel guilty or responsible towards the person’s death, have a higher risk of experiencing this debilitating form of grief, he said.Certain types of relationships, such as a parent who loses his or her child, may be more prone to prolonged grief.Prolonged grief can affect the way a person functions. For instance, he or she may not be able to go to work, and may become isolated, said Ms Chai.Behaviour like isolation, self-blame, lack of sleep and poor appetite that lasts more than four to six months without improvements may lead to complicated grief and depression, she added.Individuals should seek professional help if the symptoms are very intense and/or if they have suicidal or homicidal thoughts, said Dr Wang.DON’T DOWNPLAY OTHERS’ GRIEFWhen supporting family or friends who are grieving, people should mindful of what they say and not be quick to offer advice – it is not helpful to minimise grief by telling the person to “move on”, “put this behind” or “time heals all wounds”, said the experts.“Allow your loved one to gradually move through the process. Nothing can replace their loss. (Saying) less is actually better; emphathise instead of judge. It is okay to tell them you are sorry about their loss but sometimes, being quietly present and available is paramount,” said Ms Chai.One way to lend support is to offer a listening ear and extend help in practical ways.“For example, asking gently if they need anything (such as meals or the running of errands) can go a long way. Visit them often and ask if they would like to meet up with close family and friends for meals,” said Ms Chai.Offering kind words of encouragement, even if the griever does not respond to messages, helps too, said Dr Wang.Encouraging participation in bereavement rituals such as prayers, and doing things to remember to deceased, aid the grief process, he added.For Dr Wang, honouring and practising the good values that his late brother held dear have helped with the healing.“My brother was a principled person who always stuck to his guns and was uncompromising in his values. I try to remember him by doing things that he would have done,” he said.0.4.0-beta | Source code | Contribute"

"Is it really the same city though? Many on the list have been destroyed and/or abandoned, with the population reduced to village-level for prolonged periods, before being resettled and rebuilt by a completely different polity and culture. Singapore is one of them.The originally Srivijayan city of Temasek was at some point sacked and vassalised by Majapahit and possibly Ayutthaya, then resettled by Malacca, and then it was razed to the ground by the Portuguese, reduced to village-level settlements for centuries, then finally colonised by Raffles. I'd say that Singapore isn't the city of Temasek. I'd say that Temasek and Singapore are different cities, both located on the same island but separated by time."
"Is it really the same city though?This is a difficult question to answer, unless there is some sort of characteristic designated to be definitive of a city which we can all agree on.For instance, is the Singapore which was colonised by Raffles the same city of Singapore we have now, after it has been conquered by the Japanese, liberated from the Japanese, then colonised again, then merged with Malaysia, then kenna kicked out and became independent?I wonder if there is some useful method in defining whether a city is still the same city even after having undergone many changes. What of the city remains unchanged amidst the changes?"
Cities like Rome till have the same main roads that existed thousands of years ago.
"Thanks for your reply. Yup, certain city infrastructure like roads remain relatively unchanged even after a long time.Just wondering, would you say roads/streets are a key identifier of cities?"
"Definitely. Buildings change. Roads usually don't. We don't delete roads unless necessary. And in the city centre, some of our roads have been present at least since 1895. Even if you visit a city some 10-20 years later, maybe all the buildings have changed, but the road remains familiar."
"Even if you visit a city some 10-20 years later, maybe all the buildings have changed, but the road remains familiar.Mmm... that's an interesting perspective, especially your mention of the word 'familiar'. This is a really good word I've been looking for, thanks!"
sounds like the ship of theseus problemin which case the answer is: its the same city in continuity (at least from Raffles' landing) but not in material.
"Yup yup, it's quite like the ship of theseus problem. But I am guessing at the moment, that with cities, certain factors/characteristics weigh heavier in identifying the city. So hope you don't mind if I ask you some further questions.its the same city in continuity (at least from Raffles' landing) but not in materialWhat would you consider to be continuous in the 'same' city?"
"hmm, tough. i'll be honest and say im echoing the summary of an article regarding the ship of theseus problem and human life (which i read a long time ago, so unfortunately i dont have a link)"
"Thanks for the honesty, appreciate it. :)I don't think this is a problem that has definite 'solution'. It's more about the psychology of identity and identification. And the more we look into it, the more puzzling it appears to be. Because, what the heck is a city?So I guess whether a city is same or different depends on what the person identify the city to be."
"Though for your WW2 example, it was mostly the same people in the same place in the same streets and buildings, despite different rulers and different city names. For the Kingdom of Singapura to Singapore is almost completely wasn't."
"I see. Thanks for this.So would you consider the Singapore colonised by Raffles in 1819 to be different from the city we have now in 2019, because the streets and buildings are almost completely different, but the place is the same and the people roughly the same?Which of these factors weigh more to you?Hope I'm not being rude asking all these, but I am curious about how other people identify and perceive identity."
"You're welcome! I'd say that the key factor is continuity. Every city and every man for that matter is a ship of Theseus. But in the case of old Temasek, someone sunk the ship entirely, then constructed a new ship from new people in the same location."
"You're welcome!Thanks!I'd say that the key factor is continuity.It's probably going to be challenging, but could you break down what you mean by 'continuity' in relation to city, with maybe Singapore as an example?You mentioned location, which remains the same, so I think we can consider that as some sort of continuity. You also mentioned new people, which I think you take it as a break in continuity. Could you explain a little more about this point of 'new' people?Are there other factors you find important in the continuing identification of a city as the same city?"
"You also mentioned new people, which I think you take it as a break in continuity. Could you explain a little more about this point of 'new' people?If people are replaced bit by bit, I'd say it's the same city. If the entire area is depopulated and then repopulated centuries later, I'd say it's not.Like if a guy named Bob lives in a house for years, it's still Bob even if every atom in his body has been gradually replaced. If Bob dies and then another guy named Bob moves into the house 200 years later, it's not the ""same Bob continuously inhabiting the house for centuries"", even if the location and name are the same.Nope, that's about it I'd say. So to me, Lundenburg and London are the same city, but Londinium is not."
"Thanks for the examples of Bob and Lundenburh-London-Londinium. I think I understand what you are saying - that a sudden drastic break in continuity of the constituents, like population for example, is an important factor in the identification of a city as same or different."
"Yup, and you're welcome!"
"One big factor would be whether the city changed organically versus if it ceased to be a city for a period of time, and a new one was created from scratch again?"
"Thanks for your reply.whether the city changed organically versus if it ceased to be a city for a period of timeIf you don’t mind, could you elaborate more on what you mean by ‘changed organically’ and ‘ceased to be a city’?What would you also say a city is?"
"Disclaimer: I am just making this up on the spot, and am not learned in these things.Probably what a ""city"" is itself a function of time: What could be considered a city 1000 years back will perhaps be called a small town in 21st century. Having said that, the main idea of city typically will involve the absolute (as well as relative, in that time period) population/density of population, and more urban (rather than predominantly agriculture) oriented economy.I just found https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_hierarchy which gives some more info on what I am trying to say.`changed organically'would mean a gradual change in the buildings, population, economy; rather than all of that ceasing to exist, such that the location can't be defined as a city as per whatever the definition be for an extended period of time, before again fitting the definition of being a city.What this definition should be is somewhat hard for me to put in formally, but the first half of this comment and the accompanying wiki article provides some guideline."

"Settlement hierarchyA settlement hierarchy is a way of arranging settlements into a hierarchy based upon their population or some other criteria. The term is used by landscape historians and in the National Curriculum for England. The term is also used in the planning system for the UK and for some other countries such as Ireland, India and Switzerland. The term was used without comment by the geographer Brian Roberts in 1972.A settlement's population size, its geographic area, its status and the availability of services can all affect this hierarchy.[ ^PM | Exclude ^me | Exclude from ^subreddit | FAQ / ^Information | ^Source ] Downvote to remove | v0.28"

Let’s say a teleporter machine has been invented, and Mr Chin was the first human to have been teleported from Changi to Jurong. In being teleported, there was a very short instant when Mr Chin ceased to exist in Changi, and a split second later, re-existed in Jurong. Is this new Mr Chin still Mr Chin?"

Is this new Mr Chin still Mr Chin?If the ""new"" Mr Chin has the memory/personality/etc which are the same, and has an identical body, probably we will just not notice anything to be different :) So I will be tempted to say, ""yes"".Of-course, I can come up with a counter for my own yes, with a more intriguing hypothetical: if we could synthetically grow/3D print a new biologically identical Mr. Chin, and also transfer the same memory/personality (something like Altered Carbon), is this still Mr. Chin? because, like that, probably we can create multiple of them to exist in the same space-time ... which is rather awkward.edit: p.s. For cities, sometimes they get sacked in a war, etc. but get rebuilt within a ""short period"", in which case, even if it ends up being structurally even different, we probably still call it the same city. This is perhaps analogus to Mr. Chin having an accident :("
"If the ""new"" Mr Chin has the memory/personality/etc which are the same, and has an identical body, probably we will just not notice anything to be different :) So I will be tempted to say, ""yes"".Yeah, I would too. So I’m guessing that ‘familiarity’ is also an important factor in how we identify if something is same or different.Of-course, I can come up with a counter for my own yes, with a more intriguing hypothetical: if we could synthetically grow/3D print a new biologically identical Mr. Chin, and also transfer the same memory/personality (something like Altered Carbon), is this still Mr. Chin? because, like that, probably we can create multiple of them to exist in the same space-time ... which is rather awkward.That’s a good question! Are these Mr Chin same or different? I think for most people, they would make the effort to differentiate the original from the clones.For cities, sometimes they get sacked in a war, etc. but get rebuilt within a ""short period"", in which case, even if it ends up being structurally even different, we probably still call it the same city.Yup yup, there are several factors at play in how we identify a city as same. ‘Gradual change’ is one. A related factor would be ‘familiarity’. Maybe ‘sourceness’ as in an idea of original essence might be at work too."
"As someone from the Philippines for both Manila and Butuan, there is absolutely nothing remains of the original city anymore (except for a few minor digs and whatnot's that you can find in museums).The oldest visible part of Manila is roughly 500 years old (Intramuros - a walled city built during the Spanish colonization period). No usable part remains from the thousand year old original city."

The work which was composed sometime between 15th and 16th centuries, is considered one of the finest literary and historical works in the Malay language.The original text has undergone numerous changes, with the oldest known version dated May 1612, through the rewriting effort commissioned by the then regent of Johor, Yang di-Pertuan Di Hilir Raja Abdullah. It was originally written in the Classical Malay on traditional paper in old Jawi script, but today exists in 32 different manuscripts, including those in Rumi script.

No Kedah? Archaeological evidence found in Bujang Valley reveals that a Hindu–Buddhist kingdom ruled ancient Kedah possibly as early as 110 A.D. That is pretty much way older than any cities on this list.
"Because the list is not accurate if we're talking about surviving oldest city with actual structures surviving from that era, most of it aside from Hanoi were razed to the ground with broken debris in unpopulated jungle or buried under the Earth where the kingdom belonged. Jakarta's oldest building is a colonial era Portuguese church. Indonesia is quite notorious for destroying heritage sites, you can read about Kota Tua Jakarta. I mean if it matters, during the building of Circle Line they accidentally dug into a cemetery that got buried under the Earth and accidentally knock onto a Borneo Prince's grave, can't find the article anymore though"

Do you know that your language is influenced by Sanskrit? Do you know that Indonesia's Motto is Unity in Diversity but looks like you guys are not.
"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, the national motto which meant ""Diverse yet One"" it commonly translated as ""Unity in Diversity"", was a sentence that picked from ""Kakawin Sutasoma"" that is written by Mpu Tantular, a Majapahit official during the reign of Hayam Wuruk (the same king that ordered the sacking of the Kingdom of Singapura). The language in the kakawin (poetry) is in Old Javanese or ""Kawi"", a heavily sanskrit influenced language. Indonesian generally knows this fact.Our motto reflect the foundation of our national identity, that Indonesia is not build for the benefit particular ethnic, religious or racial identity. Furthermore, the basis of Indonesian National Identity was summed up in the Youth Pledge of 1928, in short it was Satu Tanah Air (One Motherland), Satu Bangsa (One Nation), Satu Bahasa (One Language).Our effort in uniting the country might not be 100% perfect, As the task of uniting 260 million people with (hundreds of) tribal, religious, and racial differences is no joke. But yet, we succeed in our goal of one language (Bahasa Indonesia), as virtually all Indonesian could understands and speak Indonesian (sometime mixed with local dialects), and truly feel that Indonesian is their own language. Something that only a handful of nations could imitate."
"It is only mention as a footnote in textbooks, a Chapter 0 before Chapter 1 when the glorious white man Standfoot Waffles introduced the light of civilisation to this backwards place.

They do not ever mention political entities or how they interacted. I've tried telling one of my classmates on this, pointing out the presence of states like the Srivijaya, the Sultanates of Singapura, Malacca, Johor, as well as the records written by the Portuguese and Malays, but he just kept repeating over and over again about how little we know like a broken recorder who also doesn't have ears.

"hey, sometimes as guys, we just need a little reminder. make known to him that this means a lot to you, even if it does not to him. if he loves and cherishes you, then he will change for the better. it's about communication now.i'm sure you love him, and he does love you, but some guys being idiots we don't know how to express it or are aware of the lack of it. so just give him a reminder, and then he has no reason to not do it already.also, the day has not arrived yet, why feel disappointed and sad? there is still a way to fix the situation :) it's not too late yet.sometimes you want to try to test him, but then i think this is when you should take the lead to remind him.all the best :)"

"It's been quite some time since I felt so happy in my life. Gaming has been a big part of my life and what helped me get through my rough teenage years.Today I decided to play some games that I had and I felt like that happy 15 year old kid again and what made it even better was that I got to play against my bro after so many years since my pc has been faulty for a long time but still works.I cried today when I prayed, I've never been so thankful in my life that today I feel happy againI might wake up feeling sad again like how I always do but at least today is a day I will remember"

Guys what hair dye products do y’all use to color your hair uh? I went to salon but they color they did was almost non existent.. like under the sun then can see lmao
"If you've got virgin, pigmented hair, it's natural that it's harder for lighter colours to have a harder time showing up. What colour did you try doing?If you're unsatisfied, you can also head back to the salon and request that they adjust it. Most places should do it, although ngl, I've never done it before despite having been tremendously disappointed."
I see.. I tried light brown! Haha feels a little bad to go back just for that though

"Question for gym bros. I am trying to calculate my TDEE with an online calculator. What exactly does ""moderate exercise"" mean?I have just started the PPL program from /r/fitness this early Feb. Though the program asks for PPLPPLR, I am taking 2 rest days instead (PPLRPPLR). I am also cycling 20-30 mins daily, tho at a casual pace (about 15km/h), nothing intense. Is picking ""moderate exercise"" on the calculator right for me?"
"you can try experimenting at the stipulated calorie (with a surplus if youre trying to gain weight). weigh yourself for a week and see if there’s any weight gain (preferably 0.5-1kg each week). if you’re gaining above that range, cut back on your calorie intake. make sure your protein intake is also taken into account (1.6-2.0g per 1kg of body weight, eg 120g of protein daily at 60kg body weight) just experiment and see what works best for your fitness goals. all the best! im running that program too actually."
"Since you're running a 6/5 days/week programme it should be higher than moderate. Anyway, TDEE calculators aren't that accurate anyway so its still best to improvise"

With 50/60, i suggest u go on carousell and hit up some second hands, i cop mine a 150 dollar beginner lower tier starting acoustic for like 50 dollar. Gotta say, a lot of these dreamers bought their guitar and used for like only a few months and gives up and the guitar sits there collecting dust for like a few years. Mom comes in and say hey u dont wanna play it, sell it away, smart girl girl goes on carousell and there u swoop in with a gainz"

Replying to my own comment earlier about Foodpanda being unreliable I was able to export the data of my historic orders and calculate the order times: https://i.imgur.com/zn4RIup.pngMight be interesting to collect this from everyone. I could write a chrome plugin that only collects the necessary information. Would people be interested in this? Even it it's just for the lolz.
"Woooow my friend works at Foodpanda's marketplace efficiency dept and would love this shit you're doing.Would love to contribute data but I tend to prefer deliveroo and order via my phone so I probably can't provide very useful stats. Still keen to see general trends tho, especially if we can do a little comparative against other platforms."
"I'm a bit struggeling with the whole idea. I've been thinking on how we can make other people contribute with their data and there are a couple of uncomfortable things...To make some assumptions we need to the order time and delivery time but we also need to take the distance into account, all that information is available but I personally don't want to store information where someone got their food delivered. I could make this all client side of course but I also need to think of a verification part so people can't alter the data being send. Yada yada, the idea is great but I have to think it over!"
Doesnt the time depend on how far the shop is? You should start collecting expected Vs actual times.
"I agree, unfortunately they don't store the expected time. I do know that I normally want my food fast so I select maximum 30 minutes, and I try to order outside peak hours.But it might be interesting in general to see how correct those estimated delivery times are.EDIT: The data does contain the data of the shop itself (coordinates) so we could use that to calculate the delivery time by bike or such."
would be cool!!

"People are just honestly tired of the many stupid questions people post in the daily thread.""if I can't get it you can't too""Spoken like a true lowly intern whom working for the Big 4 is still a big achievement for. Been there done that years ago and moved on to better things liao."

Tysm . Im just genuinely curious thats all .

Woah . What are type of questions they asked and what did you do that you think made you stand out from the rest ?
"depends man. a little bit of luck, sometimes they just like you, sometimes you are just passionate about the industry, it's hard to say. But generally I'd say if you show interest you'd have an edge. Risk isn't hard to get into tbh."
Omo thanks ! What did u do daily during ur internship ? What are skills that u think i shld definitely brush up on to maximise wtv im doing my internship ?
"most importantly you need to know what risk assurance is, and moving forward how you can value add. You should ask people who are in risk assurance to guide on this instead of reddit. As you can tell, lots of weirdos and ego queens here that are salty as piss. Regardless don't give up :-)"

"For those who can't get past the pay wallSINGAPORE - School leavers eyeing a place in a highly competitive course at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) can soon improve their chances through interviews, aptitude tests and portfolios.NTU announced on Friday (Feb 15) that for 40 of its 111 undergraduate programmes, shortlisted applicants will undergo a ""qualitative assessment"" that goes beyond grades to employ a broader set of criteria such as interviews, aptitude tests and portfolios.For the remaining 71 programmes, interviews will also be conducted for high potential candidates who may fall slightly short of the entry score for a degree course, or for those considered based on their talent in fields such as the arts and sports, under the discretionary admissions scheme.With the broader criteria, a prospective student who shows passion for a chosen programme and the potential to succeed may have an edge over a more academically qualified applicant vying for the same course.NTU said the initiative follows its successful pilot last year involving 17 programmes including highly competitive, premier programmes such as medicine and the renaissance engineering programme.The 40 programmes adopting this new approach this year include humanities and social sciences, engineering and science programmes such as applied physics, biological sciences and chemistry, environmental earth systems science, mathematical sciences, materials engineering, and computer sciences.NTU Provost Ling San said: ""NTU's new holistic approach means that our professors are investing more time, resources and manpower to interview and assess individual students. But we are willing to do so, to better match students' aspirations and passion for the subject, as long as they can show us that they can cope with the rigours of their chosen degree course.""But for the right applicant, the advantages can be tremendous. For example, we have admitted students who may have totally missed out on a place in a university if they had not been assessed holistically, and they are now excelling in their programmes.""An example is first-year mechanical engineering student Samuel Fong. With a 2.4 cumulative grade point average (GPA), the 29-year-old polytechnic diploma holder would not have been able to enrol at many universities.Struggling to complete his poly course over eight years, he used to play truant, miss exams or fail his modules, which caused him to be expelled from poly thrice.But had NTU not looked at his other polytechnic grades - he scored a perfect 4.0 GPA for his second and third years - and the impression he made on the professors during his admissions interview, Mr Fong would not have made it to university. Now, he has performed exceptionally well in his first semester, with a GPA of more than 4.5 out of 5.NTU, which is likely to take in about 6,200 students this year, expects to shortlist and interview up to 2,000 students this year for the 40 programmes using the broader admission criteria.Besides admissions, Professor Ling also announced the expansion of the Co-operative Education track where students will complete three mandatory internships - 50 weeks in total - within their four years of undergraduate studies.This combination of classroom-based education and practical work experience comes on the heels of the Applied Wealth Management track, launched last year jointly by NTU and DBS Bank. Under the programme, students undergo two internships with DBS Bank to gain a solid understanding of wealth management, experience client interactions first hand and immerse in the digital banking environment at DBS.This year, the Co-operative Education track will also be available for students taking up four other programmes - mathematical sciences, chemistry and biological chemistry, physics and applied physics.Prof Ling said that with the nature of jobs changing in tandem with the fourth industrial revolution, practical work experience in addition to good grades becomes paramount to help students stay ahead of the curve.These new work-study initiatives add to the 80 degree programmes that currently require students to undergo internships or work attachments.NTU also announced that it will introduce a new leadership programme that will be open to all undergraduates starting this August. It will offer multiple levels of training to enable students to discover and develop their leadership skills and potential according to their interest.Said Prof Ling: ""NTU is committed to assessing and developing students in a more holistic way. Hence, we begin by broadening the way we admit students. Within the curriculum, we begin to provide more 'relevance' by including the work-study option.""Beyond that, the leadership training will further develop the non-academic qualities of students. Both the work-study and leadership initiatives are ultimately aimed at enhancing their success in worklife."""
"As an NTU student, I'm really happy to hear this. So sick of hearing kids saying their grades aren't enough for uni even though they're brilliant in their own ways, it makes me so angry that society has told them that grades are the only thing that matter. It's time for some change around here"
I feel there will be more people out there who think that this is lowering the prestige of our local uni.
"Lol outside of this tiny island, you'll find that local unis don't have much 'prestige' to begin with. They are good at playing the ranking game, produce pretty competent (but not innovative or creative) workers, and that's about it."
Yeah I used the wrong word. I meant lowering the standard of our local uni. A while ago there was a discussion here about how it's not good that it's so easy to get into local uni.
"it's not good that it's so easy to get into local uni.Interesting POV. There are Indian universities that a shit, but have the lowest admission rates in the world, even lower than Ivy League, Oxbridge, MIT. This is obviously due to there not being enough universities to meet demand.But in European countries like Germany and Switzerland, they have the model where it's super easy to get in, all you need is the highschool-equivalent diploma regardless of grades, and you get into ETH, TUM, and other legendary schools. But the drop out rate is upwards of 30% for both schools.So my point is, marketing ""difficulty of getting in"" as 'pretige' is stupid. It makes students and alumni feel good about themselves, but what's the use. Quality of education is everything."

"Hi all,Will be very frank here - I hold dual Malaysian and British passports and I have been in Singapore looking for work since December on a tourist visa under the Malaysian passport, which allows me to stay in the country for 60 days out of every 90 days.I've checked with the ICA and they have advised that as my 60days will be up next week I'll need to leave the country for at least 30 days before the amounts reset and I can come in under the Malaysian passport for another 60days (I checked whether breaks away in SG are included as I was away from the country over Xmas and CNY, but have been told by ICA that these don't apply as it has to be 30consecutive days out of the country, which isn't ideal)My question is, would red flags be raised by immigration if I tried to enter on my British passport to obtain another tourist visa? I'm pending the EP application process and do plan to have all my records in Singapore on my British passport once my EP is granted and so don't want to jeopardize any chance of screwing that up. Or will I have to take the hit and stay out of the country until my 30days are up before attempting to come in on my British passport?Thanks in advance, Reddit!"
"will be frank too.i believe when you enter singapore, you need to fill in the immigration form aka ""white card""theres a section that needs your declaration along lines like... have you entered singapore on a different passport ...my opinion is... be truthful and declare accordingly. else... if found out, its the Authority's discretion to bar you from entering the country and there goes your hope of seeking employment in the Republic.moreover, should you choose NOT to declare and found out, you definately will be asked.. why did you choose to enter on your UK passport instead of your Malaysian p/p this time... and my guess u will have an interesting discussion with ICA on what your response would be.Cheers"
"Thanks for the reply dominiclim, yeah it's definitely my intention to be as transparent as possible, and so will declare on the white card the moment I use the other passport - it's more wondering whether it's an issue that I've been using the Malaysian one prior and not knowing there's this special rule 60day/90day rule applying to Malaysians entering the country (apparently it was implemented to circumvent Johor-ians overstaying in the country on a tourist)"
I believe you can apply to extend your visa as well. Typically they grant extensions if you entered on a tourist visa.
I don’t know the answer to your question but I would advise a cautious approach given you want to live and work here over the long term.
"For sure, definitely don't want to screw up my chances. Thanks for the reply!"
They likely already know you hold two passports.
"Hi there,The truth is, you really need to approach ICA for this.The reason I say this is because everything is computerized and cross-checked today.You may be able to stick to just using one passport for now for everything but it could be a problem later on if you forget and slip up.So just write an email to ICA (using the same explantion), explain whom you are and what the situation is, and ask for ICA's advice in this context."
"Hi there, and thanks for the reply!I went to the ICA building and sought advice on this. Their advice simply was, to paraphrase - 'shouldnt be a problem at the border, you look British anyway'. Literally queued for 2hrs just to be told that.Based on what they told me it sounds like, (without them explicitly saying it), is that it should be no problem entering on my British, so long as I don't decide to enter the country again (with my Malaysian) within the 30day window - which won't happen I plan to be on my British passport all the time from this point on. If I for some reason do get stopped at the border, I can quote the contact details of the ICA officer I spoke to, to resolve it.Thanks for the advice everyone!"
"If I for some reason do get stopped at the border, I can quote the contact details of the ICA officer I spoke to, to resolve it.That is really the important part! Glad you got it all sorted out. So long as you have the ""official"" reply, that is fine!"
"No offense, but your question is kinda stupid.The 60/90 rule is to prevent people from abusing the tourist visa to stay long-term in Singapore. If you were allowed to use your other passport to circumvent the rule, doesn't that mean that the government of Singapore is according special privileges to multiple passport holders? And why would they do that?Immigration offences are one of the only few nonviolent offenses that can carry corporal punishment, so don't even try your luck. Immigration and drugs are the two things you don't fuck about with here."
"Hi, thanks for the reply.From my due diligence and limited ICA advice, the 60/90 rule seems to apply to Malaysia only, whereas a UK passport has a 30-day entry visa, apparently given per visit on entry. Pls correct me if I'm wrong on that as that's what an hour of Google searches has been telling me, and there's nothing on the ICA website to suggest that 60/90 applies to other nationalities. I'll be going again to ICA on Monday to verify this.This is why I'm asking the question, just incase anyone else went through similar issues."
"For my caucasian friends holding UK passports, they are always given a 90-day visa.If they only gave you 60 days (or 60/90 for that matter) my advice for you is to just leave the country for a bit and come back once your EP has been approved or if your 30-day period is over, whichever comes first.I say this as someone who decided to come here while my new EP was in-process (i changed jobs), and I got a not-so-easy time with ICA in the airport for doing so."
"Why don't your employer get u a proper work visa if you are here for an extended period?It's their job to get it sorted so you won't end up on an episode of ""Banged up Abroad""."

I'll be in Canada for several months and I was wondering if anyone here who has experience with getting contacts lenses prescribed and purchased both in SG and CA can advise on which country is it cheaper or more convenient to get it done. Thanks in advance.
"If you can afford to, time wise, Go jb do cheapest."
For sure Canada is more expensive. When I lived there I used to buy mine online from the states.Eye exam will also be more expensive in Canada.Much cheaper to buy contact lenses in Malaysia or Thailand.
"Definitely get them in Singapore / JB and bring them over. Went to Canada for exchange and I don’t think I remember seeing an optometrist / spectacle shop anywhere, so unless you’ll be driving there, it’s gonna be difficult to get to a store."
"Not sure about Canada but as a former exchange student I’d recommend just getting them in Singapore and bringing them over, with 2 pairs of glasses just in case one breaks (it’s happened to me). If it’s just several months, you don’t really need to worry about finding an optometrist overseas."
Yes in Canada and Australia it’s more expensive. Jb is cheaper than sg.
"If your degree and/or astig is high, consider getting your contacts done in JB. Saved me about 50% of what i would need to pay if i made in SG.Alternatively, i saw some cheap lenses made by Ownsday but they don't do Astig.Can't vouch for Canadian optometrist, but the last time i've been there, a couple of years back, it's slightly cheaper than SG (high astic and degree) depending on the brand.Been to an exchange to US for 3 months, brought 6 months worth (cause i kiasu), ended up using 4 and a half pairs."
Pro-tip: try to make sure the horizon is as horizontal as possible next time.
OK thanks I'm very bad at this
No worries man. We all learn something new everyday.
Toa payoh
Actually it's Clementi.
Close but that's not the right block
Its not taken from that new condo thats coming up in clementi right? Clementi Canopy or sthg like that?
"This should be treated as a serious warning sign.We're surrounded by countries (Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines) where radicalization is on the upward trajectory. Unless it is given due importance and preemptive measures taken, It's a matter of time before the ugly seeds of terror start surfacing on our red dot. :'("
"The seeds are long planted lol.We have a significant Muslim and Christian population.Islam is a religion where its scripture tends to be taken literally instead of being reinterpretated to fit modern concepts of human rights and morality.Also, the Christian chruches in SG on the other hand are also getting more and more similar to the extreme Jesus Camp type of evangelist churches in the States."
"Also, the Christian chruches in SG on the other hand are also getting more and more similar to the extreme Jesus Camp type of evangelist churches in the States.This is because the older and more liberal churches in the US (what they call the Mainline Churches) have been on a downward decline for decades. The more conservative and fundamentalist (and in a sense, more extreme though they wouldn't consider themselves such of course) Evangelical Churches on the other hand, are still growing in terms of membership and wealth (in general, anyway). They're the ones churning out the books and the music and course material and such that local churches are exposed to."
"too many folks just listen to the guy with the mic instead of the book they could just read at home, thats often where the most hate and misinformation spreads, from a bad middleman"
"Also, the Christian chruches in SG on the other hand are also getting more and more similar to the extreme Jesus Camp type of evangelist churches in the States.Interestinf that you'd make a statement like this, because there honestly hasn't been much rise of the ""Jesus Camp"" movement, if you get what I mean."
Any source on the upward trajectory?

"I always wondered how they keep their business model afloat. Being free in their services, it seems they sustain mostly on ad revenue, but their ad output dont really look like much to me.If people like social influencers, bloggers and Youtubers etc. are barely able to sustain on ad revenue by themselves as individuals, how does a large group channel like say, Smartlocal sustain for multiple people working on it as their jobs?YT viewership also seems unlikely. It's rare enough to get up to 100k views unless you're JianHaoTan. So where else do they get their monies from... and enough to pay all their employees and office space"
"They get commissioned to do sponsored work. Make a video to shout about certain messages, make a meme that's both entertaining and educational to inform people about the products or services of the advertiser.They're very good at disguising sponsored content as regular content. So if you see a post by them that seems overly corporate (eg govt messages), that's likely because of excessive executive meddling.Source: am advertising manager who has worked with SGAG and Mothership on past campaigns"
"It’s still effective because they can make the content interesting and something that the younger audience will watch. They can reach the specific audience that the companies want.In the case that their outreach are not that wide, companies may partner with them for 2 reasons 1 - Smaller audience means don’t have to pay them that much. Save money. 2 - they may have a very niche audience that the companies want to reach"
It's really the cost that's attractive. CPM on social media and publicity platforms in Singapore is very expensive as compared to other countries in the region.These sites can easily offer rates that beat the paid promotion rate on FB/Twitter/Instagram since they already have a large following and a high trending rate.
"Don't know about goodyfeed since I don't work with them.For your first question, many clients are chasing engagement numbers. SGAG and Mothership get really good numbers. Whether you like their content or not, it works."
Search: Native advertising
Maybe they need to teach the film/show directors (or the advertisers they work with) a thing or two because the product placement in local media is obnoxious
"The Smart Local does a lot of sponsored content. But honestly, I can't work out how they can support so many staff."
and they got eatbook and zula and mustsharenews
"Likely a combination of shit pay for staff and unpaid interns. I also can't imagine sites like mothershit, sgag, TSL etc are expensive to run. Their main costs are probably office rental and employee salaries."
"You should go look at the rates that are charged. Rate card typically already includes the employee fixed costs and a profit Multiplier for the company.Ive seen 5 figures quotes for content stuff, not even full videos."
"If you look at the number of people writing for mothership regularly, i.e., on the regular payroll, there is no way that it can survive purely on ad revenue and sponsored content. I reckon that to keep that portal afloat to support that number of staff the annual budget for the payroll of the writers, IT support, etc., must be between $500k and $1m. When it first launched it was reported in the ST that two well-known and wealthy Establishment personalities were behind mothership. They are listed in the crew: https://mothership.sg/about-us/By way of comparison, middleground, which wound up a couple of years back, had far less staff. Yet, it had stated categorically that it required $15k a month to operate without falling into the red. It barely scraped $2k a month mostly from subscribers/patrons. (Ad revenue was paltry). The same appears to be the case with TOC. It gets around $1,500/mth from ad revenue and some well-wishers. I believe that money simply goes to the editor. Unless I’m mistaken, the other writers appear to volunteer their writings FOC."
"The Middle Ground and TOC didn't do any sponsored work as far as I know. By virtue of their content -- political and not widely popular -- they also surely got much less ad revenue.I think only some of those listed on Mothership's About Us page are paid staff. I mean, they have freagin' George Yeo in there, come on.Anyway I don't dismiss the possibility that they're clandestinely funded by wealthy backers or government-linked sources, but it's entire plausible that they get a lot of ad revenue. They are one of the biggest websites in Singapore. Even at their prime neither of the other two websites occupied those ranks."
Sgag makes a lot of money I am sure. Their FB page has so many ads.
"Almost every other post by SGAG is sponsored on Instagram, so no questions on that.(the s is for sponsored)"
"if you're not paying, you are the product"
theres enough of a critical mass of gullible folks to pay attention to them :/
I think some of them also provide corporate services and produce videos for companies and organizations. Some of their talents are available for hire as host and MCs for events.
"Simple. Revenue from sponsors/partners. They charge a five figure sum (I used to work in a company that partnered SGAG and TSL) for videos and a four figure for articles and images/memes. Look at the number of videos, articles and posts/memes they churn out every day.The ad revenue from ads on their website also cannot be ignored."
"Ads is a lot of money. I published apps as a hobby back in 2010s, roughly 5 or so.1 app in particular took off but still only like 50 k downloads etc.This app somegave me a revenue of 200s for the first few months.Due to new users.The revenue gradually drop to now every 3 months 20ish dollars.Just highlighting the potential of ads revenue."
Ads on their sites.Advertorials.Butt-load of interns/freelancers (low pay and no need to provide benefits like healthcare and leave).
"Product endorsements I guess. E.g. company could pay smart local to write about them in an article, prob just like how danielfooddiary survives"
Sponsorships are a big thing too. Companies pay the sites money to do writeups and articles about them. And one can earn a substantial amount from ad revenue through clicks and views.
"They probably get writers who are freelancers that get paid per assignment as well? A lot of them seem to be young, so probably they don't really get paid that well. Just a guess though."
No idea about TSL.. They have such a huge office with so many staff...
"Ads pays good money, they are the social media experts."
"Product endorsement,but I don't think they are in the black"
"Be it IB, PE, HF, Prop Trading etc in BB firms. I'm 19, currently choosing my college and major.What are your views of universities such as Michigan, Texas, Georgetown, Bristol, Durham with regards to recruitment?

How then are undergrads from these unis viewed locally as compared to the Big 3 in the finance industry?As an Asian, do you get to play the diversity card if you're working in NYC or London? lolWhat are some things I should work on if I'm looking into breaking into such positions?

Michigan is a great choice

"Have heard the ""N"" word being thrown around (with and without the hard ""r"") during my time in the army. I don't think it is just about the lack of cultural and historical understanding, I view this as the adoption of black culture that is being exported (through notable black personalities, largely rap artists), and unfortunately, the ""N"" word is a part of black culture that is being exported and adopted the most readily."
"This.And because Asians do not have the same baggage when using the word so it might not be seen as a slur over a ""I want to sound cool"".In some of their minds ""I didn't take no slaves. I'm Asian we were slaves too."""
"Yeah. I think it's quite a common thing for people to start using inappropriate slurs or signs because shit didn't happen in their area. Example: the use of the n word in Singapore because we hardly have any blacks (locally born ones, at least), and of course, the suppression of the black people were mainly a Western thing (with America being the 'biggest' culprit, having the KKK). Similarly, in Taiwan, there was a hairdressing shop who decorated with Nazi symbols. They were only recently asked to remove all related signs and words.This happens mainly because the atrocities didn't happen where they were located at."
Damn... is this a thing with younger people? I'm in my 30s and have actually never heard it used.
"QFT. Never heard people use the word ""nigger"" in my workplace/social circle.We mostly use ""bro""."
"Everyone is a bro here, especially on Carousell"
"My entire unit uses it with absolutely no racist undertones, it's basically a replacement word for 'dude'.Funnily enough, there's this pretty big debate in the US that the word is a 'black' word and should only be used by blacks. If any race tried to pull that in Singapore it'd be racist."
"Yeah, but they fail to realise that in a globalised world, there is nothing that is exclusive to one specific race, especially something like a word. To make such a bold claim is ridiculous.I know of how some black people kicked up a huge fuss after a Mexican girl tweeted about her lost dog called 'Negro', meaning black in Spanish, claiming that it was racist and demanding it be changed. There are also articles accounting instances when the Mandarin phrase ""那个"" (nie ke) caused misunderstandings between african-american people and chinese people, in fact Russel Peters did a joke about this."
"Nabei?Cb like that also cannot /sOn an honest note, from what I can tell Singaporeans don't really mean the racist comments unless they are scolding you, most of us probably don't care"
"Say ""i want that one"" in Chinese and you would have unknowingly said it"
"Most Singaporeans (and Malaysians) in my experience won’t say nèi gè, we usually say nà gè. I think it’s more of a PRC/Taiwan thing."
True also
The Korean language too holds the possibility of that misunderstanding.
I saw some nutjobs insisting that the Koreans should change their language because 'naega' is potentially racist.

Mrs Obama get down
Hello skipper
Mr Obama? What are you doing here?
I've come to thank you for your great contributions to this country
Bruh its a meme
From the way I see it:I say the word > I'm not hurt > black people feelings are hurtI don't say the word > I'm not hurt > black people are not hurt.Option 2 is a win-win. Not sure why people are so adamant on being allowed to say the word.
"This. The N word is not a random term of endearment, it is a racial slur with lengthy history and holds a lot of weight. Why do people want to use it so bad, especially in a public setting or on social media?"
"This is like asking why Australians say ""cunt"" all the time when it's offensive to American women."
"Because if you listen to practically any amount of hip-hop or rap, you'll hear it used as a random term of endearment/mild insult. So it's understandable that that's the meaning many Singaporeans understand.Edit: lol look at that girl's own Twitter. She recently retweeted:https://mobile.twitter.com/PACOTHASAVAGE/status/1094828324759715840Is it that surprising that Singaporeans use ""nigga"" as a term of endearment when so many black people including her do? Imo either everyone gets to use it like that or nobody does. It's racism you say that one ethnic group can use a word while another can't."
"Is it that surprising that Singaporeans use ""nigga"" as a term of endearment when so many black people including her do?I think that's kind of the point? It can be seen as somewhat radical for a black person to use the word 'nigga' within their own community because they're reclaiming a slur that has historically been used to denigrate and exclude them. It's an act that undermines the power structures within which they have been oppressed/marginalised in its own small (but not insignificant) way, just like how gay people sometimes use the words 'queer' or 'faggot' as a way to affirm their identity/express solidarity with each other. But when an outsider uses a term like 'nigga' to refer to a black person, the word becomes decontextualised and loses its connotation of endearment, even becoming something that highlights difference in a possibly insidious/insulting way, depending on how it is said.Of course, this is not to say that you definitely can't use the term, but given its historical baggage (which is honestly carried even today), I think it's important to at least have some empathy for those who may be personally affected by asking them if it's okay to use the word/how they feel about it. Though I still wonder why anyone would want to."
"It can be seen as somewhat radical for a black person to use the word 'nigga' within their own communitySeriously? After decades of black singers casually using it on radio?Arbitrary distinctions between who can/can't use certain things is how you start racism in the first place.Besides, one can't say ""we're trying to reclaim a term"", i.e. change its meaning from derogatory to neutral/positive, and then when people start using it in a neutral/positive manner tell them ""no you can't use it it's derogatory"". That's the exact opposite of reclaiming a term. That's entrenching its negative meaning."
"Because words aren't sacred. I don't use it but neither would I like being told I can't use it. Feels like old folks going ""eeyer kids nowadays every thing also say fuck and shit everywhere""Also, are we really going to denigrate all black people by feeling they lack contextual awareness?"
"The problem with this argument is that anyone's feelings can be hurt by anything. In the context of Singapore, where usage of the word is evidently not antagonistic, and where black people are a minority even among minorities, does it really matter all that much?"
"I think what a lot of people are misunderstanding when it comes to racial slurs is that it's less about how it's intended, but moreso how it's received. Furthermore, it's important to remember that nobody speaks for their ""race"" or ""ethnicity"" as a monolith, but that different people are going to respond differently to a racial slur depending on a variety of factors that can be hard to predict unless you know that person quite well.For example, if you call a white person in Singapore an ""angmoh"", they probably won't care (speaking in generalizations here). It doesn't hold a history of oppression, brutality, and marginalization. Even if it's intended as a derogatory term, it likely won't have the desired effect.Similarly, if you call a Filipino person ""pinoy"", they probably won't care. To them, this is how they refer to themselves in a very casual way. It does not hold a negative connotation to them. However, there are many Singaporeans who believe that ""pinoy"" is a racial slur for Filipinos, so they may try to use it in that manner. Again, it will likely not have the desired effect.Of course, any word said with an angry or scolding manner will get the idea across. If a white person is in an argument with a Singaporean and they very aggressively call them an ""ang moh"" or, likewise, a Filipino is called ""pinoy""--they will recognize that the person is intending it to be an insult (and a racially charged one at that). They may be insulted merely by the intentionality of the other person, but still the word itself probably won't have a huge impact on the receiver.Now, to bring it back to the context at hand, using the ""N"" word is an incredibly racially charged word for many black people (especially those brought up in the USA and the UK) as it is very commonly understood to be a word used to belittle black slaves and refer to them as ""lesser"" than the white people they lived amongst. So, even if you, as a speaker, have only ever used it jokingly or in reference to hip hop/rap songs and have no intentionality of the word being a racial slur--the word itself can still be incredibly powerful.It is important to point out--as some people have observed--that the ""N"" word has (in some contexts) lost some of its original ""punch"" due to its saturation in hip hop/rap/black media. It's possible that this was an intended effect in order to deliberately de-value the word, but it's also possible that this happened merely by accident. So black people (especially those from the USA and the UK) often use the word very casually and it is recognized in these circumstances that it is being used a stand-in for ""brother"" or ""friend"" rather than ""lesser human being"". Of course, even then it is not that simple as within black communities you can often find people using the word aggressively and more in-line with its original, racially charged, connotation--even towards other black people.So, does that mean that we should try and de-value the word in general in order to make it more universally acceptable? Well, I can't really say, honestly, as I am not a black person and I do not claim to speak for black people. However, I can say that we are not at that point yet where non-black (especially white) people can use the word indiscriminately without the fear of backlash. I doubt that what we need is a vanguard of people to do this deliberately, as I find that people who claim to be using the word ""ironically"" or ""jokingly"" often have a tinge of latent racism still left in the way that they use it. My experience with people using it in Singapore is that they often use it in order to try and get a rise out of an audience, but have not met enough black people personally to recognize the power of the word they are using.So, tldr?Probably not a good idea to use it, even jokingly."
"I think what a lot of people are misunderstanding when it comes to racial slurs is that it's less about how it's intended, but moreso how it's receivedSo if you say something to your friend and you both receive it ok, but someone (not the intended recipient) hears it and is unhappy, then how?Things aren't black and white; There's always context. I'm inclined to say that it's ok to use it in SG given our context here: Most of us don't view the word with its baggage. God bless whoever goes to the US and uses it there, because of the context there"
"You are of course right that there is no clear ""correct"" answer here and that context is always important when considering what is appropriate or inappropriate.In your example, you and your friend have an understanding that certain language is ""ok"" and ""inoffensive"" so if you use the word your friend will not be offended. I think that you bring up a good point, however, that a random passer-by might be offended while your friend is not. I think this is where a lot of people start getting frustrated because they don't want some sort of ""thought police"" telling them what they can or cannot say in the off-chance that somebody will get offended. It's completely understandable that this mentality could also lead some people to feel that the ""world is getting too PC"" and begin to rebel against it in the hopes to bring some semblance of ""balance"" to the equation (maybe subconsciously).I think things are often more complicated than we would like to believe (especially when it comes to human behavior and cognition) and that it is probably too simple to say, ""always be careful about what you say because who knows who could be listening"". That would get mentally exhausting after a while. However, if we are consciously aware of the baggage a word has (and, at this point, I think most of us would be kidding ourselves if we said that we weren't aware of the history of the word)--we are actually doing a disservice to ourselves by using it. Every time we use the word in a casual manner, we lessen the impact of it for ourselves. You might argue that this is a desirable outcome, but the reality is that this effect is not being spread out evenly. Eventually you might get to the point where the word loses its impact to such an extent that you begin using it in contexts where it would be very obviously inappropriate. This could cause some very undesirable outcomes depending on who you're using the word around.I think an easy example of this would be in online communities. Many Singaporeans play online games, and a lot of the communities involved in these games tolerate (and sometimes encourage) a certain amount of toxicity and peacocking. In contexts where there is very little immediate and physical feedback of a negative sort (and, if there is, it can easily be avoided by ""logging-off""), people often get away for long periods of time with saying some pretty reprehensible things. This kind of language gets normalized (especially if this is compounded when some people get socially rewarded when they say particularly reprehensible things) and then other people begin to copy it in the hopes of getting similar kinds of social rewards. However, in these sorts of environments, we are often unaware of the more passive audiences who might be internalizing the things we say.In this example, a system of rewards is set up to encourage offensive and often racially-charged language which can then bleed into our real life interactions. We've all encountered people whose online persona starts to overtake their ""IRL"" language and they start talking about ""memes"" all the time only to find out that they are rarely funny when described. This sort of thing can happen with racial language as well. What seems normalized online can slip into everyday language and, before too long, be used more casually in contexts where it would be more obviously offensive.My point is that the normalization of this kind of speech in our own bubbles of friends who don't mind it can also lead to normalization outside of our bubbles. So, why take that risk? People are often not as good at code-switching as they'd like to believe, and the word has such high potential to lead to a problematic encounter that it seems irresponsible to continue using it casually. Yes, this potential is decreased in a place like Singapore where there are fewer opportunities to meet and offend black people, but, just like our own social bubbles, Singapore often has many people from many diverse backgrounds living there. It's really only a matter of time before normalizing that kind of language creates a problem."
"good post OP!It's really only a matter of time before normalizing that kind of language creates a problem.Guess this is where things become subjective :PJust because something may be a problem, doesn't mean that we avoid it totally. Out of the way analogy, but you wouldn't stop riding in a car, or flying in a plane, on the off chance that an accident would happenI guess for those who do use laden words, the risk of being misunderstood is not something significant enough that they care about"
"I think you have a good point in that we don't want to criminalize (using the word loosely) language just because of what might happen. Of course people should be free to say whatever they want, while at the same time people should be free to criticize things they don't like hearing. At some point each society will decide what is ""acceptable"" or ""unacceptable"" and begin punishing the people who refuse to conform to the social norms that have been established.However, we are finding out more and more every day that there is no reversing the globalization process that reached a heightened state due to the internet and its speed and reach for transferring ideas. Communities that were once very insular are going to continue to be influenced by a converging set of social norms. Conflicts are inevitably going to arise due to this. Probably most of them will be minor and some might even be humorous.That being said, it seems like the most advantageous path to take is one of increasing self-awareness rather than increasing exclusivity. There will always be a place for comedians to pick out differences between groups of people and blow them out of proportion for laughs (we still get some comedians who are outrageously popular for playing off the old ""has anybody noticed that guys do things this way, but girls--they do it this other way!?""). But, in everyday language, it will be more useful to reduce our tactless blunders in how we communicate."
"I would top off these very insightful comments by pointing out that there really isn't a need to use the N word, memes, or gaming insults.The English language has give us an absurd range of words that would fit nearly any sort of situation, and if that was not enough, you can always rely on mandarin or your second language.As Ricky Gervais said before a rule about ""no swearing"" never really bothered him since he had a fantastic vocabulary."
how does making it a racially exclusive word help
"Totally not racist at all.If the Chinese decided to start having a word that only the Chinese could use, it'd be completely racist."
Because liberal logic
"Pretty sure black people in general, regardless of ideology, dislike others' use of the word."
So people can keep building their own mental prisons around words lmao
"“Either all of them are okay, or none of them are okay”"
"I stopped using the N word because most of the people I socialise with online are Americans since I don't want to cause potential discomfort to someone else simply by using a word.The words ""Jap"" and ""Oriental"" are also really offensive to Japanese Americans and Asian Americans, by the way. Had a debate with one of them online about the usage of oriental as it's legitimately a word used by so many Asian brands 🤔"
"That's odd, I hardly ever hear the N word around these parts, tho I know it exists. Wrong audience?"

"Racism is through the mind, not the colour of the skin. If you need to have the right skin colour to be allowed to say the words, and if you have the wrong skin colour you can't say them, isn't that also racism?"
"These people taking offense to words are the ones making the words offensive. For example, in Australia, nobody cares if you call someone a cunt. It's not offensive. That's how a word loses its offensive connotation.So, the more you try to scream racism, the more racist the word becomes. Sit down, accept that the word exists and is mainly used as a joke, and hate the racists who use the word, not the words they use."
"Agree with you, the words that are censored and put on a pedestal become stronger."
"If you want people to stop using a racial slur, you should stop using it altogether."
"LMAO so it's ok for me to use chink and other people can't? If you let people use offensive words and you don't get offended by it, you're doing youself a favour. You're taking away the offensive part of the word."
U know what the word is for singaporeans?
Hahaa i think its sinkie?

How about stop doing stupid things to promote yourself?
Singaporean got use the word nigga meh? I thought the more racist word is ah pu neh neh ?
Why is this news. Who gives a shit about what some model thinks. Are you offended by some word?
"Isn’t the idea that only black people can say that word, the very definition of racial discrimination?I find it oddly hypocritical of them to selectively enforce it on only certain “race”"
"Seeing as that word was used to belittle them by their oppressors and they have now in turn adopted the word and changed its meaning among them is not racial discrimination. If you insist on using the word and you are not part of their community and have no idea of the actual discrimination that they go through on a daily basis to this day because of what happened long ago then don't be surprised if people call you out on it. Racial discrimination does not mean not being able to say a word because of the color of your skin. It's being denied opportunities, service and most of all respect simply for having a different complexion. Clearly you have never been racially discriminated against (I hope you never do) if you believe not saying the N word is discrimination. It's simple respect."
"Isn't an easier solution is to be equal and not let anyone use it. And have it apply to everyone? Isn't that equality all about? If we selectively say only certain race can say certain things, it's just ironical.Seeing as that word was used to belittle them by their oppressors and they have now in turn adopted the word and changed its meaning among them is not racial discrimination.Why don't we just use the word as it supposed to mean? if N-word means friends to black people, then just use the word ""friend"". If N-word is offensive when other race say it, then apply the same meaning to black people as well. Why the double standard?Clearly you have never been racially discriminated against (I hope you never do) if you believe not saying the N word is discrimination. It's simple respect.Way to start judging without any evidence. Though no matter what I say, you would just think that I'm lying about myself."
"Yes in a perfect world that would be ideal. But it isnt a perfect world. The least we can do is be respectful to the stigma that word holds rather than ""jokingly"" saying it. Maybe one day the world would have evolved to a time when words like those don't mean anything because everyone is equal and there are no forces opposing that but there are still. There are literally clans that recruit young kids and brainwash the next generation to believing that they are entitled and worth more than others. Only untill that is eradicated can we actually talk about the use of this word among black people. I don't like the word and I agree that no one should use it but they have a claim to the word and saying they cant say it is tearing down the one thing they hold on to from when their ancestors were slaves. This word makes their experience known and us using it willy nilly takes away from that."
"But we should strive to move to the ideal state right? Every step has to start from somewhere. I'm not saying that we use that word. I'm saying that everyone should stop saying that word. Black and white alike, all should stop using the n-word. Be fair and equal to everyone."
Yes I agree but we are not in that type of society yet. We still have people who are strongly against equality of all races and some people who deny that races are not equal. Untill those people are dealt with can we move towards a world that doesn't let a word dictate how a person's worth is. But that is literally so far into the future I don't think I would see it in my lifetime. Our only hope is grooming the next generations to be kind and not let the color of somebody's skin dictate how much respect they should get.
"You literally said that not being able to say the N word because you are of a difference race is racial discrimination. Not my words, yours. Anyone who has gone through racial discrimination knows what it really means. I'm not saying you've never gone through it and I'm not assuming anything. And I don't care what you say about yourself when we were never talking about yourself.When black people hear another black person say the word it is heard as friend or buddy but when a non black person says it no matter the intention it has a negative connotation to it because they have heard it from people who want them to feel pain. Simply not saying it is basic decency. Not double standard. A double standard is not being able to do something while someone else does for no reason at all. There is a reason to this. No double standard."
I hate replying to people online because I know i get too into it and end up wasting my time. But if you take away anything from our exchange please take away that that word is never okay to be used under any circumstances. I wished it wasn't in songs but taking that choice away from them is not right.
TIL African-Chinese people exist
"If you click on the link in the article, it says she went to CHIJ Katong so she's most likely a Singaporean, with an African descent father and Chinese Singaporean mother."
"There is a Chinese population in Angola, a southern-African country."
Imagine giving so much power to mere words.
"Got not many black ppl in SG. Maybe if you look at CBD areas got more of them. But for the most part, alot of teenagers just use it bc they listen to rap or follow ""black twitter"" accounts or want to be edgy. Racism against black ppl doesn't usually register to my mind for the sole reason that I almost never see them in SG. Main reason for younger SGporeans using the word is due to the westernization of the media they consume."
We’ll stop using them when black entertainers stop spreading them.
"I think there should be a distinction made on the way you say it. If it's with a hard -er as in nigger its almost always offensive but from what I've seen its said with a -ga as in nigga which is used as a term of endearment. I don't get the whole only black people can say it idea. If their intention is to reclaim the word and take power away from being racially charged, attempting to stop non-blacks from saying it defeats the purpose. It gives the word more power."
你哥
At least it's not digital blackface
""
"Basically what the title says. Some are alone, some have a small close-knit group and some seem to be close with everyone."
"Do remember that everyone's experiences are diverse and your sample here may be biased.Nobody is close with everyone, its a matter of how many relatively superficial relationships one is willing to maintain. For some people its zero, but don't let them trick you into thinking its a good thing.Most of my uni friends had about 2-5 close friends each, and maybe a wider 10~15 good friends they could easily reconnect and get closer to.If you have no CCA or Hall or social activity, only show up to campus for class and then go home straight after then its not unrealistic to finish your 4-5 years with 0 friends."
That's true! It'd be nice to also hear perspectives from different people haha. Thanks for the perspective!
"I always go to lectures and tutorials alone, everyone already has their own clique. I only know more people when we are forced to do group project. When I was in JC, a lot of people (including teachers) said that you will make a lot of friends in uni. Sadly, the truth is the other way."
"Not really true. If you’re from certain Engineering courses, you won’t be having a lot of friends even if u stay hall because general engineering courses tend to overload number of modules per semester."
Depends if you're willing to sacrifice your results. It can be a choice. But there are also same people who can partake in hall activities without affecting their results.
Those ones are super rare.
I find it harder in uni to make friends too. There's not as much contact time with other students which is something that works against friendship building (in my opinion)
you just need a few that you know can help you when you are in need and vice versa. Its way better than having a huge group
That's true. One of my fears is that people might not see me as a friend when I see them as a friend
"true it takes a bit of discovery and finding out but when you find the right people that you click with, it will make your life way better"
"In my past experience as long as you're relatively okay, there will always be those chill and nice folks who don't mind sharing answers and study guides with you.As long as you're not in a cutthroat course, that is."
"Well I have a few people who are willing to do that, but they're not necessarily my friend in the traditional sense (no emotional connection)."
There are but it's difficult to take the friendship to a deeper level
Join some cca or if you think u no time then can join some small gathering. Usually uni faculties have their own mini gathering. Can join events organised by clubs to get to know more ppl also
"More common that you will realise. Truth hurts. But that's life.Then again, we may be guilty of dismissing someone as an acquaintance when they treat us as a friend. Just that without us knowing."
I don't think this just applies to Uni students. I am currently in Poly and this can be the case anywhere. Meh.
yeah what i meant was despite the fact that even when you have the same timetables. that's even worse.
"none . I only have lecture buddies who are obviously trying to leech on each other effort . The only people who I consider to be my friends are from my sec and jc days where we help each other out . Friends in uni most of the time are fake asf , whatever they do confirm have some motive one . bleurghhh . I miss the good ol times in sec and jc tbvh atleast we were genuine in wtv we do"
such is life.
":( do the conversations always revolve around studies and gpa? Friendships developed in earlier school years (jc, sec school) tend to be more innocent I believe."
"Yeap and if it isnt regarding studies , it also revolves in internship/jobs . Who got the most upz internship and etc . And if someone got a better internship placement than them , they would bad mouth abt that person like dafak get a life"
"so true.. miss the days in sec school where friends have no conflict** of interests among each other. is like ""eh u there got $2?, we kup in buy ciggarette?"" then a few of us will hide at some hdb staircase to share a pack of smokes. really miss those good old days..now a uni friend/ colleague ask ""eh can lend $5 for lunch?"" i will be thinking.. wtf this fker dun even bring $5 to sch wtf is he thinking?! ...etc.. haiz"
"In SUTD you share your first year together in a ""cohort class"". You spend most of the lessons in these classes and there is more than one group project for each module. You are very likely to make friends.In other universities, the friends you make are likely from the same CCAs or religion (i.e. church).Once again, a few close friends are better than knowing many people who you only say hi to."
"In SUTD you share your first year together in a ""cohort class"". You spend most of the lessons in these classes and there is more than one group project for each module. You are very likely to make friends.Yeah they have the same in NTU, but I didn't make any friends from there lmao"
"I spent my first year in Uni alone completely, known a few acquaintance here and there and just move on with life. Only in Y2 I started making some connections but is nothing like back in the days. I guess this is the way of life... I mean just ask your parents and relatives in their 40-50s, you will not be surprised that most of their close friends were from their secondary/ poly/ jc times"
"im in poly and have no one i'm close with.My groupmates get together during group projects. From that, I thought we were gonna be much friendlier with each other but no. They go back to their own cliques and treat you like an outsider once again."
"I have 4 friends in University, and I am really having a great time. I feel that you just need to find people that you can trust and rely on. Before I met these four people, I had more friends but it was extremely toxic and painful to be around them. Better to have no friends at all then to have toxic 'friends' imho."
"As many others have said, it’s not a unique formula. For myself, I have 3 classifications of friends.The first kind are the ones you usually hang out with, go to classes with or eat with, you guys hang out because you have common interests or are in the same CCA.The second kind are the ones extended from the first, friends of friends, people you may know in hall, they’re just acquaintances that you know enough to say hi or bye too but not enough to jio for lunch or dinner.The last kind is the one mostly unique to academic institutions, friends you know have the answers to everything you need, they are your go to when you don’t know anything the lecturer said and need help. It’s abit sad but it’s how life is.But of course, it’s not mutually exclusive and you could have a mix of the different kinds or even other special kinds of friends, so yeah."
"Hundreds, from cliques in residences to aquaintances in various clubs. But now that we have all graduated, everyone is busy pursuing their own lives that we only regularly keep up with a few close cliques formed out of convenience. Adult life catches up and an expansive social life is emotionally draining."
"final year uni student here. if i really think about it, probably 2-3 legit good friends, and about 5 good acquaintances that i can rely on/can probably be closer friends with if we spent more time together.to address a concern i saw in one of your comments about not knowing if people you consider friends see you in the same light, the way i look out for it is if they put in the same effort in maintaining the friendship e.g. are you always the one jio-ing them to hang out, are they 'friends' with you only to talk about school/ask for notes/that sorta thing. i stopped talking to a lot of people i thought i was 'friends' with when i noticed these little things.honestly it's not a bad thing to just have a handful of good friends or to be alone around school; it's quite a shitty stigma perpetuated by people who still think loners = losers. when i was in year 1 i wasted a lot of time hanging around my orientation group just for the sake of having 'friends' in school/to go to classes/study with, even though i didn't have anything that much in common with them or anything like that (i only still keep in touch with one of them). as some others here have suggested, joining some kind of CCA or even those ad-hoc activities organised by student groups can help, especially since it's more likely for you to find people with similar interests!"
Thanks for the advice! I tend to get a little insecure when my friends seem to be more engaged with other people than with me. Did you leave your orientation group of friends after year 1?
"ahh i know that feel :/ and yeah i did, besides not clicking with them based on interests we were mostly of different majors too so after clearing all the general requirements in year 1 we went our separate ways for classes"
From NTU. Never stayed in hall and just went to school for classes. 0 close friend (but many acquaintances from projects). Totally fine with it.
"Many acquaintance, few friends."
"Short Answer, 1 and many.Academically, I have a single close friend who was from my sec school throughout and graduated without newer very close friends. With a few close friends from camps that grew quite apart.CCA wise, I have tons and tons of friends from hall dance and school clubs. Half of which are acquaintances while the other half are really close.I would personally recommend focusing on student life unless you're planning on further studies or a govt job. Full time now and GPA didn't really matter. Had a Friend with lower GPA scoring higher paying job."
I always get one close friend to hang out with in each semester till they get bored of me.
But how do you know that you'll meet people from your course if you were to join a cca?
"You can try joining a CCA as long as you have not graduated! Maybe you can ask your friend if you can bid together with them if it's not too awkward? Were those people only nice when they needed your help? It's hard to establish rapport with people but don't give up, I hope you can find people that get you. :)"
"Find Singaporean uni students to be more bitchy/scheming. Went overseas exchange (Europe) and had a totally different experience: if people don't like you they tell you outright. A lot more two-faced backstabbers among local students. That said, met a number of good friends at uni too. As you grow older you'll have less time and energy, so just spend it on a few close friends."
"Year 4 uni student here.While a lot of people here generally agree that it's right to befriend any number of people as you desire (they are YOUR friends after all), and I do agree with that, do NOT stop there.However, a bulk of the advice in this thread stems from people currently not in a uni.University, unlike secondary school/JC/Poly is your absolute last chance to truly meet and befriend people. Although you may not relate to them as well as, say, secondary school friends, the connections you end up making and possibly capitalizing upon will definitely help you when you start working.Nonetheless, you should still keep a set of friends that you can trust in, the number is up to you. I personally have ~30 really close friends and I generally try to befriend both my seniors and juniors - both of which can be fantastic connections to have in the future."
How are you able to get 30 and be able to keep up with 30? That's what I wanna know.
30 is an insane amount dude! I would be drained from keeping up with 30 friendships. How did you and your friends go from casual friends to close friends?
"30 does sound like a lot and I apologise for not explaining earlier that I went abroad to pursue my law degree. That perhaps explains why I have so many friends that I consider myself close to.While I still consider my friends in SG as close friends, I admittedly can feel myself drifting away from them in the future since I only meet them every time I come back during my break.The thing is we have a somewhat mutual understanding that we may ultimately head our separate ways and I can definitely see the number going down in the future.As I mentioned in my previous post, it may sound rather dispassionate for me to say that few of my close friends come from uni. Rather, they're more of possible contacts should I need to liase with them in the future.Regardless, for close friends, you naturally will revert to a number that you are comfortable and used to.To each his own for their methods of forming close friendships. Unfortunately, it's a trait which cannot be taught and will be intrinsically developed within the individual."
None :)
"A lot easier if you are staying on campus. Even then it comes to luck - is your cohort keen on community or just cliques? Is the culture of your hall/RC more towards forming communities? I had both good and bad experiences, but definitely left with a bitter taste. Thankfully in my last year, because of how classes were seminars instead, that I got to know more people from my major.In all, I would say the initial ""omg I need to be friends with everyone"" can be misleading. Personally, I am fine with the handful of friends I made. Well, we will see if it holds in 5 years time though."
"You should definitely have some, doesn’t matter how little or many. I once took a mod where I only found out nearing finals that everyone else had been copying tutorial answers from their seniors and had access to a whole lot of past year papers and materials."
"Probably less than a dozen friends and many acquaintances (asking for help/hi-bye friends kind). I tend not to let my slight introvert self to hinder my progress on meeting new university acquaintances.But one thing is for sure, never be ALONE. Stick with people, stay open-minded and network with other people to know more about their experiences."
"Acquaintances, many. Friends, few. And compared to my JC/sec days, the depth of those friendships is shallow. It's sad but I guess adulting takes a toll on sociability. On a positive note, joining CCAs and forming interest groups on Carousell (judge me) helps a lot."
"Don't worry, I won't judge! I'm worried the workplace will be even more difficult when it comes to finding genuine friends"
"I'm taking a part time degree, and have zero friends. Seems to be the norm for us older students."
"I dont have a ""circle of friends"". My friends are all individual me and him/her friendship. Which is kinda sad considering I never once felt I belong to a larger group/team.I joined 'established cliques' before but me being me, I have a history of bad taste in friends and they either turn out to be exclusive shits or abusive friends.After burning some bridges I am just happy being alone."
"Used to have a huge group of friends when i started uni.Drama and shit happened, it affected so many people. The whole group broke upstill hanging with 6 of them now, 3 regularly.Keep a huge circle or acquaintances / professional relationships, and stick to small number of friends."
None yet
"I’m a year two student currently doing a 6 months internship which is uncommon for my course. (They would usually do a summer internship) I can really see all my close friends drifting away, but I think it’s inevitable if you’re doing something out of the norm."
"Today, we commemorate Total Defence Day.We all know the history - TD Day is commemorated every year on 15 February to mark the anniversary of the fall of Singapore in 1942. It's been a while since I left school, but this thread a while ago rekindled my memories of celebrating TD Day...where our schools would do funny things like turn off all the lights and fans to simulate the lack of electricity, give out food coupons to buy only either sweet potato and peanut porridge, and of course, the usual lesson on the five pillars of Total Defence and what it meant for us, etc.As every year passes, the group of Singaporeans who lived during the war gets smaller and smaller, as age catches up. I would think that, as a result of that, today's younger generation (and future generations) would begin to see Total Defence as more of a feel-good campaign, rather than appreciating the true essence from which it began - remembering that in 1942, our country fell to an aggressor nation; a prelude to over three years of foreign occupation, tyranny and suffering. This got me thinking - how relevant is Total Defence today? 77 years since the fall of Singapore, how important are the areas of military, civil, economic, social, psychological (and now digital) defence? Has it largely become something we simply commemorate every year, or is there still some deep relevance in today's modern society? Allow me to share some of my thoughts (and as always, feel free to drop your comments :-))We are our own worst enemyIn my opinion, Singapore is but a victim of its own success. Ever since we regained our way of life in 1945, to independence in 1965, to SG50 in 2015 and today, it is hard to disagree that Singapore, as a society, has advanced rapidly to become one of the leading cosmopolitans in the world. Strong economic and foreign policies, coupled with the determination of a young nation striving to make a name for itself, has really brought us to become a bustling city and global hub within the Southeast Asian region. But at what cost? Well, not being exposed to a truly life-changing hardship at a societal level tends to make us very comfortable at where we are, and as such, gives way to the tendency of us ""dropping our guard"" and letting complacency seep into our everyday way of life. We sometimes read with great incredulity accounts of the ""strawberry generation"" or millennials - a ""soft"" generation of entitled individuals who strongly believes that society owes them privileges as their rights, and yet struggle to endure hardships as a result.It is in this regard that I think Total Defence is relevant, because it is a constant reminder for everyone (not just students or even, lol, civil servants) that we cannot take our successes for granted and that we must continually bear the reminder that we need to always be ready for any challenges to our way of life. More importantly, it forces us to remind ourselves that we are not all that great or even experts at becoming successful, but we got to where we are because of the sheer grit of those before us to weather hardships, and a determination to better the lives of people around them; and just like our forefathers, we ought to embody this same spirit to ride on our successes, but always with a constant vigilance to remain rooted and never complacent because of our successes. I guess also in this regard, the tenet of social defence comes into play, because the challenges we face as a society will really test the strength of how we Singaporeans come together despite differences and unite as one. If anything, reading news like how Singaporeans rallied together during the unfortunate demise of Aloysius Pang, or to the defence of the Gojek driver, or even to demand justice for the heinous mistreatment at the Platinium Dogs Club shows that we indeed have the potential to unite together, which is extremely heartening to know.Digital as the new defenceIf you read the news yesterday, it was announced that, starting this year, there would be a sixth pillar of Total Defence - Digital Defence. Naturally, the main reasons cited for this addition was because of the growing importance of strengthening cybersecurity, and ensuring that Singapore stands ready to respond to threats in the digital domain. Given that we live in an era of fake news, spying, data leaks and the like, I thought that it was a pretty relevant (and necessary) addition to the spirit of Total Defence (after all, it is about each and every one of us coming together to ""play our part"" in defence). We've seen the many dangers that fake news can do to shape people's perceptions and opinions of things, and thus I believe that the digital world will be a necessary fight and fortification in the coming years, so that we as a society can be more discerning to the online content we see everyday on social media and elsewhere.Old World Blues with New World ChallengesIn the last few months, there is no hiding that we have disputed, confronted, and trashed out our differences in our beliefs and approaches to common issues with our neighbours up north (I've posted extensively my thoughts on the issue here. Feel free to read them!). To put it simply (and referring from Darrion Mohan), we are but victims of an old adversary who operates with ""confrontational diplomacy and barbed rhetoric""...akin to the days of old, and as a result, are unwillingly embroiled in a series of disputes over sovereignty and territory. Given this, I would think that two tenets of Total Defence - military and psychological defence - has still a huge relevance in today's world, and ESPECIALLY so given recent events.Since WW2, Singapore has never found itself involved in proactive armed conflict, barring peacekeeping missions overseas and acts of terrorism. Because we have enjoyed peace for 77 years, I feel that we have become somewhat disillusioned at the need for a strong sense of commitment to defence, and as a result, see a steadily growing sentiment questioning the need for NS and/or a large SAF. While I do recognise and admit that it is not really an equivalence (although both countries are frequently cited as being similar in nature), comparing Israel with Singapore really helps to illustrate my point that our circumstances often dictate our psyche. As you may already know, Israel has been embroiled in a longstanding and protracted armed dispute with its neighbours for years on end. I would think that the constant threat of military offensives over territorial disputes somewhat reinforce the belief in Israeli society that having that capacity to defend themselves was of utmost importance, as well as being psychologically fortified to have that will to fight for the survival of their country.As such, it is my belief that the need to hold onto the relevance of military and psychological defence today is stronger than ever. While it is very tempting to throw in cliche sayings like ""you cannot own what cannot defend"" (lol), I guess my main point here is that this is the time, perhaps more than ever in the last 10-15 years, that we need to recognise the importance of NS and having a strong SAF. Everytime the debate on the need for NS rolls about online, I always somehow see the same narrative of ""why NS when there's no war"", or ""why the need for a strong SAF"".....if anything, a strong military and psychological defence (i.e. a strong armed forces with a united body of citizens standing strong behind them with an unwavering commitment to defend their home) is but the right answer in the current circumstances. We may all have our differences in many respects (e.g. politics), but the one common denominator that underpins our very nation is the mental fortitude and resilience of our people to always be ready to defend our way of life against anyone who threatens otherwise.Happy Total Defence Day everyone :-)"
"I probably should add a tl;dr. Is it relevant? Yes, and especially in times like now. 😅"
Please add TLDR :p
"Haha I think i did. Yikes I really need to be better than this.Is it relevant? Yes, and especially in times like now."
"The basics of war and civilizations haven't changed in the thousands of yearsMilitary: No country can expect peace without its own strong military. Even when they are limited by law (modern day Japan) they need to show they are ready to fight any threats and be a deterrence to conflict escalationIn the context of 1942, Percival and some of his subordinates were rather incompetent and slow to react, though there is much more to this2) Economic: No one can fight on an empty stomach or wallet, lots of examples in history eg: The defeat of the Axis powers in WW2, Allied Land Lease agreement3) Psychological: The British home islands is a great example of 'keeping up the good fight' despite adversity. Without it they probably would have surrenderedContrast the US in the Vietnam war, where it was deeply unpopular with the people and eventually led to defeat4) Social: United we stand, divided we fall. Singapore is unique in this aspect as we are made of many different ethic groups and religions. Look at the formation of Pakistan/Bangladesh to see how division isn't a very good thing5) Civil: Law and order pretty much required for civilization to exist, as well as keeping essential services like hospitals running"
What about digital defence?
"'Digital defense' can apply to all the pillars, as its just another form where threats can emerge or used to our advantageToo broad to be put in its own category"
So it should be a “glove” over the existing “hand” symbol?
Oh okay. Thanks for the clarification
"""War. War never changes."" ""War has changed.""The way we fight changes but our reasons for fighting do not.Singapore is a peaceful country, but the problem with constant peace is that we are not mentally prepared for a disaster. In the event of war, this will be one of, if not, our biggest weakness.You can raise awareness through TDD, read up on war and look through history and know the horrors of wae, but even with all that knowledge, you have never felt it first-hand."
Upvote for the Fallout reference man
You missed the MGS one.
"Anyone who thinks that Total Defence is obsolete should go read Bilahari Kausikan's book 'Singapore is not an Island'. To paraphrase, the existence and success of Singapore is an exemption, and for Singapore to continue to succeed, it needs to remain exceptional. Total Defence is a corner stone of that, to ensure that Singapore is assured of the security it needs to continue punching above its weight."
"I agree that Singapore has really been punching above its weight. With that of course comes its pros and cons, the latter being that because we are in a higher weight class, the demands placed on us are correspondingly higher, and so it's up to us to prove that we can do it?I should go find that book you mentioned though, seems like really good read!"
"Yup exactly, the pressure is on Singapore to consistently punch above its weight, less it falls into obsolescence. The world easily move on without Singapore, so Singapore needs to continually prove itself.The book is good, Bilahari has an tendency to digress a bit, but good read nevertheless."
"Just look at what's happening in the US and UK and tell me that total defence is not needed. If anything total defence needs to be made more total, the military readiness or economy of most developed countries are no longer their weak point."
"I think it has really reached the point where defence cannot solely be left to the military alone. Now that the world is become more digital (yes, even in emerging economies), how easily information can penetrate society makes it the new 'battlefield', and if that area is lost, then it would undermine the efforts of military defence. We saw glimpses of it in the Vietnam War, where initially the American domestic population were supportive of the war efforts, but then as more and more images of dead American soldiers made its way to television, the population became increasingly disenfranchised with the war effort, and domestic support gradually waned. I guess something like that of similar nature can happen when a country is under 'attack', and so really as you've pointed out, total defence needs to be made more total."
"fully agree. In this day and age, many 'battles' can take place in unconventional arenas, very different from the days of old. I guess this is why the government is making a big deal of digital defence - in a world where you don't need tons of finances or elaborate machinery to launch attacks to cripple organisations/countries, being adaptable to the changing nature of warfare is of utmost importance to ensure survivability"
"With high standard of living, limited potential for growth due to small size, and more importantly high expectations from citizens, the margin of error our society can withstand is very, very little. And unlike say HK/Macau or the small EU countries like Liechtenstein/Monaco, we have no hinterland to count on.Singapore exceptionalism is therefore hard but necessary, otherwise we have no selling points to international traders compared to other SEA countries.The question is how long can this last..."
"The question is how long can this last...It really depends on how we can adapt and change as the times move along, and in my opinion, we've been doing that really well as the world shifted in the turn of the millennium. I guess this is where economic defence comes into play, and how well we can preserve our place in the global economy by providing that extra value despite not having a hinterland of resources to tap on should we fail"
"Ditigial Defence sounds interesting. Previously, Total Defence was represented as the five fingers on a hand. Wonder how they will squeeze in the 6th pillar."
"Maybe they'll put Digital Defence as one of the fingers, and push social defence to be on the palm since it's kind of like representative of society at the heart of all the pillars...?"
Probably using the newest technology. Like the prosthetic thumb.
"On the pinky side. I remember seeing a video about a nerve-controllable opposable thumb opposing your thumb, and the guy could grip shit in ways we couldn't. Pretty cool"
Yeah! It's very very cool. And the added stability is good. Especially if you are using your phone on the go
"They had no right, they had no say, and they longed to be free one day.But seriously though, remembering the past and having a robust defense is important, but we need to be careful not to exaggerate the vulnerability narrative. It can easily be used to justify uneccessary and unpopular policies. (Fighting against the nebulous threat of ""fake news"" comes to mind). After all, what did the pioneer generation endure hardship for but to ensure that we wouldn't have to make the sacrifices they had to make, to ensure that we could pursue our dreams, free from having to constantly worry about basic neccessities.The best way to defend Singapore is to make it a country worth defending. Instead of just thinking about what Singapore needs, perhaps it's time to think about what Singaporeans want."
"Good points there. Although I’d say the difficult parts in making policies is not just thinking about what Singaporeans want, but balancing what Singaporeans want with what Singapore needs. If policies gave us all we wanted now but at the cost of Singapore’s long-term future, there wouldn’t be much of a Singapore to defend next time.Your fake news point is good too. Being someone who had their secondary school social life destroyed by fake news spread about me (and that was before we had the prevalence of social media), I can sort of empathise with proponents of the war on fake news. Though I must also agree with you that this area has to be very well defined and carefully planned."
u/CrossfittJesus for president!
"But the nature of military has changed.We now have fewer battleships in favour of aircraft carriers/frigates/submarines. Tanks now move even faster and has a lower profile compared to WW1 and WW2 tanks. Planes are even faster and equipped with the latest sophisticated weaponry. We even have a recently attempt at using drones strapped with bombs trying to kill people.You have stated a strong military. But may i ask what is a strong military? More tanks? More ships? More people in the army? Don't get me wrong, a country without a military is a bloody fool. But my question is do we still need that many people to serve to fulfill the status quo?We now have a falling birthrate and eventually in the years to come we will not have a pool to draw on for NS. And we have another can of worms that is female not required to serve in NS but that is a whole other debate to talk about."

My first instinct was to vehemently reject your post out of hand but after thinking about it you are mostly right. You've just happened to sum up pretty well what I dislike most about singapore - the constant small state defensive mentality willing and happy to sacrifice it's sons and needing to maintain a cult of nationalism. I don't doubt that's what Singapore perhaps needs but it isn't a society I want to be part of.Which is a shame as Singapore is great and a success in so many other regards.

Wow low crime really doesn't mean no crime. Thank goodness seems like the alleged pickpocket got caught.

Looks more like an uncle. Uncle steal from another uncle.
Tell me what's wrong then? Don't just act like a smart arse
"Here’s my take on this whole debacle, both men in the picture look like uncles. With their faces obscured, there’s no telling.So honestly, I’m not sure if you’re trying to be all edgy with your non-answer response because you sound like a grade-A douchebag. It’s high time you get off your precious throne and get a clue."

I live in a wetter part of the town but we’ve seen only a few days of rain the past month or so.I’m curious if certain parts of Singapore have experienced much rain at all recently.
5mm of rain at upper ThomsonSingaporeweather.info A site run by a dude with a personal weather station. Lots of stats
"Not much recently (central) and parts of it are starting to become very dry.But for perspective, I’m from Australia where many parts of the country don’t see rain for many years on end.The clouds here were getting darker this afternoon so rain can’t be far away."
It's kinda dark and cloudy now at orchard.crosses fingers
"Only found the road wet from rain one morning out of five (working days) this past week. The rain was probably very light, though, seeing how the cars in the carpark were all still covered in the crud that had presumably collected over a very dry fortnight.Southeast. Stone's throw from ECP."
"It's been really hot in Sengkang, and like no rain"
"tampines hasn't seen any rain at all for a week, not that I know of. the grass is looking a tad withered"
"A ton of rain here in Bishan right now. Much needed, the park was very brown."
yes it has
"It's raining men, hallelujah, it's raining men, amen"
Anyone else notice?

"If it's true, don't know if it's even a bad thing. The argument people made for vaping is that it's a good alternative for normal smoking, but with the laws clamping down harder and harder on cigarettes by the year, you got to ask yourself if it's actually a bad thing to discourage vaping.My view isNot smoking anything > Vaping > CigarettesIf the aim is smoke free, might as well just discourage vaping along the way. I think vaping is a very convenient intro to real smoking that can affect kids. I used to smoke at least 1 pack per day, NS duty can smoke 2 packs, haven't touched in over 10 years, feeling better than ever."
"This right here is quite key.To add on, ingesting a chemical in gaseous form where it penetrates the unreachable parts of the body is bound to cause some impact, short and Long term. We just don’t have enough data or empirical evidence to statistically prove whether it impacts the body in a negative way and if it’s does then to what degree. Even inhaling too much oxygen causes at certain pressures or high concentration of O2 causes severe negative effects. Read oxygen toxicity. So you get the drift.The other issue that the State would want to handle is the situation where people abuse the vape by mixing drugs like THC, etc which could be relatively easily smuggled or brought into the country. The tools/devices for inbound screening must be upgraded to handle such situations, I am not entirely sure how this is being handled currently across the world. This means cost both capital and operating which needs to be considered. I am sure the govt wants to spend the money at other important places.Also, the third aspect where the person above said that it’s an easy alternative to get vaping something, then get hooked on and then upgrade to tobacco. While vaping is a good alternative to tobacco smoking but the reverse is true as well."
Also vape liquids are harder to tax since you can probably mix your own or find some guy to do it for you.
"How is it propaganda? Even though vaping is not as harmful as cigarettes, their use should not be encouraged."
So my tax dollars are going into ads that potentially discourage activities that has a net negative (second hand) impact on my life?
True. Still technically second hand even though your kids get addicted to it.
Wish they would ban cig and intro vape.... Then remove tobacco from vape....
"Yeah. And then also to deal with obnoxious vapers who blow big clouds of second hand smoke everywhere because ""hey! Its cool, healthy and totally not annoying at all! """
Wait actually thats genius
Reverse psychology?
"Jesus christ. I am anti-tobacco, main point being they should also include cigarettes in this video if they fully discourage tobacco consumption/inhalation.The one sided-ness of the advert in question is my main gripe, compounding on the fact that they use shitty rationalizations."
"They're not discouraging tobacco consumption. They're discouraging people who think that vaping is not as harmful as smoking. Ads have a targeted message. Do you complain because a ""Don't drink and drive"" ad doesn't include the message ""Don't drive if you're feeling sleepy?"""
"The focus is on anti-vape, their target audience is people who have the misconception that vaping is harmless, why add in cigarettes and dilute the message?"
all I can say is a big fuck you to those who vaped and turn bunk into a chemical filled gas chamber during NS.

"Edmw had a leak strongly indicating that this was a suicide ah.Fuck man, hope it wasnt because of Valentine's day or relationship problems."
""
I’m the most anti SAF guy there is but damn can they really not catch a break...
"Well if we understand that this death is more of a suicide than their negligence they will be fine, just the news like to sensationalise on touchy issues. Suicides around Singapore are not posted but this one because it has to do with SAF it gets special attention."
They have a large number of people under them. That puts them in a statistical disadvantage for such deaths.
"Haiz, if it’s really about mental health issues, I think society needs to start taking it more seriously, and people without them should really stop ‘kenging’ mental health issues. So that those who really need help, can get the help they need."
"The stigma on mental health is still really strong in Singapore. I think its partially because of how the older generations will react.But it’s okay, it really is. Everyone gets mentally beaten down in society nowadays. And it’s fine if your parents or relatives or even friends don’t get it. Our parents grew up in a totally different environment. The level of mental stress has changed altogether tremendously. All that really matters is you look for the ones that will help you, even if it’s professional help you need.We go to a doctor when we’re physically unwell. The same is necessary when we’re mentally unwell. Don’t be afraid to seek out help."
"Yup and esp if friend that you haven't meet for a while comment on how depress you sound or what.Take note of that cos for me and my parents, we see each other everyday that if our mental state start to shift, it might not be obvious.So when a friend that I have not met for a year told me I sound like I have depression, I thank him and went to see a therapist the next dayThankfully, it seems like I was just a negative person in general, but I am grateful to my friend for sounding it out and my parents saying okay lor, son, you want to go see therapist is okay"
Great to hear that you’re seeking help and the people around you are supportive. Stay strong buddy.
"haha, went a few times and therapist say bo sign of depression after the 3rd session, then okay lor, no need to revisit them le.but still quite surprising that when i first went to see the therapist at toa payoh, i dont think i had any reservation lor."
"Personally, I find Singaporeans view people with mental issues as insane, psychotic and many more negative remarks. I have been a receiving end of some insults because of my depression and anxiety.When I try to talk it out, I always get shut down with remarks such as ""I also stressed. Why you so special need more support?"", ""If you have depression, you cannot smile or laugh. Once you do these, it means you are okay"" or ""Get over it"".What else can we do? Just keep quiet and hold everything in."
"I agree with you. It seems like a binary mindset in Singapore. You’re either insane or sane, no intermediate stages in the middle. That being said, I don’t think these people are open to changing their minds that easily anyway.Everything is a competition in Singapore. It’s actually pretty sad that even who can cope with more stress can also have bragging rights. Sure, you might be able to take on more stress, everyone is built differently and people need to accept that. Even if we were all equal at birth, the circumstances we’ve gone through in our lives make us all distinct from one another.You can keep it in. It is a choice that many of us end up choosing in the end because of the people around and the fact that it is just an easier way out. However, do not forget that there are things we can do to release them. Perhaps talking to someone may not fit your situation, but continue searching for an avenue to release the stress. Play the guitar, play computer games, listen to classical music, dance, sing, read your favourite book or spend time with your family. Just do something that you love or with people that you love, and these pent up things will somehow be released, or at least seem like less of a big deal.You can pm me if you need someone to talk to. May not be very helpful but I’m willing to try and help out.Stay strong too buddy."
"Spoke to some psychiatrists at a local hospital about an idea - was told that theyre still at the bottom of the funding chain.Until that changes, which will take a significant cultural shift, I don't see how the situation will improve."
"Rip. The SAF is really getting hammered these few months, huh."
"I wrote a post talking about suicide and mental illness previously, seems all the more relevant now given the likely circumstances and the online rumors. As I've said before, we need to be proactive in looking out for one another, especially those whom we have regular contact. RIP soldier, I'm sorry you had to go this way."
RIP... and SAF’s media team must be having their worst times of their lives
"You can tell they are putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that it was ""non-training related""."
They will be back to duty doing nothing once they sweep it under the rug don't worry about it
Yea.. Its quite sad tbh.
"Look after yourself and your buddies, especially if you’re in the army. You’re more bonded in a strong cohesive community."
Sorry if I didn't read the article properly but it could have been something else other than suicide? Like a heart attack?
"The article mentioned it was due to unnatural causes. If I'm not wrong, a heart attack would be considered a natural death?"
It was suicide based on what I was told by some guys currently in camp. He hung himself using a cable. RIP.
There was a whatsapp message shown in the edmw thread that suggest it was sucide
I love how more than half the article had nothing to do with the incident.
RIP :(
There is a lot of concerns after the media highlight death in NS. The article actually gives me more doubt than a clear picture. Could someone explain to me what the following means?Police suspect no foul play but yet its classified as unnatural death.
"That means they suspect he wasn't murdered but instead could have died in ways that's not natural for humans(ie accidents,overdose,suicide)."
thanks for explaining. it's sad to see another life lost.
"No foul play means his death was not at the hands of another party, hence the word “play” in the term. Unnatural means the police dont know the cause yet"
"thanks, I am still not used to some of the jargons."
It not yet confirm to be suicide or mental health issueSo let not arouse any more unnecessary information
"Yes, thank you for saying this, I feel so mad when I see everyone jumping the gun."
"I just hope everyone here would just stop jumping the gun about what happen. For once, just keep quiet and wait it out. What the media can potray can be different from the truth. It's just rude to say these kind of things when you don't know the full story."
rest in peace

Kaya jam
"Agree. If you are in airport, have a good breakfast of eggs and kaya bread. Nasi Lemak too if I were you. Cheers might sell kaya jam in transit area if you can't go outIf you want to go out, I highly recommend just to chill in Changi Village for the cheap and delicious food or pubs.

Ba kwa aka pork or chicken jerky
Note that some countries (eg USA) do not allow you to bring in meat or meat products so beware
"Really meh? I've brought bak kwa and kueh to the UK just fine. The general rule is that if it's really really dead (completely cooked and sealed) it's fine, whereas uncooked food like raw eggs or fresh fruit isn't."
The US is very anal about meat and meat products
At least the EU tighten the regulations regarding meat rather recently. I've checked last year since I also considered bakwa to bring.
"Note that some countries (eg USA) do not allow you to bring in meat or meat products so bewareWho said it will last the flight? If it was me, I'd be snacking on the plane to come home to an empty pack"
whats chicken jerky
"laksa instant noodle, its the best in the world according to many youtube channels"
Prima Taste?
"It’s really not that great though:( I was so excited to find it in a tiny asian supermarket in the states cos I was really homesick and it was not even close to being good, much less authentic."
"Yeah, I think that it's just unique for foreigners to like it. It's not like that sort of laksa is common. Same reason for Indomie, apparently some people go absolute bonkers for it.I find MyKuali brands a closer representation for their white curry flavor, though smaller."
Part of it is because relative to other instant noodles it is pretty good. From that standpoint it is probably indeed the best.
Take a picture with this handsome man.
He’s married iirc!
Lol
"Depending on where you're coming from, Bak Kwa (smoked pork jerky). Common brands include Bee Cheng Hiang (follow your nose), https://www.beechenghiang.com.sg/Get one slice fresh, and the vacuum packed bite sized ones for bringing home and giving to friends."
If you have time you can visit a shop called Naiise (https://www.naiise.com). They have quite a good selection of unique souvenirs/stuff from local companies.
"Or Area 65 (formerly known as Megafash), they're similar to Naiise https://area65.sg"
This.
"If you're looking for non-food items, Singapore is not really known for affordable craftsmanship. Food really is the defining trait of the country. Anything tangible is either commonly found across the world, or belongs to one of our neighboring countries ( eg; batik scarves are sold in touristy areas but they're technically Indonesian).That being said, I'll recommend a few Singaporean patterns for touristy souvenirs that are generally available. I personally collect shot glasses and snow globes, so when getting last minute souvenirs for my friends, these stood out to me.The souvenir shops will have the normal cups, plates, shot glasses, snow globes, etc. The Singapore speciality designs include:the vanda miss joaquim, our national flower. This is basically a purple orchid. The airport shops sell glass figurines, keychains, etc of themthe merlion, the half lion half fish tail figure. This you can find as mini statues, in snow globes or as picturesthe Singapore air stewardess pattern. Not sure how to describe this, but once you see it it's pretty recognisable. Some people would say it's not very iconic, but this pattern that you can find on shot glasses and ceramics is generally more well known than the first twoanything with the singapore skyline - including the marina bay sands, the art science museum (giant flower building), etcAs most of the other comments mention, would highly recommend you try getting a bottle of kaya, or packet of bak kwa (this is pork) if possible. Definitely try our local cuisine. If you can't leave the airport, all 3 terminals have affordable local options in the waiting areas"
"Please don’t buy the “local flavour” instant noodles from the duty free store in the airport transit area, it comes in a fancy packaging and it’s 3cups for $10(or is it $20) which is an absolute scam"
Hae bee hiam crackers (small deep fried spring rolls with spicy shrimp filling). You can get them from bengawan solo at the airport
"thanks for all the suggestions! but apart from food and cuisine, is there anything else I could buy?"

"As one other redditor mentioned, most iconic feature and experience revolves around food. Nevertheless there are some shops in the city that have some nice decor and quirky souvenirs worth checking out. A book on Singlish may be worthwhile also. https://sg.asia-city.com/shopping/news/6-arty-museum-shops-check-out"
"Whenever I leave Singapore, I like to bring along a copy of a Singaporean graphic novel as a gift to friends. There's a few good ones, with The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye being the absolute standout. Kinokuniya has an excellent selection."
"Chinese herbal syrup Nin Jiom Pei Pa Koa, should be available in the heartland shops and supermarkets."

Not a bad idea. Great for assuaging coughs and sore throats. Can also be gotten in single serve squeeze tube form.
"You got 3 hours left. I would say the local instant noodle flavours are good, if not try getting a thousand layer cake or a pandan cake. Also, its still the CNY period so you could probably get some really good deals on CNY snacks to bring back."

"Why would anyone sit for A-levels, then go through another 2.5 years of poly?"
"because their A level results cmi to local u, not enough money to go private u or overseas"
"Thanks. Ouch, how about re-sitting A levels privately. Is that possible?"
"yes it is, but it's not easy and some not confident that they can score well enough even if they retake. at least if you go poly, u can graduate with a diploma and work"
"possible.but it really depends on why they failed the A Levels in the first place.If it turns out that they just don’t suit the JC lifestyle, retaking it as a private candidate may not work out."
"It's really really hard. I think many students who don't do well in A level simply didn't grasp the fundamentals in the first place. Without a heavy amount of teaching, they cannot grasp it on their own"
What is the percentage of this happening among jc students?
"no idea, me for example :). I think the stats are 70% of A level students make it to local universities. some private universities, some overseas. according to the article, abt 200 ppl from each batch for a level students go to poly."
"and the government is rightly doing so, encouraging people who flunk their A-Level to head to local Polytechnics instead of pursuing distance learning degrees."
hmm what advantage do u think local polytechnics have over distance learning degrees?
"Quality in teaching instruction, recognition, possible access to local, subsidised education (if you flunk your As and do well in poly), lastly ROI.starting pay for distance learning deg vs local dip does not vary that much. yet they aren't subsidised."
"Or local u course not the one that they want.If want higher uni acceptance rate, a stronger filter is needed to weed out the weak ones."
what do u mean? isn't a stronger filter mean a lower uni acceptance rate? or do u mean to have less JC and poly slots? so the weaker students will not go to JC or poly?
"Stronger filter for a levels to ensure higher acceptance rate. Weaker students don’t have to waste 2 years attempting A level and just go straight to poly and off to the workforce. Sg don’t need everyone to go uni, someone has to do the lesser jobs.Medicine / law / science / etc have limited slots for each intake anyway unless people desperately (future silver serpent) want to go local through tier 2 courses e.g FASS"
"hahaha it as much as that would work, there are ppl who do very well for o levels and still fk up As. .."
"Add coefficient / factor for those from public school ?Also, not aiming for 100% rate but higher than current one"
"Wtf? If Olevel papers were set by schools, ur idea may have some merit. But Olevel papers are a uniform national exam. How can u even impose some coefficient or watever?"
Acceptance for jc can add the extra factor. Just like ivy where you adjust “Asian” applicants to higher standard (despite everyone taking a standardized test - SAT)
"Does shortened timeline mean you have the option to cram more into 2.5 years or you can exempt some modules?I can see Gen-Ed (using GP or KI), Science, and Econs mods being exempted."
exempt from some modules. most poly courses have have basic modules that have similar content to A levels
Good change. Had many friends who had to go through 3 years of poly after JC. With NS of 2 years it is no joke. Some haven't even enter uni and I'm a year 3 already...
"Hey guise, so recently I’ve interviewed with two companies, and one company offered me while the other rejected me.So I signed the contract sent by company A, and will start my first day in two weeks, but they have yet to countersign.Today company B asks if I’m still interested because they have new positions.Company B gives a higher pay and is nearer to my place, and has a lot more benefits (MNC)Company A is 1.5 hours away from my place so I’d have to spend 3 hours every day to travel, and has limited benefits as it’s an SME.If the offer by B is confirmed, I would really love to be able to accept them. If I tell A that I’ll have to reject their offer after all, will I be legally liable?"
"https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/contract-of-serviceThe contract is in effect when the new recruit turns up for work on the appointed starting date.If the recruit fails to turn up:The Employment Act does not apply, as the employer-employee relationship did not startThe employer cannot claim notice pay or any compensation in accordance to the ActAny claims for compensation by the employer will have to be a civil claim through a lawyerJust inform them quickly (after securing the other job). Usually not worth the trouble to pursue you for anything."
Made sure you get Company B's confirmation first!
^ :)
"they could file a civil case against you but doubt they will unless under exceptional circumstances. also may not be nice to burn bridges, perhaps just let them know that after some consideration you feel it's not a good fit at this point of your career/life. also do so as quickly as possible, least you create staffing problems for them."
This is the true. It is quite common for people to change their mind after signing the contract and ultimately the company wants a happy employee who is coming in and performing at his best. Sueing a nobody who skipped his contract is a waste of time and money unless you are some big name expertise or banker without which the company cannot succeed and they have already made investments based on the agreement that you signed up for.
"As said by u/FriedCuttleFish, employment contracts only take effects on the first day of work, even if it has been completely signed by both parties. This is clearly stated on MOM's website - Starting a contract of service.Let's say that you have actually started work at Company A, you can still quit at any time and work at Company B, after you serve the notice period. Most companies are willing to wait for a while for the best candidate that they deemed is the best and selected.Your employment contract with Company A should have a termination clause that states the notice period, if not the default notice period stipulated by MOM will apply."
"It's totally fine. Companies normal have a probation period to see if you are suitable for the job. Tell them early though so they can find a replacement quickly. They wouldn't take offense, trust me. I was running an sme for while and we had a lot more things to worry about then a new guy who didn't turn up."
"Thanks for the replies guys, I’ll follow the advice given here 😩 I feel really guilty about doing this to the SME tho..."
"Don't feel guilty. Companies are not your friends and don't have feelings. If they could replace you with a cheaper employee they would do it without feeling guilty for you.As for the individual who was interviewing/hiring you, that's just part of his job to deal with situations like this. As long as you didn't purposely cause trouble for him (like not informing him and then ghosting on the first day), you didn't do anything wrong."
I guess that’s true. I’ll let the other company know as soon as I’ve signed their official offer. Thanks!
"No need to feel guilty.Work is work. One day you will realise that you mean nothing to a company and are easily replaceable. It's all about profit margin and overheads.Even if you like your job, NEVER stop looking for new opportunities."
"You can back out as it is within your legal rights, but you have to note that some companies in some sectors are known to have blacklists of candidates who have backed out on confirmed offers.Basically some companies would blacklist you, and you will not be able to apply for jobs with them again in a specified period, e.g. 5 years. This is basically a punishment for incurring costs on their hiring process but backing out an agreed contract."
Maybe someone else can help me out here.Sounds strange for A to send you an offer letter that is not signed already by them. As though they still want to keep the option of rejecting you open.
"Not too sure, but they told me they’d sign it on my first day."
Sounds very shady to me if that's truly what they planned
Your contract will only take effect on the first day of work.
of course. what can they do? sue u?
I read on the MOM site that they could raise a civil suit so I got concerned
in theory they can. in practice nobody does that.
also if they yet to countersign then it is not yet a contract. also have u received a single cent? if not it is also not a contract. u have to receive some $ for it to become a contract (technically consideration)
"Usually there is a probation period when you start work. Once Company B confirms you, tender at company A. It’s a crappy move but Company B sounds much better."
i've heard of companies with clauses about having to pay pack x amount time worth of salary for backing out of a contract after signing. better check your contract carefully.
I think I’m safe with regards to this! The contract didn’t state anything of the sort
"The employment contract typical only starts when the employee shows up for work on the first day.You can still change your mind, just inform the employer. Don't worry, it's very unlikely the company will bring you to civil court. This sort of thing happens all the time (as in people backing out after they signed the LOA)."
"will I be legally liable?Yes. But whether they pursue it is another matter.Usually they don't, and end up you just get a black mark in the company lor so can blow your future employment chance bye bye.Might be an issue if industry is really small and people move around all the time."
Hmm I don’t think I’ll have an issue with the industry thing because I can move between industries haha! Thank you for your answer :)
"3hrs back n forth for company B that’s till Long, just drop that company B because it’s gonna be time consuming and very tiring for you to be working in such company"
Haven't start work then no contract in place
any company that pursues new employees (non C level) in civil court over failure to start work will get shamed on social media and will have to a hard time finding new hires in future . (ie: they better be paying above market rate then)
"Guys i am currently suffering from acne scars (rolling scars and some pigmentation), went to a dermatologist at APAX medical and they are suggesting me to do subsicion and fractional treatments which total about $5000. Anyone has any experience in acne scar treatments? I know they are expensive but are there any options available? My mom is very stubborn and keeps on suggesting to me to go to Aestheticians like those beauty salons (mainly cos its cheaper, which i know majority of time it will be a waste of money as they are NOT dermatologists. Any places for recommendations? NSC?TLDR: got acne scars, treatments are ex, any other options?"
"NSC can still be pricey even if you get a referral from polyclinic. Speaking from experience, I suffered from severe teenage acne and I saw Prof Roy Chan from NSC. I underwent oral medication (doxycycline) and I did fractional co2 laser (which was the newest technology back then) for about $2,000.00 which is quite pricey. After that I visited other independent derma clinics (Clifford Clinic) for the same fractional co2 laser treatment which was significantly cheaper (around $600 per session iirc). In total I did about 5 co2 fractional laser treatments, I had severe acne scarring (mainly box scars and rolling scars) and in total I would say after 5 treatments my complexion has improved by 60-70% which is quite significant. Now there are newer technologies such as the EDGE fractional co2 laser and the INFINI treatment (you can do a bit of research on those 2). It should be more affordable than in the past as the laser treatments are getting more common. I have yet to try the newer technologies, will do when my schedule frees up :)"
"yup the doctor at the clinic suggested INFINI as it's the new thing and they don't offer CO2 Fractional anymore. The price is 4500 for 4 sessions, that's the main thing that's holding me back."
"I’ll recommend for you to try one session first. They will try to hard sell you and say a 4 sessions package will cost $4500 meaning each session will cost $1125, which is more value for money compared to paying for one session. However, you don’t know how your skin will react to the treatment or if you are satisfied with the results. After going for 5 co2 fractional laser treatments I am satisfied with the results but paying $2k for one session at the NSC was my only regret. May I know which clinic quoted you $4500? Maybe you can try some other clinics?"
"I mentioned the clinic in my post, APAX Medical"
"""The new thing"" shouldn't be a driver. There's a doctor specialising in scar treatments Dr Davin Lim (Brisbane) who uses a mix of techniques, as do my doctors, and I believe that's the way to go. I have a mixture of rolling, boxcar, icepick scars across all areas of my face. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst, I've been tested 5-6.I've used RF on their own (Infini, Secret, and a name I've forgotten), and it felt like a complete waste of money. I finally decided to go ahead and spend some money, 2k on fractional CO2 and subcision, and one treatment has yielded 80% improvement in some, 40% in others, so I'd say, 50% overall.Treatments should always depend on the scar type, where it's located, and your individual healing ability, not just the machine alone.Beauty salons don't have such equipment. Doctors treating me to by ""aesthetic doctors"" and ""plastic surgeon""."
"Hey I went to NSC and visited one of the doctors there to consult about acne scars. Mine isn’t too bad but still obvious enough, and he told me that I will at most only see 30% improvement after 5 sessions, which honestly surprised me as I expected at least a 50-70% improvement. He also showed me all the previous patients they had and most of them had about 30% improvement as well. And tbh, 30% is almost negligible to me when I saw their before and after pictures.Should I visit other places instead? Honestly paying $5000 for 30% improvement isn’t really worth it for me. Btw the doc also recommended CO2 fractional but only guarantees me a 30% improvement."
You can try vitamin c serums. Melano cc vit c from Watson’s/guardian is highly effective for redness and scarring. Doesn’t help much with pitted scars but it’s affordable and def worth a try
Has anyone tried Geo Aesthetics? Their google reviews are good but i don’t know about their price tho
"First things first, not all aesthetics clinics are run by dermatologists. Many are run by GPs. However, if they've been in the industry for several years, chances are they should know what they're doing and be able to offer services at a cheaper price than derms and plastic surgeons.Treatments are expensive because equipment is expensive. Infini costs as much as a car. Generally more expensive might not mean better, because there is a lot of hype sometimes, but you also don't wanna use imitation machines, so beware if its too cheap.Treatments are also expensive because sometimes the work is tedious, ie. Subcision.For acne scars, do note that most treatments yield permanent results, so the price might be worth it. I think got acne scars specifically, identifying the right type of scars and using the right type of treatments for thst type of scar is of paramount importance. Results tend to be better if the scars are relatively new and if you're younger.On the flip side, do note that all treatments carry risks, even when done by the most spectacular doctor. Almost all acne treatments have some form of downtime also."
thanks for the insight! Yup the doctor was very patient in explaining all those treatments to me and he is definitely qualified and there have been numerous wonderful reviews about him. That is why i am considering it.
"Apax? He's a GP I think, but from what I've heard, he definitely knows his stuff. Forgot to add that there's no treatment that cna get rid of acne scars. You can only improve on the appearance and make them less obvious.Look at Mark Lee. Years ago his acne scars were quite bad. His skin looks decent now, but the scars are still there."
"Not true. Depressed scars are impossible to be rid of completely, but raised scars are easy to remove."
"And what do you mean by raised scars? If you mean keloids, they're permanent too but can be improved either steroid injections."
I used to do lasers and facials at Clear SK (http://www.clearsk.com) in my 20s. Got good results with the lasers. A package of 6x treatment maybe can cost abt 1k+ or more depending on the type of lasers to treat your concerns. I’m not sure abt pricing now since I don’t go there anymore cos I think I’d rather save my money and just age gracefully. 😬. If you are patient you may try at home chemical peels like MUAC (https://www.makeupartistschoice.com) which may take longer but sustainable results. Of course start small on the percentages and work your way up.
Alright i will check it out thank you very much!
I’m not sure if I’m underflating the laser costs at Clear SK cos I went there like more than 10 years ago and I was a loyal customer for maybe 5 years or more. Prices do change now I believe.
"Hey I went to NSC and visited one of the doctors there to consult about acne scars. Mine isn’t too bad but still obvious enough, and he told me that I will at most only see 30% improvement after 5 sessions, which honestly surprised me as I expected at least a 50-70% improvement.

Btw the doc also recommended CO2 fractional but only guarantees me a 30% improvement."
"Isn't CO2 fractional kinda old by now? Everyone seems to be using INFINI treatment, which can penetrate better, heal better and have a shorter recovery time."
"I’m not sure, I wasn’t really paying much attention but the doc at NSC recommended CO2 laser. I went there about a month ago. But he told me to expect only a 30% improvement at most which is kinda disappointing. And 5 sessions will amount to $5000 in total. I am considering to go other places like Niks or something. Price is not an issue, but I want results."
"Also, if I’m not wrong, INFINI treatment is used to reach deep scars where fractional CO2 can’t reach. My scars aren’t really deep though."
"Co2 laser is still the gold standard. It is harsher than infini, but results are more proven and it has been around for a long time, so doctors are also more familiar with them. Good co2 laser machines would allow drs to push for more aggressive settings more safely."
"I would recommend going to a dermatologist. I went to one and the doctor prescribed me with a pill called Acnotin20. It costs about $150 per box excluding the first time consultation cost and other creams/serums. Its not an immediate cure, but after 3 months there was definitely a big difference. Skin was less oily, little to no breakouts. I believe it was an internal hormonal imbalance that made me have regular breakouts. The dermatologist I went to was Dr Chiam in Ghim Moh. Great Doctor and highly recommended."
"acne scars not v sure, but for clogged pores MyCosyRoom is good the extraction is v thorough (usually facials they spend like 15mins on extraction only, mine was 1h ish bc my pores were damn clogged) and painless (i fell asleep heh)"
"Your mom doesn't know what she's talking about. Stay away from an aesthetician. They are not effective for acne, which is usually a hormonal thing.I went through NSC and they put me on one cycle of doxycycline. It cleared my skin up tremendously. IIRC it costs 300+, medication and consultation included. Perhaps you want to go through that route first?"
"yeah i i know, she was being stubborn. No i don't have acne now, only a few pimples here and there, just acne scars"
Go try Niks Maple clinic! Look for doctor Ong. They offer topical creams that adheres to your facial skin type.

"An excellent account of the true importance of Farquhar's role in establishing Singapore, and of Raffles' maneuvers to take credit himself and remove his more competent subordinate. I understand that Col. Farquhar sued for 'tyrannical dismissal' and won his case, being rewarded with the rank of General."
Ah. A Singaporean Story then
"So interesting to see some sort of acknowledgement of Farquhar's contribution to Singapore.I still rem during my sec school days my history teacher was still throwing shade at Farquhar, like how Raffles placed Singapore in Farquhar's hands but he fucked it up and then Raffles had to build everything from scratch when he came back to Singapore.In similar vein, I wonder how our future descendants will look at the entire Operation Cold Store saga."
"Your history teacher sounds downright incompetent. It was quite well-known among academia what Farquhar and Raffles' contributions were, I remember even reading a comic book for schoolkids that explained their relative roles."
Sometimes it’s less of a competency issue rather than a narrative issue. Also we’re talking 20 years ago so syllabus is probably different.
Oh. Ps I always assume the age group

What's the app to check the celestial stars for Android?

Do you mind sharing the techniques and equipment behind the shot? (: I have an interest in astrophotography but I do not have the expensive equipment required...
"Sure thing buddy. I’m still an amateur compared to many of the pros here so hope I can give a simple explanation to what I did.For planets you don’t need a very high end telescope. Mine is a Schmidt cassegrain, (uses mirrors and lens, looks like a drum but you can use even more basic ones. )Mine was a gift from my Wife that she bought at the omni theatre. The model is the celestron omni xlt 127.For planets you want higher magnification, as opposed to celestial objects like nebulas and some galaxies which you need more light to come through the scope, and in singapore, to get a nice shot of these other objects, you will need tracking and exposure shots to get more light and detail, things that I’m not even trying yet, cos I have a simple set up - tripod, mount, telecscope.Higher magnification is not just from the scope but eye piece (think camera lens). The smaller mm eyepieces give you higher magnification, but also means less light comes through. That amount of light also depends on the aperture size and focal length of your main telescope.So the good news, planets are easier to start with. You don’t need a Super high end equipment . For this, I bought a universal smartphone adapter so I can clamp my mobile to The Eye piece. this adds a lot of weight to one end of the telescope so you need a sturdy set up, with good counter weights. Even then you see vibrations.The Samsung note 8 I used had exposure control so I could zoom and adjust to see some detail, and take a video.To find the planet, I used the android skymap app to spot it.Hope this is clear! PM me if you want more details!"
This is actually a really detailed reply! Thank you (:
"Do you know how to use the tracking thingamajig for the telescope? I have that tracking device that will adjust the telescope so the planet doesn't move, but for the life of me, I can't get it to work"
I haven’t tried! That’s why the planets keep running away from me. Lol. Which mount are you using?
"I honestly have no fuckin idea. This is the motor I have. It's definitely celestron.The problem I have with telescopes is trying to ""aim"" it the right way, especially for planets that move. I have absolutely no clue how to align it properly except for trial and error"
"I think at the equator I will need some mod to my mount like a pier. I use the celestron CG4. Because Polaris is very Low, my counterweight will bang the tripod weight so must buy pier etc for my model so I also sian. Now got computerised one easier, but expensive ."
woahhhhhhh dudeeee thats amazing
Neat. Two moons faintly visible.
Yeah! Usually you can see 4 of Jupiter’s largest moons
Wow. I never thought we would be able to capture such a sight in Singapore considering the amount of light pollution we have.
Planets are really bright so that’s ok. It’s the other deep sky objects stuff that I want to capture that are more difficult .
holy heck thats almost how fast i run away from my responsibilities
nyoom
"You can get a much better image by stacking individual frame from the video.I haven't done astrophotography for a while, but I used to use this free software called Registax."
"I used to use a small desktop dobsonian with limited eye pieces.... Jupiter and Saturn just basically flew past my FOV, then gave up chasing planets and enjoyed a detailed view of the moon!Have you tried taking the telescope out of sg? I took mine to mersing and it was a great time!"
"Wow I haven’t . Only down to my driveway so far. Cos it’s 20kg full setup. But yeah, looking to go out real soon"
"""Old"" ""Note 8"" Pepehands"
"Nice capture! At what time did you see Jupiter and what magnification do you use? Besides the moon I can only find Mars which is quite clear in the western sky at night just that it's very small, only a speck of orange light even at 175x."
This was last year in July/Aug at 10pm therabouts. My magnification iwas 1250/15 which is about 80x For that eyepiece.phone zoom maybe x2.5

"I'm assuming they have communicated the deadlines and penalties for failing to meet the deadlines to you. Though IB official deadlines are later, you are submitting through the school hence you should follow the school's deadlines.

"You can try going to MOE, but your coordinator's response is not without reason. I saw a few comments here that the next IB's in Nov. Go for that.Unless under extraordinary circumstances, i don't see why there should be an exception to rules when you've submitted your work late."

"the IB Diploma programme gives schools massive powers. Fundamentally it is school-oriented, not standardized. It's not like the UK-based system where it's just between you and the exam board, so that you can flounce out and sit an exam as an independent candidate.To be clear, IBO policy is to side with the school on deadlines. If the school's deadline is before the IBO deadline, IBO policy is to cooperate with the school, not with you, to enforce the deadlines the school has set: they will not give you your diploma. This is the ""Candidates must be in good standing at the school at the time of the examinations"" requirement of the IB Diploma - your school has a gun to your head until you actually sit the final. If you pull the ""talk to my lawyer"" card, you will certainly not be in good standing./u/sparkrisen is right - you are going to have to appeal to sympathy that nobody is obliged to offer. I suggest very politely writing an email to your head of department first to beg, apologise, grovel, etc. Then your head of house, then IB diploma programme coordinator, then principal.Be aware that many IB schools do set... enthusiastic... deadlines in the expectation some students will breach them, and the buffer is intended to quietly allow these students to submit their work. If you kick up a fuss about it, the school has no choice except to harshly enforce the school deadline so that other students will believe the threat has teeth. Be cautious who you complain to."
Thank you. This was extremely helpful.
Come I pray on your behalf. That your lawsuit will be successful. What a siaolang.
"Is this even legal? Can they forcefully do this? More importantly, can I sue them for my fees back?Yes, yes, no. Assuming that they have informed you in writing about the consequences of being late in submitting your work. Note that ""informing you in writing"" does not have to be an e-mail or letter specifically addressed to you. It can be an announcement addressed to the wider student body.If they merely put it in the T&Cs and subsequently fails to highlight it, you may have a case, because nobody reads the T&Cs."
I’m not a lawyer but why do you have a case just because it was in the T&Cs and you didn’t read it? Shouldn’t it be your responsibility to read the terms in the first place?
"There have been several legal precedents that have ruled certain parts of T&Cs unenforceable. Most commonly in the software industry where the terms can be long and hard to read without adequate technical knowledge or guidance, and that users are often forced into accepting them for a much-needed service.In this case, OP is unlikely to have a case because submission of work on time is a common rule (especially exam-related ones!) that is widely understood by the general public. The rule is also easy to understand with no complications or contradictions. And it's hard to accept that his teachers had not reminded him about it."

"Yeah, that makes sense. I was just wondering how justified I was before I actually take it up to a higher authority. If I'm in the wrong, then I'll just accept her decision with grace. I'm just not sure how much power the school has over this."
"Let's be clear.You are in the wrong.Right now anything you do is not getting justice or righting the wrongs others visited on you; it is all grasping at straws and pleading to their sympathies.You could accept it, but at this point you might as well try all you can. No harm right?That said I hope you learn from this experience. Some things don't bend no matter what, and deadlines are deadlines for a reason."
"Trust me, you'll have an easier time if you-first try to understand why the coordinator doesn't want to register you-if it's a reason like regulations say xxx, yyy, then take it up with her boss (in a cooperative manner), who would be in a position to make exceptions-if it's a reason like ""this would take a lot of paper work blah blah"" then take it up with her boss also, who would decide how much work she getsBear in mind the school is doing you a favour here. You pay school fees but the school has already done it's due to allow you to sit for your exams. Of course you all are still kids and it's only natural to allow procrastinating kids to make such mistakes, but don't take this for granted and go around threatening to sue everyone."
Is this SOTA?

"I think my previous post got deleted by the mods, not sure why?? Probably because of the title. Anyway, reposting because I need this. Mods, if you wanna delete this, let me know.I'm currently working on a book promoting mental health. I'd like to publish it in sg because I understand the mental health stigma in sg is still quite bad and I wanna do something about it.I would really like to hear your opinions on:Which mental health issue would you like to see more awareness of? (depression, schizo, social anxiety, adhd, etc. Can be anything!)Those with mental illnesses, what are 3 things you wish society would understand about you?What is it like to have an episode? e.g. if you have depression, what is it like during a depressive episode? How do you feel, what are the thoughts going through your head, how do you deal with it personally etc.What are your biggest struggles dealing with your condition?Thank you so much!"
"I think a good thing to have is a breakdown of common misconceptions about mental illness. E.g. depression is just people being emo / weak. You could include a brief summary of what went wrong in the brain e.g. for depression it’s to do with serotonin levels, for those who may then wanna read further. Hopefully when people understand the underlying medical cause they will be less judgemental to those with such conditions. Also maybe something about how important it is to seek treatment ASAP, and why puting it off makes it worse."
thanks! very helpful answer :)
"I feel that the perception of mental illness has evolved drastically over the last 10 to 20 years... In the past we just classify a person behaving as siao or crazy. I remember the hissing and spitting aunties on the public buses. Nowadays, I think most people are willing to reach out a helping hand but maybe people also need to have boundaries and know they cannot simply take on the role of a Caregiver. Not everyone can simply be ""helped"" or ""understood"". So most importantly, we do not need people to fully understand, but we need them to be understanding..."
hissing and spitting?? what the actual fuck
yep i've also sat behind an uncle who kept clearing his throat and spitting (legit phlegm) on the bus floor at least 5 times throughout my journey (which is ~6 stops). Thought he was doing it intentionally but I also suspected it might've been tics.
"oh man :( sounds quite tough to live with. Do you take meds for this?Could you describe what a panic/anxiety attack feels like? Also, what are some of your compulsions?"
"think there should be more awareness on depression and anxiety with the environment that most children are growing up now. Many adults tend not to understand the pressure they give to their children which can easily lead to then developing depression and anxiety. It is only too late when they realise the impacts of their actions by then.try to be more understanding towards one another. We never know what each of us are going through. Reading up on all these issues would definitely help shape the way the society will view mental illnesses as well, leaving the stigma behind. Mental illnesses are like injuries, we need help and time to recover.depressive period - overthinking basically about everything, doubting my own worth towards the world, society, to friends and family. Thinking that dying is probably the best solution, but yet conflicting with the fact that i’ll leave my mom heart broken. The scariest for me was when I realise how numb I’ve become, especially when I used to be a super cheerful person. I sought help — starting from therapies at polyclinic before additionally seeing a psychiatrist. For me it was the medicine (lexapro) that really helped me much better, especially wit regards to panic attacks. But of course i did pick up new hobbies to keep myself occupied, like picking up guitar. It was a bit difficult for me especially when i starting falling into the hole as I had promo exams (JC) around the corner. But to a large extent, I did prioritise my own mental being first.I did see my school counsellor once, but she came off as just priortising studies which really put me off, thus i went to polyclinic instead.biggest struggle is definitely getting the support from people around you. And i think at the start, there definitely was a struggle as to whether it would be worth seeking professional help. Conflict between saving money and trying to get myself better. I know some people also do not feel that their condition isnt serious and are in constant denial"
I took lexapro too and it really helped alot. The side effects are horrible though.
"wow this was very insightful, thank you:) atb with your journey to recovery!"

"honestly curious about the criticism on the SAR in that thread, i've handled the m16, lee-enfield mkIVs and the SAR and honestly the SAR21 feels better to use and easier to handle in my opinionthe m16 is marginally lighter by around 3-400 grams, but is 20 cm longer and feels a lot more unwieldy in long marches and fire movement, especially in FIBUA contexts.300m with a m16 is also far more harder than with a SAR"
"The SAR is through and through a conscript rifle, it's relatively easy to use, quite resistant to hard knocks, muzzle raise is low, bullpup config as you said is much better in FIBUA context, you don't use the fire selector anyway, etcI personally like don't mind the weapon, but its association with NS truly gives it a bad rep."
"M16/M4 with all its attachments beyond its factory version such as scopes, picattiny rails, adjustable stock (which is all used by regular US forces) is a much more capable and prettier weapon. We have something similar like the SAR-21MMS but its deployed in such limited quantities"
Iron sights > dirty scope that cant illuminate in the dark.
Those illuminated tips are hardly maintained so they are completely useless in the dark too =/Will probably be firing tracers at night anyways.
"Excuse me the SAR 21 is over 1kg heavier. Maybe it's because I'm big but it was uncomfortably short too. It's a rifle with training wheels basically. Extra mass because people can't be bothered to control their muzzle, complain about shoulder pain, whatever else. An M16 is also plenty durable, and cheaper. Scope is extra weight too. You can get on one an M16 with the option to remove or upgrade."
"But, does she spark joy?"
"If chamber explosion, pretty sure alot of sparks"
"""Will always have the same weight""Geesh you guys definitely didn't use TES sets, or try the M203 version, or use the TES M203 version"
"Fk that shit man, made me realise how balanced and light a naked sar 21 was."

Don't have the privilege to spend 3 weeks with SAR-21.But I could totally relate to this.
"""Lubricated"""
Had a sar21 live firing during reservist yesterday. Really shitty shots and the scope wasnt zero’d properly had to aim way off the target board to get the shot.Most certainly i lost touch with my raifu :(
"if the scope is not zero'd then thats hardly a gun issue, it needs calibration..."
Reservist guns are pretty bad. I had to aim outside the scope to hit the target

tbf this applies to ALL raifus amiright?No raifu shaming.
"HK416 can get really dirty and really hot without complaining, but she tends to wear out faster if you push her too hard. Make sure to pay attention to her needs, although it'll be a long time before she asks for replacement parts. Even with that, she'll still run whenever and however you want to. She might be a little heavier, but that's heavier in the right places and for the right reasons.Soppo is very modular so you can play dress up with her and she'd love it. Her lightweight body makes her easy to carry and shoot. She's compatible with tons of parts so you don't need to worry about running your wallet dry trying to find proprietary parts. Her low recoil means she isn't pushy and will go along with whatever you're into. Just keep her clean, lubricated and fed and she'll do anything you want."
will always have same weightWhat about SPAS?
"She's already pretty heavy to begin with.And if something breaks inside her, it'll take a while at best to repair her, assuming you've found someone to make the broken part in the first place."

Necessary Singaporean Chinese groans
But dont our servicemen dislike the usage of SAR.i remember reading alot of articles about the SAR 21 being hard to use and accustomed to.shame really cos i LOVE the AUG style shape of it and bullpup cutie.
"People hate dislike it because they're forced into military service, and it's a huge pain in the ass to carry around.It's relatively heavy, it was about ~4.3kg fully loaded, compare that to TAR21 (3.2kg) and K2 (3.2kg). This made it difficult to carry on long route marches (especially compared to the much lighter M16S1, the rifle that the SAR-21 replaced, which was below 3kg unloaded!).The rifle itself is front-heavy, making holding it up in urban ops for longer periods of time quite difficult for scrawny asian men. If I'm not wrong, this was intentional as it reduced the overall recoil of the rifle.The scope, while useful in the range (I liked it), was easy to dirty and even though it came from the factory pre-zero'd, easily un-zero'd itself after a day in the field.The army universally enforced always-hold-onto-your-wife policy made over-zealous commanders go to insane lengths to steal their rifles just to ""fuck the men up"".The most cui rifles enduring batch after batch of servicemen encountered stoppage every other bullet. If you were doing something like CSB that required 32km march + crossing rivers + marksmanship test, you sure as hell won't be passing that marksmanship test due to weapon stoppage.Sergeants/CSMs were absolutely anal about rifle cleaning, you could spend an entire day sitting in the hot sun cleaning your weapon.That, and servicemen associate the weapon with 2 years of time wasted in an inefficient, bureaucratic organisation that shoots blame all the way down to the common man."
Damn. now i absolutely look forward to NS.Great.
"Even though I made it sound really awful, the experience is waaay different from person to person. Some come out absolutely bitter, most come out just fine. I'm mostly echo-ing what the vocal section of NSmen have to say about service.Expect the worst, though."
ofcthe only highlight for NS is the shooting and the gun is supposedly not fun to use
Expect to mostly be using Universal rounds.
dem. But a bullet is still something.
You left out the BUIS liked to chip and the optic had absolutely no way to light up and so was useless at night. Did they ever fix how awful the laser was?
"BUIS liked to chipI knew no one who really used the iron sights anyway, other than as a novelty at 50m shooting?the optic had absolutely no way to light upThe ""sharpshooter"" variant with a 3x scope actually had a scope that had a glow-in-the-dark reticle (tritium probably? I'm not sure). The one's I got to use though were too old, so the paint had mostly faded off and was essentially useless lol.Did they ever fix how awful the laser was?Nope, the only way to get a good laser is to just get a new rifle. And I'm not even sure if the laser was even 'good' in the first place!"
"I knew no one who really used the iron sights anyway, other than as a novelty at 50m shooting?Yeah but you got bitched at for having your wife in a condition that was not perfect, even if it was handed to you in that imperfect condition to begin with. B_BAnd nice to see some things never change. But which I mean ""wow... you'd think theyd have fixed this, its been nearly 18 years."""
"Welcome to Singapore bureaucracy.While there are some good people in there, the ebtire country is basically screwed because the leaders see change as something to be dribbled down to the common man because fuck you."
Hahhahahhahahhaa
Bold of you to assume I have a girlfriend.
"As a current serviceman married to my SAR21, I call bullshit! She is front heavy not light at all especially when she gets a M203 attachment like mine!"
ah so i see you're into the front heavy types?
"Yea, but sometimes when she is on her period it can get a bit much."
Hi 2ic.
Sorry I am just a 1M203
Yep... I know which will I choose.
"Too bad there's no C7 T-doll in game. But then again, it'll probably be M16 with a bottle of screech or crown."

"I’ve seen teenagers & full grown men hanging off the rim, swinging. So it can take quite a bit of weight. Maybe you can checkout YouTube videos of Shaq. To get an ideal of how much ‘accidental’ force is required to perform such a feat of destruction.I’d sign the board & frame the town council repair bill with pride. Had I managed the same."
You're assuming we have the same quality of backboards as the NBA.That's a tenuous assumption at best.
"I’ve played at this court for more than a decade. Seen people hanging off this rim with no damage. Hence the assumption. Maybe you can try the same at a fibre glass board near you before making a judgement?In any case, hanging off the rim is a technical foul. Someone can swing a baseball bat at your shin, break it & claim bad quality as well. Short of Muay Thai fighters, few shins are harder than baseball bats. Point is that it just wasn’t made for that, like a neighbourhood rim meeting Shaq."

"Written by Terence Helikaon Nunis, Former commissioned officer, security and intelligence, on Quora.https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-no-Muslims-in-some-sectors-of-the-Singapore-Army-and-NavySingapore’s SAF does not discriminate against the Muslims. We have a lot of Muslims in sensitive positions. I am, myself, a Muslim convert, and I have never felf that I lacked opportunities because of my religion. The issue is Malays, for historical reasons. The real reason why there were no Malays in much of the SAF is not found in our history books. It is no longer classified, but it is a forgotten episode, just like much of the events during the period of our Separation from Malaysia and the Konfrontasi. For those interested, there are people around who lived during that period, and were there when it happened, although all of them are very old.When Singapore separated from Malaysia, the divorce was painful. In the election prior, when the PAP campaigned in Malaysia for a a “Malaysian Malaysia”, instead of a “Malay Malaysia”, UMNO were outraged and played the race and religion card.The main instigator was Syed Jaafar Albar, the so-called “Lion of UMNO”. He was a radical Malay supremacist, despite the fact that he was clearly Yemeni Arab, and not Malay. He was vehemently against Singapore’s separation from Malaysia, and resigned as secretary-general of UMNO in protest. He went as far as to advocate that Malaysia militarily occupy Singapore.At the time of Separation, almost half of the troops based here were from Malaysia. When the British gave control of the various units to Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei, they neglected to consider that the units were recruited from all over the Malay Peninsula. We had Singapore-born Malays and Malaysian-born Malays in the SAF and the Police, at SAFTI and elsewhere.The 4th Malaysian Infantry Brigade consisted of two infantry regiments of about 1,000 soldiers each. Just over half of them were Malaysian, and they had divided loyalties. They were commanded by Brigadier-General Syed Mohamed Alsagoff, a relative of Syed Albar, and another Yemeni Arab. To say that he did not get along with Lee Kuan Yew is to put it mildly. He claimed it was a joke when he told Lee Kuan Yew that he could have had the PAP leaders arrested and shot. Lee Kuan Yew and his family moved out of the Istana and borrowed the Gurkha Regiment to guard them.The Malaysian troops, all ethnic Malays, mutinied. Just over half of them supported Malaysia. One of the Singapore officers was killed. It was Col. Alkaff, BG Alsagoff’s cousin, who negotiated a withdrawal of the Malaysian troops. The 4th Malaysian Infantry Brigade withdrew from Singapore by November of 1967. The murderers of the Singapore officer were arrested. Two were hanged, and the others were only released from detention a decade or so ago.As a consequence, Lee Kuan Yew used the Land Acquisition Act to dismantle the Alsagoff family landholdings in Singapore. Conscription was instituted, but no Malays were conscripted at first. The commandos, once dominated by Malays, now have none. The Malay officers and NCOs, even though they did not mutiny, were either never promoted or were let go. This included the entire ethnic Malay cohort of officer cadets. And of course, Singapore invited a few countries to come and train our soldiers. Only Israel accepted. They stood by us when we had nothing, and we do not forget our friends.Over the decades, that has slowly been eased. One of the reasons is because we have forged our own destiny as a nation, and there is no longer any real reason for us to doubt Singaporean Malays. This generation should no longer pay for the sins of a generation that has almost died out. Even the Malay community is ignorant of this. Another reason is that due to the low fertility, we need every Singaporean, every citizen counts. We cannot disregard qualified people simply on the lottery of birth. Now, even madrasah students have to serve National Service, which should be seen as a sign that they are trusted to serve their country.Will we have Malay commandos? We already do. Malay figher pilots? We have one, and I still remember that there was a huge discussion behind the scenes about whether we could trust him. Common sense prevailed. One of the reasons we do not have more Malay pilots is simply because they fail the selection test - particularly the mathematics test. We have Malays in many sensitive positions, from SIGINT to MINDEF itself. As long as you are qualified and determined enough, the SAF will take you, regardless of race or religion.We do not have Muslims on naval vessels, but that is due to logistics, not religious discrimination. RSN’s policy is to not have vegetarians, Hindus who do not eat beef, or people who have any sort of food allergies. Our naval assets are meant to be ready for extended deployment. We do not have the luxury of stopping in the middle of a war to look for halal food."
There is an inside joke of 39SCE.China? Ok.Myanmar? Ok.Indonesian? Ok.Singaporean Malay? TAK HALAL!No muslim cookhouse here.
Well at least 35 SCE isn't too far
"39 SCE foodhouse only serve 39, which is two companies of 4 platoons each and a small HQ. The Muslim soldiers can march all the way to 35, and there is a better foodhouse there. Or we can send people to pick up outration every day. Though we would like more food choices in 39 (food sucks), you do not want to pay more taxes to run the halal section (there is a space for that at the foodhouse).While there is no application of chemical biological physics knowledge in A levels, you need to memorise quite a number of things. You might to propose a transparent hard ethnic and religious quota, but consider the pro and cons for that.There is nothing secret in 39 SCE at the men level. All the content can be found on the Internet. I think there was two Malay cadets after my batch, yes, they get outration every time."
"because they fear that malays with bloodties to their family in malaysia will be reluctant to pull the triggerWikipedia - Lee Kuan Yew was asked whether the emotional bonds of various ethnic groups in Singapore could be a hurdle to nation building, Lee replied: ""Yes, I think so, over a long period of time, and selectively. We must not make an error. If, for instance, you put in a Malay officer who's very religious and who has family ties in Malaysia in charge of a machine-gun unit, that's a very tricky business. We've got to know his background. I'm saying these things because they are real, and if I don't think that, and I think even if today the Prime Minister doesn't think carefully about this, we could have a tragedy.You star to notice more malays being in SCDF too."
No la. Main reason is because they serve pork in the navy ship/s
Ironically isn't it more likely that ex-malaysian Chinese are the ones more likely to have been able and have migrated to Singapore but might have family back in Malaysia?
"Even amongst the Chinese, there are differing security clearances which will affect your postings."
"Yup but because of Chinese being the majority, people can't tell."
"MSD can tell.E.g. people born of foreign fathers would never get a high clearance. But for some reason, people born of foreign mothers are able to."
"nobody will say it's ""discrimination"""
That's why you see some of them in SCDF
"Depends on how you see. Many Chinese Malaysians are anti government, this is why in Malaysia you got the DAP party which is a Chinese party. The reason they move to SG is also because they don't like being discriminated, so the risk of betrayal is lower maybe?Also when people come here they get PR and serve first, and many Malaysian PRs are in non sensitive units like regimental police. Long ago my unit got a lot of Malaysian RPs.But in Malaysia PPBM and UMNO and PAS are Malay nationalist parties, they play the race card very much and are much bigger threats. Don't forget Malaysia is a bumiputera society, the government openly favors one race over others."
Openly favors is the key here. :)

"That quite is outdatedand doesn't apply to present day SG. Sitting out NS days 20 years back, there isn't even Muslim cookhouse in many of famous outside of infantry formation. Things have mostly changed. Camps without Muslim cookhouse are in the minority"
"When I entered the air force, my commander tried to explain why there were no Malays in the air force. It was the stupidest story ever.He said ""One day, we caught a man outside the airbase taking photos. When we questioned him, we found out he was planning to bomb the airbase. I'll let you guess the rest..."".To this day, this is the stupidest thing I'd heard in the army."
U see the first mistake is assuming any SAF encik is smart
"Quite sure there are a number to Malays in the RSAF, even pilots like the Lieutenant-Colonel Mohamed Zakir bin Abdul Hamid, Major Yusri Abu Bakar, Captain Azlan Latiff, Captain Iskandar Muhammad..."
"Yes, Zakir was our first Malay pilot and this was in the 80s. And there were others."
"They're more or less token Malays. They're intentionally systematically excluded. I was from 2pdf, security troopers. Trained with a ton of Malay dudes. But none of them got posted to any of the airbases. During my year at the airbase, didn't see a single Malay dudes except Zakir."
"Is there room to consider that they were not posted because they simply weren't good enough?Edit: For the avoidance of doubt, that they weren't suitable as individuals, not because of their ethnicity."
"Nope, postings after 2pdf are largely dependent on proximity to our homes and security clearance. Performance had nothing to do with it. At least 3 people from my unit in the air force had gone to DB while I was there, so it's not like the best go there or anything."
"I shall not presume to know how the system works for security troopers as I was not one but I think calling these qualified pilots token Malays is unfair because becoming a fighter pilot is not something any mother's son can do. Heck, even passing pilot selection and making it to Fighter Wing training is already really tough enough. When the potential pool of people who can do that job is already so small, why reduce it even further with petty racial quotas?Think about this way, a lot of people cry and moan about Malays not being given equal and fair opportunities to join the Air Force as a pilot, but how many of these moans come from people who actually applied (and failed because of ethnicity) and not just those riding on another opportunity to victimise and marginalise a community?I'm half Malay myself and I was posted to air defence back in 2009."
"Yeah, but I'm not talking about pilots. I'm referring to every other vocation in the air force. I refer to Zakir and the other pilots mentioned above as ""token"" Malays not to put down their accomplishment, but in reference to how they're always quoted as examples for inclusion. It's like how universities in the US always try to put an African-american person on their posters.You don't apply to get posted to your vocation as an nsf, you don't apply to go to commandos, you get posted there. 13% of our population are Malay, we should be seeing around 1 in 10 people posted to all vocations being Malay. That is not the case."
seeing around 1 in 10 people posted to all vocations being MalayThis sound like tokenism to me. Why can't we look at them beyond their cultural background?
"I'll rephrase it. You don't need any qualifications to be posted to the airforce as a security trooper. Hence, with all else equal, the proportion of Malays in the airforce should be the same as the proportion of Malays in Singapore (approx 1 in 10). This is not the case. Based on my experience, it has always been 0."
Because Malay lor. It goes back to my retarded commander's idea that Malays are a security threat.
"My friends from aerospace in poly applied for various airforce positions, they didn't get any replies while the Chinese guys got replies if they were successful or not"
There is a lot of factors that is needed to consider leh. I applied for air warfare officer and I didn't get any reply and I am Chinese with Diploma. I remember applying with a lengthy application form that requires to enter personal information and vocation interests and rate which one is preferred.
Encik anyhow lah.
"Yeah, it was right after I was posted to the unit. This mind-numbingly retarded lecture foreshadowed the worst 1.5 years of my life."
"It sounds similar to America’s policy towards Japanese-Americans during the Second World War. Of course, it’s a different situation as the U.S. Government put Japanese-Americans into internment camps. The theory, however, is similar in that the fear was that the Japanese will turn on Americans and fight for their homeland (Japan). When the U.S. Army created a unit composed exclusively of Japanese-Americans whose families were back in the U.S. being held in internment camps, they fought for their country and became one of the most decorated units in U.S. Military history. In that case, national identity seems to have trumped race."
"Idk. I always thought national identity was a bullshit concept.I don't fight for my country. When a war breaks out and I have to pick up a gun, I'll be thinking of my family, my loved ones.""Country"" and ""nation"" are nebulous concepts you really can't relate to.Furthermore, you yourself mentioned that those soldiers basically had their families taken hostage. Precisely where do you think national identity fits in here?The fought hard because if they didn't, their families names won't be cleared, and they will be (falsely or not) seen as traitors or spies."
TL;dr : The Malays failed the mathematics test.
That was funny. True though.
I really doubt this part. What's the source? Link?

"I'm malay yet i find this funng, true to certain degree 😂"
Atleast those muslims in SPF/SCDF learn basic skills useful outside of NS (Eg. Those who were firefighters can easily get a job as a Fire safety coordinator)
"I’d say MP and security troopers also learnt useful skills that are transferable to the security industry.For example, to be a security officer requires 2 basic WSQ/PLRD licensing units. If a soldier was an ex-MP/ST, they automatically get exemption from having to attend those two WSQ courses."
"Those courses take like... A week.I am an ex Cisco apo. The training is honestly not difficult and paid for. I had 8 courses, including 2 weeks for shooting, and it only took 2 months. It's frankly not too much effort, just need to not intentionally block out anything.Firefighting, driving, those are actual skills that take time to teach and are more valuable."

PRC (sometimes), Indians, Indonesians are very kind to locals but never pinoy. They love to stir racial discourse between locals too especially when it comes to Islam."
"Considering the Mindanao thing and the recent Isis invasion of a city, I'd say they would be slightly prejudiced against Muslims. Anyway all the pinoys I've met irl are okay, those I've interacted with online are obnoxious tho."
To be fair most people you meet online are obnoxious
Most arrogant and obnoxious

"Our malay muslim friends serving in sensitive vocations know better than to flaunt in public. Those who like to flaunt probably wont be in these vocations and for good reason. They are just doing their jobs serving their country, not to be the community's poster boy for diversity leh"

There are muslims in the navy.
Sea Soldiers count right lol
Hahhaa count la bro
Ex Sea Soldier reporting!
My platoon (in SAF) had a no-malay policy and the 20+ of us were either chinese or indians. I think it's because we were working in probably the most sensitive area in the country and the 20 odd of us had the highest clearance of any NSFs in the army
"We have to accept that Singapore is very different from when we just gained independence, and every Singaporean son should be eligible for any post during enlistment. I don’t see why a Malay shouldn’t or can’t serve in the commandos, armour, etc.But end of the day, I believe Mindef and Home Team still has the prerogative to decide how they want to deploy their manpower. They can say whatever they want in the media, but we know that when it comes to deployment policies, they may have their own reasons and will never be obliged to explain their position.“Regardless of race, language or religion...” — this is the code which I feel Total Defence should be based on. Oh btw, happy Total Defence day to everyone!"
What unit you working in and what formation?
🤔 his flair says MSD
"Most likely an intel unit (not recon). I rmb during my stay in Sembawang camp, my company had a platoon/section of intel NSFs and they were rumoured to have gone to MSD."
"Might be MP at gombak, guarding gundam hanger ( what we used to call that particular zone, haha )"
Nope I'm not working at gombak haha
Can't say openly
"Won’t ask for your unit but from what you say, you’re from one of those units that requires you to be “interviewed” by MSD right?"
Yup they had a 'talk' with us

No Muslims in Armor since i ROD last year. Why though...
"I know one who is going to ORD soon.Malays in the SAF aren't the majority, anyway, so numbers will be low."
Infantry got alot bruh
I meant for Armor.
"That’s good to hear. During my time, there was still no Malays in Gedong. It’s good to know SAF has moved forward with the times."
"had a few muslims in my unit, ord 2016"
Do you mind sharing with us the unit you were in?
40 sar
"Glad to know. During my time, 40 and 46 were still 100% chinese."
You didn't see any muslims doesn't mean there isn't.
There literally isn’t a Muslim cookhouse in gedong lol. It’s not like he was there for one afternoon and concluded that.
There is now though.
"Bruh, you sure anot? There's more than 1 cookhouse in gedong."
I'm in gedong now and there IS a muslim cookhouse.
"It's in the middle of gedong, beside ATI."
Oooh didn’t know that
"""We have a lot of Muslims in sensitive positions"" not entirely true. A lot of people talk about airforce and commandos, but no one talk about other high key areas like ammunition, arty etc."
"My Hindu friend serves on a LST and he doesn't eat beef, what to do when they cook beef? O know army cookhouse will have an alternative meat dish"
We don't have beef onboard as part of the standard ration load. Only pork chicken fish mutton.
"As a Malay, I AM MAD CAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF SINGAPOREANS STILL DONT UNDERSTAND THR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MALAY AND MUSLIM FFS NOT ALL MALAY IS MUSLIM"
"I know they're not the same thing, but I genuinely haven't met a single non Muslim Malay in my nearly 30 years. and I worked several jobs that are, well, frankly, Malay dominated."
"Probably because those who aren't, are afraid of being ostracised by their own community. I mean, my mother is Malay-Muslim and my dad is a non-convert Chinese, therefore my religion is technically Taoist after my dad, and I get into awkward conversations all the time with people about the why and how, and sometimes even how I should 'fix it'. I've even been mocked by peers on both sides of the racial lines. When I was a teenager I was incredibly angry and frustrated at my own existence. I mean, if the Muslim side of my family is chill with all that, why is it any business of you, right?Can't imagine what it's like for a non-Muslim Malay."
"hey i know the feeling. i got ""eh u makan babi ah"" and ""you chinese tak halal"" in pri sch a lot cos of my background which is similar to yours."
"im 19, and there are a LOT of non muslim malays(friends/schoolmates) , or atleast those that have dropped religion. Non muslim malays are definitely more common in youths today."
"I mean, by a lot, do you mean you've met a dozen of them at school?"
"yes, even outside of school, im also one of them :)"
You're gonna get shitted on if you shouted this in Malaysia.

"This is recent. Prior to 2000, we had only MGBs and the Endurance. The MGBs had a small galley. Now the ships are much bigger.If you are on a sub, too bad"
Much bigger doesn't mean we have separate galleys
"prior to 2000, we had the Endurance class LSTs, MCVs, MGBs, PV/APVs, and MCMVs."
"1 LST, no MCxx, PV has no galley?"
"what do you mean PV has no galley? where do you think we cook onboard ship lol. the PV galley is next to the stairs leading up to the bridge.MCVs were commissioned in 1990/1991, MCMVs were commissioned in 1995. So they were all in service well before 2000."
No MCMV? No MCV? Before 2000? Anyone in the Navy would know better than to say all that. Also the older County-class LSTs.
i would lead a mutiny if you force me to eat broccoli
Only seen 1 Malay dude in Changi naval base. Posted for almost a year
Because Halima Yacob as President already provides enough racial and religious equality
"Will we have Malay commandos? We already do.Source for this point? I only met one in my time as an NSF. Not relevant, but I remember him as an outstanding soldier and leader."
"anyone can verify this story ?The Malaysian troops, all ethnic Malays, mutinied. Just over half of them supported Malaysia.so...half of the troops mutinied and supported malaysiaThe Malay officers and NCOs, even though they did not mutiny, were either never promoted or were let go....and Singapore punished all of them ?...but they are the racists ?...and not the ones who mistrusted and punished everyone from a certain race for the mistakes of some.As a consequence, Lee Kuan Yew used the Land Acquisition Act to dismantle the Alsagoff family landholdings in Singapore.people have been sued for defamation for suggesting less than this. and this guy dares accuses the government of using the law to 'fix' the Alsagoffs"
"Malaysian here.I can offer some context as I've lived on both sides of the border. I understand the fear that the leaders of the time had for these racial and religious groups.First, you need to understand that those things happened when the loyalty to the land or country government was low. The 2 strongest ways to band the masses together were race and religion because those were the only social bodies that existed With a community. Some argue that these are still the strongest types of community ever.Second, in Malaysia the dominant race is Malay. The dominant race in Singapore is Chinese. This is mostly because of coincidence, that Lee Kuan Yew happened to take claim over Singapore and UMNO happened to take claim over the Peninsula. So similarly, the army and enforcement bodies in Malaysia have few non-malays. The dominant race or the race of the politician at that time decided that the group that was with him is the one that needs to grow. That's just how it is; you want to govern, you find a way to make the rest fall in line. It feels very different for me living as a 'minority' in Malaysia and as 'majority' here in Singapore. So many unspoken rules apply to the minority.Third, its likely that from Lee Kuan Yew's point of view, the Alsagoffs were the second instance of 'pushbacks' from the malay community. A third instance would likely have ended all his plans for building a nation. Nurturing a sense of loyalty is difficult stuff and it always begins with drowning out other voices. Only after loyalty has been installed, can a proper discourse begin. (the kind that is neutral, without bias)My opinion is that having some racial bias against me had made some of my choices in life clearer. I automatically ignored serving my country physically and looked for ways to do my part with my mind or ideals. I focused my energy to problems that needed help which had nothing to do with segregation. Sure, I'd have loved to pursue the work of a gunnery sergeant or something. Sure, it'd be great not to feel like theres no chance for that to happen. But for me, the important thing is to fill the other gaps in the big picture."

"Hi, I'm 18 this year and recently flopped 2nd term in my first year of ITE. I have a gpa of 3.08 right now and I don't think I'll be able to make it for 3.5 points by end of 2nd, final year. I'm not keen to take up Higher Nitec as the environment in ITE is horrible.I've been interested in taking private O's but I'm afraid I would not have enough money to pay for the fees which is around 8 to 10k.I'm in my intern now and I've asked my colleague about it and she said I should take up a private diploma in Kaplan. But none of the courses there are what I want.I was actually given the opportunity to take up sec 4 NA in my secondary school days as I achieved 5 A's in NT level. But my family said it would be too hard for me because I would be taking on new subjects as well as learning to understand what NA has been learning since Secondary 1.What should I do now? I feel like I'm stuck right now. And if I take private Os is a do or die because I don't want my parents or myself to invest and waste money on something I would fail on(if we even have the money to.)"
"If you've always been the type to not be able to study/ study hard and consistently, unless you suddenly change your work ethic and self-study discipline it's going to be very hard for you to suddenly do well in O Levels. Of course I think it's the best and fastest way to get a recognised diploma from the local polys, but it's going to be entirely up to you to really sit down and spend many hours a day studying, revising and learning on your own consistently, every single day.Might be unpopular opinion, but private diplomas are useless. Don't bother.Work experience and a good networking connection will ultimately be the best in the long run for you. I strongly advice you to just find a job in your current ITE industry. You can either join Work-Learn Technical Diploma Program (google it, i can't link it for some reason), or work hard, gain experience, and in 2 years hope your company can send you to courses.There is another way you can do.If you are studying a construction-related ITE course, you can take a look at BCA Academy. BCA Academy is the education and research arm of the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), Singapore. The diplomas there are recognised and local universities accept diploma graduates (providing you do well, of course).Ultimately, it's up to you. Like another redditor said, see the the money now as an investment for a better future for you. All the best, if you decide to go for BCA Academy, you can ask me more questions and I'll try my best to help you.EDIT: LinksWork-Learn Technical DiplomaBCA Academy and Admission RequirementsBCA scolarships and sponsorshipsNTU accepting diploma from BCA Academy"
"my “friend” keeps boasting about his private diploma. but you said useless, why eh?"
how about Informatics Academy? is their degree course useless since its private one?
"I think you can still get 3.5 if you get 4 for the next two terms, maybe accumulate some cca points just in case."
yes this is true. but the next 2 terms I'm facing is way too hard to 4. I may 4 for this term aka intern but the next term my lecturers told me only 3 students from last year's batch got a 4 for the 2nd term. that is why I'm leaning onto the fact that maybe I won't be able to achieve a 3.5
"I was able to get a 4 for 3/4 of my terms in hnitec, each team there were also only max 3 people who managed a 4. it's hard but it's doable, I'm sure you can do it especially since you have shown to be very concerned about your educational path.and also just consider hnitec a backup, I didn't like the environment during nitec either but hnitec was a total 180 for me"
Private o level 8-10k? How you get this number?my friend is a private candi and he paid 500plus for retaking 3 subjects .
"That's if he self study right, but OP will probably take classes."
"I think your best course of action IS to go to higher nitec. What is it that you find horrible about the environment in ITE? I was in ITE from 2004-2006 btw, so I can give you some perspectives from another angle if u want."
You can also try to go for the ITE Work Learn programme. Your CA should have the details.
Do you even know what you want to do for a living? Can you go to your secondary school and ask them to retake you?
Self study and take Os again and get into poly?
I'm afraid it'll be too hard and out of reach. and if its really that way then the money would go to waste.edit: I'm already 2 years out of secondary school and all I know is NT knowledge so the jump is rlly huge and I'm worried.
r/SGexams might have your answer.
"If I were you, I would go to kaplan cause after diploma then can get private degree provided you have the money"
"I would love to, but the other thing I'm considering is whether or not the degrees and diplomas are recognised around the world."
"Hi! Have you considered going into the workforce after ITE? you can try looking out for jobs that are related to the courses you are interested in. Otherwise, if you really have the ability to, do consider doing O levels as it would open up alot more options for you. dont be too quick to say you'll fail because with the 10k investment in your education, you would work 10x harder right? atb for final year fam, tough times dont last, tough people do.Also, you might want to post this in r/SGExams to get more advices!!"
"thanks for your reply. I don't intend to work after my ite. If I want to work after my ite I would only earn about 2.8 to 3.5k and I don't think it's sufficient if I were to make a family. I agree, I will work hard for O levels if I take it. but I'm afraid it's too hard and out of my reach since I've already left secondary school 2 years ago with only NT knowledge. if I were to take O lvls, the jump would be very big."
2.8-3.5k right out of ite?
Yes. as an optician.
"imo, that's pretty good. what field do u want to go into? the opportunity costs of getting the diploma and degree privately may not be worth it getting the higher pay and career progression in your case.if I were u, I would look at my options and see if it's worth it. if its worth it, work full time and study part time. if u live frugally, u should be able to cover your living costs and some of your tuition fees."
I'm still not sure as of right now. But I've always looked into the medicine field.
medicine as in doctor? or other healthcare professionals? or biomedical labs techs? pharmacist?
biomedical lab techs and pharmacist.
Lab techs with a degree gets about 3k to a bit more depending on degree. Fresh graduate pay. NUS. Astar gives 3.5k+That's comparable to your optician projected fresh pay.
"that was what I was thinking so might not make sense to continue studying. let's say study full time o levels to poly take 4 years extra. during that time, if you worked for 2.8k a month, you could have earned 134k. let's say u budget abt 3k for o levels (exam fees and minimal tuition) and 9k for poly, total opportunity cost is 146k. if fresh grad earns 500 more per month at 3.3k, it would take 24 years to make up the difference, assuming no pay raise. a lot of assumptions and inaccurate numbers, but it's something to consider"
then I suggest you take O levels and aim to go into poly biomedical science. it's gonna be tough for sure
Need a relevant cert to enter that industry ?
"sorry, to clarify. this amt is only for owndays and some other well known shops. but let's say some optical shops like under hdb I'm not very sure. heard from my colleagues about 1.8 to 2.3k(?)."
Good to have dreams
"Productivity is just a byword for reducing cost and wages and make people do more for less. After years and years of annual productivity drives, there is only so much cost cutting can do for you when the market size is so small. Why not focus on how to help companies grow their presence beyond Singapore and think about how to expand the pot, and not just endlessly stir the same soup every year."

"Nope. Hyperbolic nonsense.Singapore is having a rough time as are many economies - as the well of consumer spending as the driver of economies - continues to hurt developed countries. Moreover, automation is beginning to nip at the sides and governments need to adjust to this new environment.Singapore will get there as the fundamentals are strong."
r/woooosh
one of the many factors
We need to build a wall to stop those bad hombres stealing our jobs.
"It sounds as if something is amiss when patients with the Community Health Assist Scheme (Chas) card, which entitles them to government subsidies at private GP and dental clinics, are charged private rates when those same clinics refer them to a polyclinic for tests.Was this a considered decision or an oversight that has become entrenched?After all, it appears to run counter to the principles behind the Chas scheme and, by extension, the Pioneer Generation (PG) scheme, which provides even higher subsidies for seniors in recognition of their contribution in building the nation.Holders of Chas cards have been means-tested to qualify for subsidies when they are treated in the private sector. This is both to ease the workload at polyclinics, as well as to make it more convenient for poorer people to seek medical care.The subsidies are extended to them at over 1,000 private clinics registered with the Ministry of Health (MOH) under the Chas scheme.Any Singaporean, no matter how rich, who sees a polyclinic doctor is given subsidised consultation, medication and tests.Yet, when a patient with a Chas or PG card is referred to a polyclinic for an X-ray or a blood test by a registered Chas clinic, the patient is charged the full private rate, with the goods and services tax thrown in.Was this because, when Chas was introduced in 2012, this aspect was not examined and the practice of charging patients referred for tests by private general practitioners as ""private patients"" was automatically extended to them?If so, it makes sense, but the anomaly needs to be corrected. Otherwise, it would unfairly penalise the 1.3 million Chas and PG card holders who expect to get subsidised primary care outside of polyclinics.But that was not the reason Health Minister Gan Kim Yong gave to Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC MP Zainal Sapari, who had asked in a parliamentary sitting last month for the rationale behind this practice.In a written reply, Mr Gan explained that such patients are charged private rates as they have not been assessed by polyclinic doctors, who ""are unable to determine whether the ordered tests or investigations are appropriate"".He concluded: ""Therefore, they are considered private healthcare services for which polyclinic subsidies do not apply.""Far from clearing the air, this explanation raises more questions, as it implies that the MOH or the polyclinics are calling into question the abilities of the doctors in private practice to appropriately refer patients for tests.If the diagnostic abilities of these private GPs are in question, then why is the MOH subsidising the care they give to patients with the Chas card? More than $150 million of taxpayers' money is spent on such subsidies each year.On the other hand, if the ministry trusts them to properly treat such patients, then shouldn't that trust be extended to cover the tests these GPs think their patients need?GPs, especially when treating Chas card holders, are aware that their patients might find the cost of healthcare onerous and would be careful about sending them for tests, which, even when subsidised, the patients would have to pay for.Questioning their decision by not extending subsidised tests to patients they refer to the polyclinic is an indictment of their professional judgment.If records show that some GPs tend to frequently send patients for unnecessary tests, perhaps they should be counselled. This would benefit their non-Chas patients too.Many patients were not aware that they would be charged more than double the subsidised amount for tests when referred by a Chas GP.Knowing that, would people be as willing to seek medical care at private Chas clinics or would they again flock to polyclinics where everything is subsidised and a Chas card is not needed?This would defeat the purpose of having Chas. The ministry needs to think this through.It is good that Mr Gan has promised that the ministry will review how it ""can better support Chas patients whose care is managed by Chas GPs, including ways to improve access to clinically appropriate subsidised tests and investigations"".Hopefully, it will lead to better care for PG and Chas card holders, and a more robust healthcare system."
u cld see the ports. which location is this? FASS?
"No....engineering block haha,secret spot;)"

"Looks like it was taken from the Arts Canteen (""The Deck""). Pre-renovation back in 2003, I used to sit there to work on my assignments. I still think the old canteen was much better than the new one."
"Ah, ok, I think I know where now. NUS actually has some pretty gorgeous evening views of the port and sea."

"playing anthem and apex legends, i'm a night owl since i'm not currently working and looking for a job"
"Feeling quite stressed and anxious , just bought grandma to the hospital after she told me she had symptoms of stroke , doc suspect she might have TIA , as of now she’s warded but feeling fine with no weird feeling or pain. Any kind soul with medical knowledge knows if it can be prevented with medicine or is there nothing we can do ?"
"TIA is a small/temporary stroke, usually with no lingering effects. But it should be taken seriously, cos usually it’s a prewarning for stroke down the road. So I would think the doc will arrange for further scans and observe if necessary, cos neurological signs may take time or if there is really a stroke and it may progress.But.... meds wise, probably blood thinners to prevent clots in the future. And exercise will be the best form of medication and prevention. But start small and go slow."
Does anyone know of any good art subreddits? Aside from r/art and r/artporn that shows up on popular.
Thanks! I’ll download them.
What style of art are you looking for?
Something with lots and lots of small details. I fell in love with the drawing on r/art post on the popular page currently and want to find more like that.
I think you might like r/wimmelbilder
Yes! Was about to suggest this! /u/sleepdeepeep you might also wanna checkout /r/ImaginaryInteriors

"Oooh, that’s exactly what I’m looking for, thanks!"
"Don't really want to rant, but it had been about 9 months since I finished my last paper in uni, and I still can't land a job, be it full time or part time. My family members kept on passing remarks such as ''not putting in effort'', ''advertisement can show someone can find a job 6 months after retrenched, why can't you do so despite having a degree?'' , ""If employers looked at your resume and realise that there is such a huge gap, they wouldn't hire you."", ""everyday I see you eat and sleep, eat and sleep, wouldn't you feel tired?""I am really tired of such remarks. I just want to land a job, I don't care about low pay, long hours, far working location, shitty bosses and so on. It sucks to see people finding a job in 2 months after graduation, while I am at home nua-ing. I even apply for part time jobs such as admin assistant, temp assembly worker in science field and lower my starting pay so that I can get a job. Yes, I may seem desperate but I really feel like ranting. I am afraid of what employers may view about me if I told them that I want the job desperately, despite being overqualified.I don't want to be seen as the person nua-ing at home and not putting in effort. A lot of friends around me assured me that it's part of job hunting process, but yet I am affected by words by my family members, it may seem nothing, but it hurt me in a way.Thanks for reading, and I hope that all is well for all of you."
"Thanks for your kind words, they really mean a lot to me right now!!"
"Have you tried looking into sales roles? There are companies selling consumables or equipment to research laboratories.With regards to nervousness, I think you may want to find ways to manage it. Look it up."
"I would say that I have no flair for sales, and sales role wouldn't be something that I would like"
do you mind sharing how did you do for studies and internships? i'm quite curious how come you arent chosen at all despite applying for a job that is lower requirements
"Studies wise, I am an average performer in poly and uni. I was quite lucky enough to got selected for an internship with a research institute back in poly, and I think my interest in research actually increased after going through my poly internship. I am bad at interviews, being nervous for no reason and would not be able to perform well in interviews is something that I am trying to get rid of."
I have actually looked back at your comment history and also thought that maybe you have a huge barrier with interviews. What exactly do you think stops employers from hiring you from your interview? Have you worked on it?
What course were you in?
"Pharmaceutical science, looking at chemistry, pharmaceutical and research and development sector (laboratory related jobs) in particular."
"Your competitors include NUS science grads, where from their last graduate survey, almost 20% were unable to get any jobs 6 months after their final exam. And of the 80% employed, about 30% of them were not employed full-time -- god knows what they were working as, probably interns or test tube washers. And by virtue of the degree's branding and lack of internship experience, you're already below them.I think unless you have advantages over them (e.g. won awards, did well in competitions, significant academic achievements), it will be realistically hard to go into those same industries."
"Hmm, the people I know who did courses tangentially related to that chose to go into academia (phD) or was offered a job by their internship company when some employees coincidentally retired. Sometimes it’s just luck. I just graduated too, and I understand it’s hard. Jiayou and don’t give up!"
"May I ask what uni you were from? Also, how did your internship go?"
"Private uni,there is no internship for my uni course, but back at poly I did my internship in a research institute. I did ask my poly internship supervisor if there is any opening, but he is not hiring at the moment."
"I need to be blunt here. But without an internship, you are very unlikely to be hired, especially with a private degree in science.Do you think you can tahan 6 more months of low pay by getting yourself in for a good internship?"
I did applied for a couple of them but have to wait for them to get back to me.
jiayou!!! it may take time but i believe there is a job out there waiting for you!
Thank you so much for your kind words!! Really appreciate them very much.
I really gotta thank my boyfriend for being so tolerant of me when I get drunk 😅

"Hey graphic designers of Singapore - how much are you earning? I’ve searched around salary benchmarks but there isn’t anything for us graphic designers,l.I’m a senior level graphic designer in an agency and I’m earning about 4k - been thinking of making the switch to in-house, so I’m curious to know what the going rate is like."
"How about this benchmark ""Average Graphic Artist / Designer Salary in Singapore"" by Payscale?https://www.payscale.com/research/SG/Job=Graphic_Artist_%2F_Designer/Salary"
Was at the hospital today and witnessed this young man trying to get his elderly father to drink a cup of water for a test and the father was very grouchy and not cooperative. He rejected him and he still persisted despite everyone's stares. I totally understand the father's feelings as I underwent a surgery a while back and I was equally grouchy. But I still forced myself to be cooperative towards the people that is caring for me.I felt bad for him and at that point I wanted to intervene but I didn't. I hope I won't be like this when I'm old.
"I found that the older I get, the crankier I get.It's that feeling of ""I have been nice to other people my entire life and I am tired of it. Now, I want to do whatever I feel like doing. To hell with everybody."""
We started off as a baby and we are all ending our lives behaving like a baby. I genuinely feel bad for his son as he is really trying and it must be tough to care for an elderly.
Does anybody drink Okinawa milk tea from Sharetea above 0% sugar? It's so sweet already!
"0% still has sugar in the ingredients , applies for any other milk tea . 0% just means they don’t add any additional sugar during the process where they create the milk tea With the ingredients"
"HAHAHA 50% is my go to order, even tho it’s a tad bit sweet for me!!"
It's because brown sugar is part of the package. The percentage sugar refers to the syrup that they add in.I remember HPB used to have this scratch card thingy where they gave you the card if you ordered 0% or less sweet - something like that. I always ordered Okinawa milk tea 0% and felt filthy for taking the card
What. Where’s my card?!
"this was like a few years back kinda thing, it's like you scratch the card and need to match different halves to redeem stuff"
HPB wants to know your location
I remember the staff always recommending 0% sugar whenever I ordered this haha
"wow, 0 percent and the milk tea is sweet? i gotta try this soemtime"
"try it once, then don't do it again!! It's literally diabetes in a cup."
"I too, have a rather low tolerance for sugar.(unless you can fool me that it's honey, then yes please.)"
You sound like the driver.
"Adrenaline can be a powerful painkiller. Not calling the police or at least going for a checkup, is just stabbing yourself in the back. But if no one reports it, then theres really no one to charge the driver either. The longer the delay, the harder it is to track him.As they say, nothing is illegal until you are caught."
The pain will come tml. If that happens the pedestrian has every right to go see doctor and seek personal injury claim
"I’m so fucking sick and tired of the poly enrolment. So much shit to do, the website is shit. Don’t even know if I did everything, my parents not helping at all(and may have my place forfeited because of the information they may have input wrongly).I’m sorry, needed to vent."
Hope You never need to file income tax.The punishment is possible jail time. In worse case.
Income tax in math class was already damn annoying. I can’t imagine filing paperwork on it 😅
Wow you have lessons on it?I guess old adults are geniuses.
"No lessons, just an actual math class. It was such a pain to calculate! My math teacher only barely got the answer because his wife is an accountant."
Even teachers may not get it.So yea. Welcome to the life of adult.
"Yeah, when the websites fuck up, or tech related issues it really sucks lol"
"Hey don't give up! If the website is shit, try calling in or visiting the poly to ask for advice"
They called back and forth two days before my issue was finally resolved :’)Thanks so much though! I might have to call them back because I sent wrong documents to them...
Welcome to adulting :)

Gonna take a nap now and wake up at 2330 for Anthem... hopefully I wake up on time
add me BeetRooted if any of you guys playing anthem always nice to have friends to play
My bro say come out at 11pm leh. Add him at lucas92cwk. Haha he call me to say one
"Yeah bro but doubt I’ll be able to get in at 2300 though. Had the same issues for the alpha, the VIP demo and the demo itself so I’m just gonna chill a bit. I’ll add him later!"
Anthem nice meh. Wasnt people shitting on the game's first teaser gameplay vid.
"Gameplay-wise is pretty good, in my opinion. I personally enjoyed it; it’s only the missing QOL things in the earlier playable demos that made it suck so bad."
"What do you think in comparison with Warframe and Destiny? I havent seen much gameplay vids past their first one, and all the negative (reddit) reviews isnt making things better."
"I can’t speak for Warframe because I’ve never gotten into it.Now, Anthem and D2 belong to the same genre (online shared-world looter-shooters) but are vastly different games. I play a lot of D2 myself (got my Rivensbane, Dredgen and Broadsword, to give you a rough gauge) and what I can safely tell you is that D2 is a game mainly focused about guns (fantastic gunplay) with abilities that compliment it. Anthem, however, is the complete opposite (mainly focused about abilities that are complimented by guns).They’re also very different movement-wise as well. D2 is more traditional FPS (mainly X and Y planes) while Anthem is full-blown freedom (X Y & Z). Think 3rd-person Ironman with elemental spells; that’s what Anthem essentially is.My recommendation is to go try it yourself! I myself haven’t bought the game yet; I’m subscribing to EA’s Origin Access Premier to be able to play a week earlier than the official launch. $20 as insurance for my next 500+ hour game isn’t that a big of a deal to me"
"Yeah! I will probably wait a week after the release to be on the safe side, but it does seem to have its own special touch to it. Thanks man."
"I'm just a student so pls don't flame me, but I honestly don't get why they say Singaporeans tend to work long hours OT and throughout the night.If that is the case, why is our peak hours crowded only at around 5.30pm to 6.30pm? I hardly see any white collars in the MRT anymore 8pm+ (or anyone for that matter), even in the downtown area. Doesn't that mean most workers do end their work at normal timing of 6pm or so?"
They work so hard until become like gh0st. Thats why you cnnt see.
(some) people use OT as a humble brag or it is the stupid company culture which you shouldn't stay there for long.There is a video on OT culture which is very good. Let me try and find a link for it. (cant find it. Help)
"There is a video on OT culture which is very good. Let me try and find a link for it. (cant find it. Help)The one with Indian workers is quite good. There's one guy making fun of one guy leaving on the dot ""eh bro.. half day ah? lelelel"" and kena suan for like 5-10 mins.It's in either Hindi or Tamil but there's English subtitles"

Whuttttt..groans..now i feel worse than ever
Why is voluntarily causing hurt a non-arrest-able offence?My father was punched by one malaysian in singapore. He knocked out and fell back onto the floor.Luckily there isn't any serious internal injury.But why the guy who punched my father can get away? What if next time he punches another person or even kill someone?We have to go through all the trouble to file a case now so that police will investigate.
"Grievous hurt is arrest-able though, if the punch was like those that made ur dad knock out and fell back onto the floor I’d say that’s grievous hurt?"
"Grievous hurt has a clear definition. Out of it, the police can't categorize it as arrestable either."
So what’s the clear definition?
https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871?ProvIds=P4XVI-P4_319-.
"Serious? So if someone gets into a scuffle , it’s non arrest-able?"
Yes. Shocking when I learnt.But not in the precense of police as they can then deem the fight as danger and arrest all.
Quite confused with this part
"You fight when police not around, not much they can do.But police around and you throw a punch that's different. A bit like disobey orders? Obstruction of justice, etc."
Basically grievous hurt?
"Because then your parents can be arrested for disciplining you when you were a child. - that's just one example.But it is still a criminal offence, just that under most circumstances, the police has no power to arrest him under that offence"
"I don't think any parents will punch their kids and knock them out.If they do, then I guess that's child abuse."
"But to cane, slap or spank you is causing hurt to you; they voluntarily cause hurt to you."
Alot of times the police is there to wayang nia. That time got one pervert do something to my friend report police they say no CCTV camera not working so they cannot do anything. After I posted the incident on ASS THEN they suddenly call my friend say actually the cameras working. Worse is they also interogated her like she is the criminal on why we posted the incident online.In the end also never catch the pervert. At least now I know SPF got stalked those FB pages... Maybe they lurk even in this thread.
"I think if you don't report it or make it big news, they have one less case to follow up.But I think it's just plain stupid."
Is sibeh complacent one. Even in hospitals if you dun tekan the doctor or nurse to do something they also will pretend like you immune to illness or death.
I guess it happens everywhere... not just nurse/doctor or police. They won't tell you more unless you probe further.
Pretty sure that’s assault
Nope. The police scolded him and let him off.Now we have to pay hospital bill for all the scans and hospitalisation.
"I thought can file magistrate court for like a token of $1? Then see whether the court want to charge him?""You may obtain a Magistrate’s Complaint Form by downloading it here, or collecting a hard copy from the Complaints Counter at the Community Justice Tribunals Division (CJTD) located at Level 1 of the State Courts, Havelock Square Complex. It costs $20 to file a Magistrate’s Complaint.""""For non-arrestable offences, the police will advise the victim to file a Magistrate’s Complaint if he wishes to seek redress. In rare occasions, the police will file a Complaint. Alternatively, the victim can also commence a civil suit to claim damages (compensation) for the alleged act. For example, damages may be awarded by a court to a victim of assault or battery.""Hope this help you nail the knnccb"
Yup but why do I have to go through that when the police is already there with the knnccb?Why can't they just catch him?He knocked out my father. So they will catch him if he kills someone?
Bingo

My funds are extremely low this month due to personal reasons and I'm trying to save as much as money as possible at least until the end the month so I can eat nutritionally.
The Sikh temples serve food in their communal kitchen daily. You can go there once in a while and perhaps contribute later in life when you can to the donation/charity box kept there.
Their food is pretty good too! I tried a few times already. They are also very generous with portions.
Are there any rules regarding attire? Eg do females need to cover the hair or anything like that?
"Just wear jeans is fine, footwear need take out before entering. Get a small bandana to cover your hair when entering should be fine."
http://www.nativity.sg/index.php/pastoral/soupI remember there are sikh and buddhist temples that give out free vegetarian meals also.
"Here is a long list of places that provide free meals in Singapore (Sikh temples, churches, Chinese temples and various charities)https://hubpages.com/money/Who-says-theres-no-free-lunch-in-SingaporeHope your situation gets better soon!"
Willing hearts
There's a telegram group called sg food rescue - might be useful
"Temples like Loyang Toa Peh Gong / Singapore Buddhist lodge have meals served every day. Just go get some food, no questions asked. They usually serve up the prayer offerings to the visitors.Even if you have to take away, most people would not raise an eyebrow."
Singapore Buddhist Lodge
Kong men San temples around Marymount has free food. So does the a temple near Chinatown iirc.
Swee Choon's response really warms my heart though. Way to go.
sweechoon food warm my belly also
"No excuse for this type of crap. Regardless of their views, this type of behaviour is just inexcusable and disgusting."
"While I'm disgusted with the kids, I think it's extremely awesome the sweechoon left that comment. Such a wholesome reply."
What's so hard for these morons to live and let live?
Bullies will look for any reason to put someone down to make themselves feel better. I think that’s why it’s so important to call these cowards out on it.
I am slowly realising that Singapore has it's fair share of assholes in the city
Every place has it. Not just Singapore
When their friends are around they say you're a fag dyke.But when they are alone looking in the mirror brushing their teeth at night they are so jealous it kills them inside.Don't worry about these assholes. You do you.
Jealous of what?
"Being comfortable enough with oneself to say how they really feel, rather than guffawing at recycled memes of how uptight people in the 50s thought sexuality and identity should be conformed to.And for getting heaps more sex. Obvs."
Yeah I'm pretty sure they aren't crying themselves to sleep for the aforementioned reasons. I doubt jealousy is the source of these xiaobengs' bigotry
Well we're all speculating here so no one can really be sure of anything.But the drag queen who is in drag in public has a hell lot more self confidence than guys that have to stick in packs.

your classic ah shit behaviour
"1st world country, 3rd world behavior."
Smlj. Our kids are seriously getting worse by the year
Probably learned it from the older conservatives
"Ya if you thought youths are bad, the homophobia in the baby boomer generation is off the charts"
"the attitude has pretty much always been there, the younger generation are just more outspoken with it"
"I'm 18, and I see that the kids around my age are quite accepting of LGBT people. I have had classmates who admitted they're gay/lesbian and we're all fine with it and hang out with them just like any other people. Maybe these people are older than us but I think my generation is more open minded than the one before."
"Do you usually speak English? And are you heading to university?If the answers are yes, the people you interact with are actually a pretty small part of your cohort"
You just haven't met the opposite side of people from your same age range ...
"It'a fine to have a certain view about LGBTs. It's an individual right to disagree with LGBT lifestyle, be it due to their religious or conservative attitudes.But having an opinion doesn't give anyone the right to be assholes."
Really though? As a millennial our generation is pretty bad
Whats your def of millennial first? Technically they are borned 1981-1996.
Exactly that. I think that generation (mine) is far more materialistic and worldly than the youngsters today who are actually more mature than I remembered youngsters to be.

We should look at the positivity that are the comments.
yikes its been like this since this afternoon
"Yea man, I smell it too at Woodlands."
"strong smell here too in west coast. in fact, there was a bright orange glow in the night sky"
"pasir gudang petrochemical burning. has been like this for a while now, the north east are also affected (smells damn bad on some nights)"
"Does it start in the very early mornings? I notice the smell in simei also. Different from smoke haze, it’s like some plastic kind of smell."
The fumes of Mordor.
"Can confirm from Lakeside, weirdly enough PSI isn’t so bad (at least according to NEA)"
Damn strong smell here in Boon Lay as well
"from chi garden area, can smell it"
The smells in yew tee too
Kent ridge can smell
Woke up at 4 this morning in Hillview to the smell also.Definitely different than traditional haze.
Punggol is like that close to 50% of the time.
Well our gvt has no control over this I’m afraid
I have an assumption that being a doctor is the easiest job. They can come to hospital and don’t have any job related work at home.Why does it seem that every job today requires everyone to work the all the time? It shouldn’t even be called 9-5 because they still have to continue at home. A little off topic but sometimes I wish I can live in the mountains and hunt for food myself.As for doctors they don’t have to worry how the hospital is financially and no KPI. Is that true?
Wah this is a damn insulting question lmao
"This is absolutely not true. In Singapore, doctors are one of the most overworked professions.Source: Girlfriend is a doctor.Disclaimer: This is from just my girlfriend’s work schedule alone, so feel free to weigh in on this other med students, doctors.TL:DR doctors are superhumans.My girlfriend is currently doing a posting in TTSH (for the sake of privacy i will exclude which clinic). She starts work at 9 officially, but she’s usually in by 8. Girlfriend has corrected me, she officially starts at 7 not 9. She gets off work officially at 6, but she rarely leaves before 7. During her work hours, she’s either in clinic, AnE, or carrying out ops. When she gets off work, she is either studying up on whatever field she’s currently posted in, or preparing presentations (not sure what for, other doctors can maybe help here). And all of this is on days when she is not on call.When she goes on call, she starts work just like on a regular day, -edit- except she also has to attend to call cases. She clocks out at 6pm, goes for dinner (assuming she has time to) then goes to her call room and prepares for her call. The call can go one of two ways, smooth without alot of cases, or rough with back to back ops or one long op. Depending on how understaffed the clinic/hospital is, she may have to tank some ops back go back.After her call which ends sometime in the morning (again, not sure when, other doctors can weigh in), she has to stay on in the hospital for some reason or the other, and rarely leaves before 12 in the afternoon, sometimes 4pm in the afternoon. She goes home, gets a “day off” where she usually sleeps through to the afternoon the next day, gets up, then continues studying. My girlfriend has kindly told me that she does NOT get a day off, and sometimes she doesn't even get to go 'post-call'. You were right, u/x1243.She rarely gets free time, and any free time she gets she juggles between her family, friends and I. Vacation? Better hope the guy that handles your call schedule or your leave is in a good mood, or likes you. My GF barely takes vacations, and even when she can, she very rarely manages to take a long one.It may get better as you become a senior doctor, but the starting life of a medical student/doctor is hellish, atleast from the perspective of my GF."
She gets a day off after her call? That's rare.
Don't worry. Medical school interviews are there to weed out people like you.
Who ever who ask this is damn stupid I hate it when people just think that doctors is easy money. Well from outsider perspective you be like wth go in 5 min 30$ for regular clinic 5 min for 100$ for specialist. What you don’t fking see Is the things doctors sacrifice to be a doctor. Ignorant people
"If you were to Google this, you'd find that being a doctor is much more than 'not having to work at home'. There's quite a few anecdotes/articles on the matter you can read up on.They're in charge of lives. One wrong move and their credibility is ruined. There's no time for them to browse reddit on their computers, because someone is always in need of help. And iirc, their work shifts are long and just barely have enough breaks between to keep them going. The worst experiences, I would guess, is them having to see people suffer or die on a near daily basis.Of course, some aspects may depend on what area of health the doctor specialises in, but it is not a walk in the park."
"Short answer is a resolute no. No. no. no. no. no. no.The path of med school is one - if not the most - rigourous preparation for students embarking on the life of doctor-hood. If being a doctor is not stressful enough, try enduring med school where you sacrifice all of your social life for intensive studies. Once they step out of the classroom & get into the real world, the pressure becomes 100 times tougher as they tackle with emergencies & bear with thousands of patients waiting in line for treatment each day. You really cannot underestimate the sheer dedication medics put in their profession & even if you don't see their fatigue in the clinics/hospitals they work in, chances are they are ploughing through the day/night with whatever stamina they have left to do their duties."
"Not a doctor but they have to continue studying to keep themselves updated, and some have on call duties as well. Just because they don’t worry about the hospital finances doesn’t mean they don’t have their own unique stressors. The lives of others are on their hands after all. Anyway healthcare workers got performance reviews as well."
This must be a troll post. Nobody is this oblivious. Don’t fall for trollbait.The truth is that the least stressful well paid job is to be a sidelined govt superscale officer. Get 20k monthly to shake leg and sleep.
Only people who don't know better think doctors have a chummy life. Most doctors are underpaid considering their work hours relative to the professionals in other sectors.Only the plastic surgeons and niche field doctors are raking in heavy bucks even then they have to be VERY VERY competent at what they do and the road to where they are now is nothing but arduous.
People working in the healthcare industry (including doctors) face alot of burnout dude. Don't ever judge a job from the customer/consumer's perspective.
You realize that the seniors also have to do some real work right? And they have big responsibilities. A mistake can result in a life.Other jobs many people just shake leg and act busy.
They can come to hospital and don’t have any job related work at home.This is not true. What do you think counts as 'work' for doctors? Many of them are constantly thinking about their practice and their patients even when not in the hospital/clinic.
High responsibility leh. Where got not stressful
"You make more money doing finance / IT than being a doctor. It’s possible to make a tidy pile if you open your own GP clinic but it’s a very long and tough route to get there. In summary, no it’s not an easy job for the money."

Ask him sign on if he likes fighting and weapons so much.
Or just fight legally in MMA. Can earn decent money and prove that he's a champion fighter that he think he is.
Can anyone explain why he was not tried as an adult?
"Offense committed before aged 21Edit ,or its was the decision of the Judge"
Oh i assumed the threshold was 18
You can get sent to adult prison at 16 actually. But judges usually give chance to offenders below 21 by sending them to reformative training.
What's the benefit of DB over RT?
IIRC DB usually but not always wipes record clean after NS? RT may or may not be left on history.
"I think DB longer than certain amount of time will be counted as criminal record? RT won't leave a mark, but it is probably slightly better to tell people you went DB rather than RT, since the average detainee in RT would have committed worse crimes than the average detainee in DB."
"True, and I think the figure for DB is 24 months? Can’t quite remember since it’s been a while. I also remember from somewhere that RT history can get trotted out as precedence if you have subsequent court or police cases, while DB can’t?"
"Any form of arrest by SPF is recorded in police database actually, don't actually need to step foot in any prison or RT center. And yeah your DB records are kept separate from your civilian life since it's strictly a military thing."
3 days or more willl have permanent record.
The article of course fails to explain. Yay our media sucks. I am guessing that he is under the mistaken impression that DB counts for NS time spent.
RT is so shitty that people prefer going to Prison. My guess is he thinks DB is easier than RT
"From friends who have been inside, prison > dB > rt"
Sounds like grade A human waste.
"Was looking up the judge and...Why are all the men referred to by just their names while the women are always ""Ms"" or ""Mrs"" something?"
"I suppose all men are just ""Mr"", while women may use their own name ""Ms"" or their husbands' surname ""Mrs""?(Edit: This is the use of ""Mrs"" in traditional sense. Use of ""Mrs"" with own name is becoming more common.)"
Not sure why you were down voted. This is the most logical explanation.
"It’s a double whammy because as a soldier, he’s under the jurisdiction of military court inside any MINDEF property. But outside, he can be subjected to civilian regulations. For example, if he’s caught smoking at a bus stop, NEA can fine him under the NEA Act. If he drives without a license, also prosecuted under Road Traffic Act.Mindef can still decide to prosecute him because technically, he’s a soldier under military law.The reason I say double whammy is because an SPF or SCDF can’t be prosecuted by military court, unless a policeman were to commit some kind of offence inside a Mindef property — which is something that is quite rare to occur.Personally, I feel that a military personnel should only be subjected to military prosecution. That means, any offence no matter how big or small, let the MP have full total jurisdiction.What do you think?"
"You cannot be prosecuted twice.A civilian cannot face military court even if he raped a female general in the middle of a SAF parade square after stealing a tank, a howitzer and any other hardware lying around.Military courts are found all around the World and designed to be more lenient taking into account that soldiers are trained to kill and therefore excesses are expected. Why duplicate something unless there is special need to be addressed.So no double whammy all around."
Double Jeopardy?
"Any offense tried in civil courts cannot be re-tried in military court, and vice versa."
"Actually the rule is that offences tried in civil court cannot be retried in military court, but offences tried in military court first can be retried in civil court - with the provision that the civil court may take into account the punishment already issued by military court during sentencing."
"Just like this?NSF from his criminal records, and thus allow crimes to go unrecorded in his civilian records, as ""only SAF will have your record"". “The police or courts do not have the power to take"""
"I sold a used tablet to someone on carousell. I meet up with him and allowed him to test it before handing it to him.After half a day, he messaged me back to say it ""wasn't suitable"" for him and he wanted a refund. Then he started threatening me by saying he would call the police and report me to carousell if I refused. Then he started saying the tablet was faulty.The thing is, I wasn't sure if I should refund him because he could've broken something and then tried to get his money back. I've been scammed quite a few years ago when a buyer returned something to me and it turns out he damaged it. He did the same thing, said he didn't want it, and I had to refund him or he would call the police. I agreed to refund him, and after finding out he damaged it, I tried to contact him but he ignored me. It was a small value so I didn't pursue it further. Now, I suspect this guy is trying the same stunt.I never specified in my listing that I would provide any refunds or warranty. I met up with him and let him test the tablet. I was quite confident that I'm not obliged to refund him, but now he's threatening to call the police, so I'm worried. I don't trust him enough to meet him.I don't think he will actually go to the police, but should I be worried?Thanks."
"Ignore him/Report to Carousell Support. He accepted the item as is before handing you the cash. Since both parties are agreeable as of the time of the deal, even if he regrets his purchase, you are not obligated to refund him."
"Basically, Caveat Emptor."
Him threatening to call up police is a drastic bark in anger & most likely an empty threat at safest. Stay calm & seek help from Carousell Support.
Thanks!Should I report to carousell first or wait and see if he does anything?
"No need at all. Just block him on all platforms and be done with it. Absolutely nothing the police will do about it. What he gonna tell police? ""I ask for refund he don't give?"""
Don't worry too much. There's nothing much he can do anyway if there's no hard evidence. Its his word against yours. Don't think the police will entertain this sort of crap as well. I do hope you haven't apologised to him or mentioned anything about the possibility of it being your fault over messaging though.Any conversation with him over carousell or whatsapp that e.g he thanked you for the trade or feedback left by him? If so you can save /screenshot it just to be safe.
Don’t be scared. He can call the police or Carousell but nothing’s gonna happen. You are not obligated to provide a refund.
"There's no need to be afraid. I can only suggest that you keep the carousell chat logs as well as any messages you have with him for now, just in case.He's already clearly having buyer's remorse where he said that it wasn't suitable for him. Him threatening with Police action doesn't reflect well on him either.Worst comes to worst he might want to do mediation. But I'm sure he'll be on the losing end so nothing much will come out of it. Just report to carousell support and let them handle it themselves.Source: am in SPF"
"Thanks! Should I file a complaint with spf first just in case he does? Or no need to bother, and just wait and see if he actually does anything?"
"Personally I do not feel that you have to make a report. However, if the other person threatens you or makes you feel afraid for your safety, please do make one. For now, I think the best course of option is to ignore and let the carousell staff solve the situation."
Hi Mata kor kor
"Jus keep SS of your messages. Journal your exchanges eg date and time. It is good to be noting such info for backup.I gotten a threat before. I went to the police (coz only next door to my block) and showed them. We all had a good laugh. Police asked me just file a complaint and if that fella strikes, we were ready.The fella didn’t do anything in the end"
You filed a complaint against someone on carousell? Or is this a different issue?
lmao nothing he can do to you don't worry.
"You sold the item “as is” with a no return policy. It’s buyers duty of care to test the item properly before he buys it.You don’t have to return it. Let him go to the police, you haven’t broken any laws.Also, could be a scam if he is returning a broken tablet that was not the original in the sale."
"Let me break this down for you, if he as buyer already verified during meetup and tested and both party agreed then it’s a done deal = police can’t do anything cause it’s a civil case. Only way for that guy to get his money it is to sue you or go small claim tribunal.Unless he paid you the money and you didn’t deliver the product than that’s cheating and police would be involved."
"If there's only 1 police report against you, the police won't even take action at all because you know, benefit of the doubt. Only if multiple people report you in a short period of time then will the police have a reason to take you in as a suspect. If you're honest about this, then there's nothing to fear."
ignore. even police cant do anything in this case. especially when u r doing meetup to transact
"Let him report. The police are not stupid. Provide your story to them honestly. If both of you meet up and he has already accepted it at the point of transaction, you bear no responsibility after that."
"Even if he does go to the police, they're not gonna help him. You don't need to worry about anything."
Call lor. Polis not so free to go investigate every single complain.
"Hold your ground if you have nothing to hide e.g. undisclosed defects.You met up f2f, let him test the tablet and didn't state any refund policy - as a bystander, I'd say even there is police involvement, which is unlikely, you have strong reasons not to refund citing fear that he might have intentionally damaged the product to refund.Especially if the topic of damaged product came in later during the refund conversation."
"No need to worry about it. General rule of thumb, he should have test the tablet when meeting up unless the item is like GPU, CPU, etc.Like most of the redditors said here, just keep your chat log. Its CAROUHELL, all sort of people exist there. (:"

"oh shit didnt see, but actually people also dont use over 20GB honestly"
I already subscribe to the extra 20GB for S$20 cos I use over the base amount and some times I use over 20GB when watching Dota tournaments on my phone at work. Since it auto switches over to unlimited it just means I don't have to worry about going over 20Gb (I did for Chongqing Major xd)
PepeHands
Ooh do you play DotA?? Looking for people to play with hehe.
I watch Starcraft and Dota. Sometimes too much twitch tv gets my data over loaded too.
"People use what’s within their means. If we gave you unlimited data today, you’d definitely use it to your hearts content."
"I have about 28 GB of data due to the bonuses and some months I even exceed that. Unlimited would be a godsend to me. Also great for those like me who take public transport to and from work for a total of 4 hours every workday, and use our phones for YouTube and reddit. I also use my phone as a personal hotspot occasionally so I can work on my laptop remotely."
Wait I am a retard so pls correct me if I'm wrong -With this new plan I pay $20 and get unlimited data?
"No, on top your base which is $28. So to get unlimited you just have to pay $48"
"Sigh I'm paying $45 after gst for 6gb, 150 mins and 1200 smses (stuck in a 2 yrs contract). Lol thankfully plan will expire in May. Will definitely review and jump to a good unlimited no contract plan.Thanks for clarifying!"
"Wow. That sucks. What plan is this?? I’m on an M1 plan & I pay $25.35 (including GST) for 5GB, 100 minutes (outgoing) and 100 txts."
"4G 3I think it's discontinued.Anyway, I'm not too sure is it because I got an iPhone that's why the plan is so expensive. Cause I remember when iPhone was all the hots, telcos actually created a separate pricing tier for customers looking to sign up. 🤷‍♂️PS: Paiseh it's 150 mins free. Still sian la. 😭"
"Anyway, I'm not too sure is it because I got an iPhone that's why the plan is so expensive. Cause I remember when iPhone was all the hots, telcos actually created a separate pricing tier for customers looking to sign up. 🤷‍♂️Yes, that's why. You need to see how much you save off the full iPhone price — for the $40 M1 plan it's $300, so roughly $12.50 a month is worked into your monthly plan price."
I had the same plan and recontracted earlier. They gave an additional 10GB per month for free as part of a promo. Might wanna check that out if your plan is expiring soon.
Oh interesting! My contract is on auto-renewal and is expiring in June.
"So after paying 28+20 per month, it is unlimited data, but at what speed? Do they say first X GB will be at full speed, and then slow speed of Y Mbps there after?"
"""YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE WHAT THIS TELE CO DID TO THEIR CUSTOMERS""Other companies hate them.Marketing revolutionalised."
"Not a big deal IMO, as speeds are throttled after 20GB usage."
"Just a better advertising facade.Most ""unlimited"" plans throttle you after a certain amount of data anyway. They just have a higher data cap before throttling (usually because you're paying more).1Mbps is still enough to surf websites, maybe just not stream high resolution videos."
What about games like PUBG or Brawl Stars on the throttled speed?
Should be more than enough
"as someone,who subscribe to Zero1 $14 per month for unlimited data1Mbps,you can stream unlimited YT video at 480pyou can stream gaming,from Mobile legends,to FGO,to PUBG,etc etcstreaming spotifyfacebook,google chrome,reddit,etc etconly thing that is terribly slow is downloading stuffs that is over 1GB."
So does your home internet also throttles after a certain amount?
"No, broadband here doesn't throttle unlike the US"
"And hopefully no one here don't have the stupid idea of capping our internet... Cuz boi, the backlash will be real"
But will anyone do anything about it though. Most people are just keyboard warriors and complain online just like any other issue?
"Pretty much honestly, all Singapore will do is complain, name and shame the person but no action is really done honestly..."
Though if it takes forever to load a site to complain at idk.
Wrong. Fair Usage Policy is at 100 GB per month.Edit: sorry this applies to the $3 daily unlimited.
"Wrong. According to their website:Your data will be managed after 20 GB (on top of your Base Plan) of 4G+ speeds. This is to ensure that our network remains great for everyone. Your connection will never be disconnected, so you’ll still be able to surf the internet and use your apps. This quota will be refreshed at the start of every month.If you need to be back on 4G+ speeds:Buy a Boost2) Turn your airplane mode on and off again.3) You’ll be back on high speeds and ready to go!"
Yah that's what I edited with
Important to note that the speeds are throttled after 20gb. I've been using zero1 and the throttled speeds have still allowed me to use netflix and youtube albeit at lower quality (and I'm paying $20/month in total for 15gb at unthrottled speeds).Will be interesting to see how fast/slow the throttled speeds are for circles life!
Not sure about Zero1 but Circles.Life (and M1) throttles to 1Mbps.
"1mbps for zero1 too. Slow, but won't die lah."
Not a circles life customer but this has definitely caught my attention. Well played.
I think this update broke the data usage widget on iOS?
"Yup, confirmed. Got the email from them:Remember that email we sent you about discontinuing the 20 GB for $20 Data Plus option? That was a joke. We’d never take away your data!

"This is great! I almost planned to cancel my circle life. According to some friends, the promo starts today so those already subscribed has unlimited already."
"Huh, wasn't this option already here?"
"Full speed for the original 20GB allocation, they simply removed the boosting requirement if you want to continue using data after that. Interesting though."
Not like I ever use over the original 20GB anyway lol
"YouTube on your phone every day, and always make sure to select HD."
at most 14Gb lol
Not enough youtube
"have tried, at most 18-19GB considerin i watch in camp everyday..."
I wish! I finished the 20gb at the 20th~ish of every month
what you download sia ;-)
"A few posts here saying that speeds will be throttled after 20 GB. This is not really true. Fair Usage Policy indicates throttling after 100 GB.As comparison, Singtel FUP is at 50 GB. Checkmate incumbents.Edit: 100 GB FUP per month. Once exceeded the $20 for 20 GB, you will have to pay $3 unlimited to return to fast speeds."

You require more minerals.
Upvote for the Starcraft reference.
It looks like a mistake. The column should not have coincided with the opening. Resulting in the T shaped cut-out clashing with the purer triangle tessellation of the facade. Miscoordination between facade design and transport track position .Tsk tsk tsk..... this is a side that will never be in the press photos. Sia suay.
From the picture is below a drive thru? If so then the designer have not much space and choice i suppose lol.
"The track was an existing SkyTrain track way before. When they started building Jewel, they simply stopped that service and built jewel over the track. Just so you can see the inside as the train passes through."
"Ah that makes more sense now, the detailing to resolve this should have been a little more refined though. The facade is designed by an international architect, either slipped his attention or we should start trusting in our own homegrown talent more!For example, the cutout should not be rectilinear, but triangular, or follow the module of the facade panels, so the hole looks a bit more deliberate.The coping above the opening required for water drip can be turned down to frame the whole opening instead of being just a truncated eyebrow.The opening should have some thickness with aluminium returns so it doesn’t look like a paper thin scissor-paper cut out.Just my views!"

"under engineered with alot of dead weight with fire controls that forces the user to drop your sights from your target, they know it and theyre getting rid of it for the br18, hopefully that turns out better!"
Whoa BR18.... I feel really old. I was in the army b4 SAR21.
"To be fair, when was the last time you had to switch from semi to full auto while still aiming?The weight seems manageable enough. Compared to a M4 which is way lighter, but the recoil actually is way more. So if you go burst mode also throws off aim."
Doesnt the SAR21 barely have any recoil?
"It does, but there's little to no muzzle rise. It's straight and back into the shoulder."
Hopefully the BR18 is better.
Everyone in my reservist battalion got marksman during range. A lot of us are old enough to have only used the m16 during our NSF days so we definitely loved the SAR21 cuz of the free money it gave us.
Is 100% marksmanship in ict very common?
Reshoot until pass lel. Shiok shiok.
"had a captain give his men extra rounds secretly, he got demoted a decent amount when they found out"
How to give extra rounds?The rounds is collected by the range people which is external to the unit.
"Maybe for your unit, but for us everything was in house"
"Think times have changed sia. Ours did at MMRC, so Cisco side settle all the rounds"
nope. My most recent ICT only 1/15 detail had marksmen but we had saw/m203 too. I was lucky to be in an all-SAR detail but easy to get full marks when you know your rounds per bound/target for MMRC.
We’re a combat support battalion so everyone’s using sar21 for combat shoot. The range warden set the targets to appear in a set order because....”combat support” so it became even easier for us lol.And yes - those who didn’t get marksmen on the 1st try got to reshoot until they got it hah.
"If you have pro SAW gunners mixed with a SAR team, they can actually help the rest of your detail. They're expected to fire off 3-round bursts per target, but sometimes if they're good they can control their burst and pop off 1-2 shots on their own target, then use the excess ammo to shoot across the lane on their left/right if their buddy missed. Maximum of one lane for safety though.This was for the oldschool outdoor range though, not the indoor shoots which are outsourced."
tbh I'd rather do it in MMRC than buffered range. Too fucking hot and having to wait till night - ugh.
Do you miss the M16? I was trained in both but I still prefer the M16. Maybe because of nostalgia and familiarity.
"I used the M16S1 during my NSF and only used the SAR21 for 1 day during an ICT. So I cannot really compare the two, but I can tell horror stories of the M16.During BMT, the M16 I was issued had a wobbly barrel casing. It always had wide groupings and could not be zeroed. You can argue that BMT M16 rifles are old, been passed through so many hands that they are all unreliable, but at least SAR21 is manufactured as a single solid piece. The M16S1 can be separated into 3 major pieces, barrel assembly, receiver assembly and shoulder stock. And if the tolerances of any of the 3 pieces are loose, the rifle will always be inaccurate.Again during BMT, someone thought it would be a good practical joke to steal the bolt carrier group of an M16. The practical joker separated the bolt carrier group into 7-8 individual parts and hid each part in a different location in the camp. The entire camp's personnel spent the next 12+ hours searching non-stop, without sleep. A part was found in the cookhouse rubbish bin, another was found inside a drain pipe, yet another was found under the root of a tree, you get the idea.. and some of these parts were smaller than a finger nail. At least the SAR21 only has 3 small parts that can go missing.While the M16 has an attachable scope, we are never issued with the scope. So everyone has to use the front and rear ironsights for aiming. It's not hard to learn, but for night shoots we are completely reliant on a tiny bit of promethium painted on the tip of the ironsight. And if someone's friend aka jealous armorer who don't want you to get marksman goes and paint your promethium tip with oil just one day before a night shoot... then all you see when you aim down the ironsights is total blackness. Grrr..."
The M16S1 was a cackly rifle. I still remember all the parts (especially the barrel) cackling whenever training with it.But there’s a reason why the AR-15 is still widely in use today. It’s easy to customise. It’s like the AK-47 — pa buay si.
Oh gosh the promethium ! That brings back a lot of memories.
"It can shoot much better and easily maintain but lost out to M16 in terms of ergonomic. The cross bolt safety, position of fire selector, pulling of charging handle instead of bolt release button all felt quite weird"
Making her a meganekko was a mistake
Why though? I thought it was quite apt given the SAR’s scope.
Probably but I guess I'm just personally not a fan of glasses girls
"In Upotte - the manga that this game is based off on, all rifles with scopes as standard (and cannot be removed) are glasses girls. See: Aug, that has a scope you can't remove, and Sig 550, that at the beginning had a scope but later on didn't have one. :3 There is only one exception, although she's depicted as extremely clumsy."
"Hang on, GFL is based off Upotte?I thought they were akin to what Azur Lane is to Kancolle - a Chinese-inspired counterpart that got significantly popular over their Japanese peers because they did the smart thing and made it accessible beyond the Japanese audience."
"Yeah - I meant ""inspired"". And the only reason why GFL happens to be more well known here is that GFL had a mobile game. Upotte never had a game, it was one of those personification things that's in the same category as things like Afghanisu-Tan in the day."
literally making the sar21 your wife waifu
raifu
"I liked it. More than the M16s the air force still uses.It's shorter and more convenient in tight spaces (e.g. vehicles)The scope is really foolproof. You aim where, 80-90% of the time it hits there.The scope handle is more ergonomic. Got rubber grip somemore.That and the M16s are alr fking old and not in a good state. I recall once I had to use 1 that was practically stained green from all the camo cream from our forefathers face."
That and the M16s are alr fking old and not in a good state. I recall once I had to use 1 that was practically stained green from all the camo cream from our forefathers face.I remember being issued a M16 for my range and it jammed for every second shot I fired. Somehow the bullets were not getting fed properly. I had to cock it every time I make my shot.
"Wow, it became bolt action!"
"The M16s that we used were so abused it’s no wonder they kept on IA. Makes me wonder... they say that in war, we have all these brand new assault rifles in storage. Mindef surely thought long term, so they must have procured/stored a bunch of these during the 80/90s.Then when we moved to the SAR21, the same rumour goes that we have brand new 21s if shit hits the fan.But... whatever happened to our almost like new M16? Did we sell them to another country? Hmm..."
"you have to separate maintenance and design because if we left it at that, we'd be talking about every little piece of broken equipment in the saf"
"Yea, that's why its more of an afterthought than in my list of reasons.shudders at thoughts of broken equipments/parts that need to be repaired/re-indented"
"Can't use left handed because of the inadequate shell deflector, forcing left handers to re-train."
"I've been told that the deflectors work fine, and that there's no issue shooting it left handed.The problem is that they inserted a piece of Kevlar on the left side of the ejection port so that chamber explosions won't harm a right handed user, but if you're left handed... oof."
"Ccb we were trained to fire with right and they always say what if casing hits your face? I said that's what the round defector is for, they replied saying so many lefty use right hand no problems, you also won't have problems.Main issue is I'm left master eye and can't close it to aim. So I aim with both eye open, which takes longer to acquire target and focus.Why can't they make it ambidextrous like a European bullpup that uses a removable plate to eject rounds the correct side"
Does it really matter though? I’m right handed and I switch to left handed shooting from time to time and I can’t feel much of a difference
"For newer soldiers I guess not. But I'm left handed with a right master eye. Trained M16 in BMT (old soldier) then had to retrain in OCS because they changed to the SAR. That to me is a design flaw. Now as an NS man, AI drills can be tricky since I touch the rifle only once every few years."
"I trained with the M16, M16+M203, SAW, and SAR21I love the SAR21 but fuck the Matador."
"Sorry, never had army time.Could you elaborate on the Matador?"
"It's a section level light anti-vehicle/structure weapon that replaced the armbrust. It's like a 9kg bazooka that you have to carry in addition to your 4kg rifle. The dummy is probably heavier.Operations wise its fire and forget. Training wise its heavy and you have to bring it every where. It ""strangles"" whoever is carrying it coz usually you kinda half sling it around your neck.It's best purpose is as smth to sit on when your superiors and trainers aren't looking ."
The dummy is definitely heavier
"With the SAR21, getting marksman at 100m is more of a formality than a significant effort."
Best waifu 😍😘
It gets hotter when you fire it.
"AbudenAs long as you don't touch anywhere near barrel or gas regulator, you are fine. The only gun I know that doesn't get hot after firing it is probably a water gun."
It's a joke

Prefer the SAR. Guess it's because of my smaller stature.
Prefer the SAR-21 when firing but prefer the M-16 when doing guard duty :X
I prefer hk416.

My friend sent me some pictures of the fence being placed. Anyway Lee Bee Wah posted that the jetty had been cordoned off. Perhaps you're right and it could have been from long ago

Singapore has way too many fences already. The other day I was at Promenade area and most of the roads there have temporary fences up. My goodness. Freaking ugly. People can't cross the road without killing themselves?
"To think the founder guy so satki in his swanky hq Office in Shanghai last year but now no more business. Every employee looked elite and had cool workstations but I guess such is the life of startups, looks can be deceiving."
I doubt ofo will bother removing their bikes. They've already pretty much fled the country.
"Agreed. The founders are from China, so if they pack up and chabo, what can we do? At the most they don’t show face in Singapore again, and LTA is left to pick up their mess, literally."
And guess who pays for LTA? Us.
"Well I guess we did have to pay for all those free rides they gave out at the start. Just that we are paying for it in another way, through taxes."

"Didn’t ofo alr say they have no more staff in the country already? They pretty much said “do what you want w my stuff, I don’t care. byeeeeee”"
"SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has suspended Chinese bike-sharing company ofo's operating licence in Singapore, it said on Thursday (Feb 14). ""Despite previous communications with ofo to comply with the regulatory requirements by Feb 13, 2019, ofo has failed to comply with these requirements, including proper implementation of the QR code system,"" said LTA. The authority said that ofo will be required to remove all their bicycles from public places by Mar 13. The suspension will only be lifted if the company meets all regulatory requirements, LTA said, adding that it will continue to monitor the company's efforts to comply and may cancel its licence if does not show satisfactory progress.Read more at https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ofo-lta-suspends-operating-licence-february-14-bike-sharing-11242812"
just a little bit late to the party LTA. 3 months too late
Obike is dead! Long live Ofo!Ofo is dead! Long live Mobike!
"In the end, maybe there is room for 1 operator. Hopefully they will survive."
No wonder my Lazada Liveup's infopage says the ofo benefits will cease on 15 Feb even before this news came out. Hmmm.
Wonder what’s the next replacement
When is mobike's turn?
"Dont think anytime soon. They probably be able to monopolise the industry since their 2 biggest competitor obike and ofo are now gone.The rest like sgbike, anywheel have smaller fleet and market share."
"Mobike's doing fine. The bike limit has made it a pain to look for one of their bikes at times, but otherwise they mostly work."
Why LTA removing ofo bikes ? Is it because it's Chinese ?

Hope it was just an electrical fire and nthg more.

"Why would you want to go to Malaysia? Didn't you watch Mad Max? When a white guy tried to journey in a wasteland?Once you cross the checkpoint, they assault your noses with their black herbal bak kut teh and openly display their chewing gum to mock us. No Singaporean would regularly cross the border, to just purchase their food, cheaper medication and shopping needs.Better yet, do not consider taking a trip to historical location of Melaka during this period, when the authorities close streets and line them with wide variety of street food and cuisine, in a cruel attempt to outshine our own Chinatown district. This place do not deserve the nickname ""The Venice of the East"". Is a chaotic mess of Dutch, Portuguese, Malay, Indian and Chinese culture mixed together.Penang is like the Alcatraz of Malaysia, their pearly white sandy beaches is no match for our murky water of East Coast Park. The government blackmail UNESCO to award them World Cultural Heritage Site. Do not try to explore and try their street food, as hawkers coated them with drugs to make you crave for them.Stay in our tiny island, all the countries in Malay Archipelago took hundreds of years to just develop their culture, when we took 50 years. Is fake news when you hear locals often go Johor, Kuala Lumpur or Bali for diving, shopping and sightseeing activities. They are just secret operatives. In fact, do not travel at all, Singapore is incredibly self-reliance and our neighbors has never made any strong cultural or historical impacts on us."
Quality shitpost
"For a beginner preview to Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur is one of them. Penang and Malacca, smaller towns with rich culture and good food. Tioman Island if you like beaches, Cameron Highlands if you want to escape tropical heat (but weekend crowds may spoil the fun)."
"I'd say go to Melaka. It's only a few hours away. The food there is amazing. Great weather, history, sightseeing."
Great weatherOn top of the hill yes. Everywhere else I actually find it hotter than Singapore without the trees.
I like sunny weather :D
"Haha, wait what!? When did you go? I don't recall seeing any flies, big or small, when I went."
"Really? Malaysia has flies, but generally not in urban areas."
Try going Tioman Island. Beautiful place.
"Depends what you're looking for but for a tourist, KL isn't that dangerous."
This OP is just a troll
It's not much more conservative as you imagine. It's just like any other cities in the world. It's not as safe as Singapore but not any more dangerous than say Europe cities with their pickpockets and purse snatchers. There are many none Muslims too and tourism is an important revenue for the country so they will accommodate foreigners well.
Its a weird perception most people have but Malaysia is definitely one the safer countries in the world.
Send them to our waters off Tuas to help give directions to Malaysian ships and Chief Ministers who can’t read maps
Did you know that even google maps display different variants depending on where are you from? Border disputes have always been a thing in human history
"This sounds more like a fiction. We all want to hear this kind of story, but is it realistic? On top of racing with the curriculum requirements, endless meeting, office politics, lack of support from the parents, the teacher are expected to be a hero/role model from the students.Even if this story is not a fiction, this is definitely an outlier example. Not all teachers are capable to reach out to students, not all students can be reached out, and more importantly, i doubt MoE prepare the teachers to solve this kind of issue.Every kids is unique and in a class size of 40 students, there are 40 problems. The school institution alone wont be able to handle this problem, and iirc, moe did less to empower the teacher."
reads like a puff piece trying to attract more people to get jobs under the moe tbh
"I share your views. If the focus shifts from educating to other areas, students who are committed, turn up each day, complete their homework will suffer and no human being can take on 2 important roles simultaneously.Teachers can help detect issues or note early signals and refer the right parties to intervene. I see teachers carry their work home that alone shows that the day is always long. You cannot intervene in a student’s personal crisis and stop midway.Teachers who excel must be recognised for ability to educate, encourage students to excel academically and create the right atmosphere to learn. Some of them are hard on their pupils but it is done with sincerity. I dread if the teacher is seen as someone friend or mentor for reasons other than in the field of education."

"How a Singapore teacher won over her classIn the weeks leading to Chinese New Year, social media was ablaze with a story about a teacher’s online rant about the lack of parental involvement in their children’s education.While she was widely panned for her post, including drawing the ire of the Ministry of Education, what she said resonated with me as a fellow-educator because it spoke to the deep frustrations that teachers face. (Needless to say, she has since resigned as an adjunct teacher.)This story was very much in my mind during a Chinese New Year visit, when I happened to sit down to chat with someone connected to me in the most tenuous of ways. Serendipitously, I found out that she had been a teacher, among the many things she had done.Now, conversations during Chinese New Year visits are rarely deep, much less scintillating. This is especially so when you are seated with folks you rarely see as a matter of course. Intrigued, I pressed her to share anecdotes from her teaching days.This occurred about three to four years ago. After making a mid-career switch to teaching, she was first sent to a neighbourhood secondary school.The kind of school where you, the newbie (especially female) teacher, are told on your first day when you set foot in class that you will probably be crying by dismissal. Told by the class, that is. Because all the others did.Nonplussed and hard-nosed,  she retorted: “Let's see who cries first, ok?”Nothing in teacher training really prepares you for this. Before you get to showcase your mastery of pedagogy and content, you have to make a connection.But how do you reach out to kids who are cynical, suspicious, disengaged, and who think they have been given up on already?Absenteeism and discipline issues are par for the course. Quite a few are from dysfunctional families. Some are mixed up with gangs.At this point, you realise that you have to put aside all books, and just get to know them.Easier said than done. You do so by yourself first coming from generosity and vulnerability, and baring something of yourself.You share your own failures and mistakes, for example. But you have to take care that it is not condescending and contrived. Many of these kids have come to develop a highly-refined ability to detect insincerity.You reach out your hand, get it bitten, and reach it out again anyway. You get past the sneers and the scowls, the cursing and swearing, the posturing and the swagger, and you learn to read their lives.You see who wears his or her hair down one day to hide a black eye. You notice who never ever eats anything during recess, so you can bring sandwiches and snacks from home.You find out quickly who has a change of clothes in their bags because they've got jobs they need to be at after school.Bit by bit, the ice thaws and the masks crack.And the little, hard-won victories come, if they come: those habitually absent start showing up, chronic latecomers show up a little less late, a hint of a smile, a glimmer of understanding. A human connection.This reminded me of the work of Father Greg Boyle, founder and director of Homeboy Industries, a social enterprise right in the heart of the greatest concentration of gangs in Los Angeles.Homeboy Industries provides rehabilitation, counselling, training, jobs and tattoo removals for the most hardened gang members.It then struck me that the heart of teaching, as Father Boyle says, consists of telling our students — all our students — that they are much more than the worst thing they have ever done.And some kids desperately need to hear it. But we need to say it, no matter how tough a slog it might be to get to the point where we can say it authentically.One time, my friend fell badly ill and was absent from school for weeks. She was completely homebound.One day when she finally felt well enough to take a walk in her neighbourhood, she saw her students skulking around her estate, furtively darting around the void decks, furiously going around the different carparks.“’Cher, ’cher, we came to look for you. You so long never come school, we all worried. Are you ok? When are you coming back?”The school office would not tell her students her address. But they knew roughly where she lived, knew her car license number, and so spent days tracking her down.For a teacher, this is validation, no matter if you seek it or not.For the lives that are touched, this is world changing. Not “the” world, but their world. Now how’s that for a KPI?There is no public policy lesson here, at least not any I intended. Nor any deep philosophical point.Here’s just a story I was privileged to hear, one which I think is important to share.I’m sure it is just one of the many stories about our teachers out there.But as the poet Alvin Pang is fond of saying, the small picture is the big picture.

Hello 5th floor neighbors. 4th floor checking in

Finally some free sms! I only send 1-3 sms a month but it's kinda annoying to see my bill at $28.05 every time.
"They removed the 2Gb port-in bonus and allowed everyone to get 6Gb in the base plan. This meant those who are current subscribers who did not port-in are now 2Gb behind the rest of the new subscribers. Instead of the port-in bonus, it now offers $60 cashback of bills. Unlimited Whatsapp Voice calls are now limited to 10K min/month."
Thanks for informing! It’s rly 25 sms and 100 mins talk time but my port in 2gb bonus is still around.
I still got my 1gb port in bonus though? I think my other one expired.
Thanks for the heads up. They somehow set my SMS to 50 when it was 25. Adjusted back to 25. $1 saved lol

"Hi! I'm reaching out to you guys as I've recently been dealing with some problems and I don't know what to do. Simply put, i think i may have depression and anxiety but I have not been officially diagnosed, and don't know if I should see a doctor about it. I've been going through quite a bit, though I'm only 19, and I honestly thought about killing myself last night (definitely not the first time). This isn't something I can tell my parents as I know they wouldn't understand and they'd just feel hurt. I've been self harming for a few years now and it's honestly become something of an addiction.My main question is, what should I do? I'll be entering the army soon, and I'm quite certain I'd be sent to the counsellor due to my scars. The problem is, I really don't want anything to go on record, but I think I've come to the realisation that I might actually need help. Any form of help would truly be appreciated"
"Don't. kill. yourself. I repeat: Do not seppuku.Thoughts of self-harm & suicide are not things to be taken lightly, but voicing your need for help here is half the battle the won against what you face in life. You can try booking an appointment at CHAT@ Scape where you can get a free assesment by qualified psychs & social workers, or go to your nearest polyclinic. Either channel you go to, the professionals are bound by ethical responsibility to keep your condition strictly confidential. In regards to NS enlistment, it is best for you to declare your condition first before Army Life starts so SAF may know how to best assist to your needs. Know that you never struggle alone, there will be people to help you along :) Take care & stay strong 💪🏻"
Thank you! I’ve never heard about CHAT before and I guess I’ll have a look. Thanks so much for the words of encouragement
"Yes, much better to commit sudoku instead. Sharpens the mind and relieves stress."
"You just took the first step to getting better. There’s some great advice on here already so I’m just going to echo what everyone else is saying; go see a professional and get help.Someone very close to me was in the exact same situation as you once. She gradually was getting worse and worse, until she opened up about it and got help. Now they are happy and healthy and have been without issues for a long time. It is definitely possible.It can be a slow road back to feeling normal but you just need to stay on track and you’ll get there.Good luck buddy. Face your issues front on and get well soon."
Thank you!
"Man, dude I wanted to end it all so many times when I was younger.But I love my life now. Things can get better, but you've got to make it through this. You've made it this far, so I'm sure you've got this."
Glad to hear that you’re feeling much better now! Thanks for this
Thank you... I did think of calling the first number last night and thought about it for a while but ended up not doing as I felt that maybe I could somehow handle it myself
"If u think u are facing issues, please do not hesitate to find help. Medical professionals are obliged to keep patient records confidential. In NS, as well, do not worry and let them know. It'll be better than half way through bmt u suddenly can't take it and spiral out of control."
"Okay, thank you!"
"You need to confide in someone, either a social worker (at Samaritans, maybe) or a doctor. If you see a doctor you can request for anti-depressants. The doctor would likely provide a very limited quantity to last perhaps up to a week, and so you should also ask for a referral to a psychiatrist who would be in a better position to justify providing you with the required amount of medication plus deciding on what further treatment you require. Your visits to the doctors are confidential, and so you need not worry about a record. It would be up to you whether you wish to disclose your psychological issues when you get called up for enlistment. I would suggest it would be best for you to do so. Years from now you will likely look back on this period as a learning experience on how to deal with stress and other difficult issues. Do take heart that your current struggle is not unusual among your peers. All the best and take care."
"Thank you! I’ll consider seeing a doctor, and I think I’ll tell those at MINDEF about what I’m going through"
"Dude im sorry for everything that you've been through lately. I can only imagine how hard it is for you since i've never been through bad episodes of depression and anxiety. Having said that, I believe that having a positive mindset can greatly help you reduce the stress you're gg thru. Maybe listen to some asmr or do some yoga? Exercising can also boost your mood and make you feel better about yourself as it helps to release endorphins.To me, the most important thing that could help you through this is to talk to someone you trust about your issues right now and is willing to help you in any way they can. It helps to release the emotional buildup and it also allows you to freely express yourself without being judged. It truly sucks to be depressed, I may not be one who suffers from it but i do have friends who do, and it honestly hurts me to see them in pain due to it. I sincerely hope that you take care of yourself and dont be afraid to seek help should you need to.You're still young and you have a life to live, dont waste this chance!! Live your life to the fullest and always see things in a positive light, even if the situation at hand is vv dire. I wish you all the best and I hope that you are able to overcome your personal struggles and live a happy life! :)"
"Thank you :) Positivity really hasn’t been my thing all my life, mainly because I’d always get disappointed whenever I had my hopes up, which led me to just have low expectations and all.I’ve honestly never tried asmr or yoga so I may give it a go, but as for exercise, I’ve done it all my life, played sports for my school as well and it was one of the reasons why I got so stressed out - due to season ending injuries and not meeting expectations"
"Erm, yes, it certainly sounds like you need professional medical help. Any form of medical help will leave a record, even private ones. Confidentiality is kept dead serious - even if you go IMH, civil service will not have access to it if next time you wanna work for G.The quickest way is to go to polyclinic and ask for a referral to IMH or govt hospital psych ward. From there you will be referred to see a specialist to understand your problems better. Since you are 20, you can also go to CHAT at SCAPE Orchard to seek primary assistance and a referral to IMH. Mental health issues usually are tackled by a combination of meds and counselling.And during your pre-enlistment screening, please do declare your condition and that you are due/seen by a specialist. No point going to a vocation you cannot manage.Please keep yourself safe while all these happenSOS (Samaritans of Singapore) - 24/7 hotline 1800 221 4444 - call if suicidal thoughts. If not can always call ambulance 995 - you will be sent to the nearest A&E.Take care, and all the best."
"Confidentiality is kept dead serious - even if you go IMH, civil service will not have access to it if next time you wanna work for G.They can compel you to reveal your medical history if your PES status isn't A or B if they really want to know. Don't even need to access your medical records. Only in private sector can you avoid the topic of NS by leaving it out of your resume completely."
I guess right now I’ll just tell whoever I speak to everything I’m going through and whatever they need to know
"Thank you! Someone else did mention CHAT so I’ll go find out more about it, but thank you again!"
Go to a psychologist and get him to prescribe Xanax. Quick fix. Some chemical reaction removes anxiety instantly and depression. Then you can slowly resolve your issues with a clear head. Help me greatly when I was at the bottom and suicidal. Instantly took the negative feelings away within 5 min. Gave me space and a straight head to go through things properly. The psychological evaluation would be very helpful during NS so really go do it.
Xanax is great but not a long term solution
"Agreed. But it does provide a moment of clarity if you have been stumbling in the mud for a long time. It’s not a solution but it provides much needed breathing space. With the self harm and suicidal tendencies, I would recommend it in this case. There are a few types, fast acting, slow release type and another that helps you sleep. I was on all three. The first one only for emergencies, the other two had to take daily for about a year. Once I sorted my shit out I didn’t need it anymore. But it’s the reason why I’m still about to see the sun every morning."
Holy shit a year of daily use? No withdrawals?
"I took at everyday for about 9 months then weaned off it the last 3 months. Always follow doctor's instructions, they are there to help. Always take prescribed doses, nothing more nothing less. Zero alcohol, can be fatal."
"What was the daily dose, if I may ask? And are there lasting effects after weaning off, like poorer memory? Or positive ones?"
"Can't remember definitely but I think it was 0.5mg per dose. 2 pills in the morning, the slow acting one and another as a counter to any side effects. Then 3 pills at night, can't remember what they are called but it helped me sleep. Before that I was only clocking 3 to 4 hours a night and had to drink myself to sleep. On bad nights I can go sleepless the whole night even after a bottle of whiskey. The other pill was the 5 min fast acting one for panic attacks. Memory affected only dosing the panic attack ones which were few and far between. But I do feel ""emotionally numb"" the first few weeks which was a huge relief. No depression or anxiety but you don't really feel happy or excited. Heart beat became extremely regular and calm. Weaning was no problem and I was doing regular exercise so that helped. I quit my stressful job and found a nice 9 to 5 one. Quit drinking too along the way. So all in all best possible outcome I suppose Lasting effects probably is I'm can identify when I am becoming agitated and try to avoid it and can detach myself from my emotions better by remembering the feeling of ""emotional numbness"". Lost a few drinking friends along the way, lost my high income job but better balance in life I guess."
"Thanks for sharing, nice to hear you're doing better. I probably need psychiatric help too but I'm don't currently have a regular income so can't afford the high costs of (private) mental healthcare. And there are all sorts of obvious reasons why IMH should be avoided in most cases. It's quite baffling really that psychiatric/psychological help costs so much when the people who need it the most probably can't even function well enough to be productive members of society, to work and be able to afford it 🤔"
"At an international conference in Budapest organised by the Central Bank of Hungary last week, there was an intense debate among participants on the effective role of central banks.Singapore was repeatedly identified as an exemplary model where the central bank and the government have consistently done well in crisis management.The discussion of the Singapore model among central bankers was dominated by how Singapore effectively managed crises, leading to a swift rebound from every economic recession or slowdown. However, I thought the debate largely missed the point - the severity of the crisis in the first place was mitigated, due largely to strong and stable macroeconomic fundamentals and efficient resource allocation for firms and individuals within the micro-economic environment.PREVENTION RATHER THAN CURESingapore's fundamental strategy in effective crisis management is rooted in preventive and pre-emptive moves, rather than cures. The recent prudent regulations on property purchases, sales and bank-related borrowings, coupled with pre-emptive market cooling measures, are just a case in point.As a small and open economy, Singapore's macroeconomic condition is constantly and strongly influenced by external factors. These include business cycles, financial turmoil and tumultuous political changes coming from Asian neighbours, or economic volatility transmitted from Western economies in an inter-connected and inter-dependent world.Despite these volatile factors, Singapore has remained competitive, staying ahead of the curve in global trade and investments. It is able to do so by seizing opportunities and making itself relevant in the face of changes.Singapore's longer-term survival rests upon its continuing to actively pursue globalisation under the World Trade Organisation.FREE TRADE AND GLOBAL OPPORTUNITIESWhen Singapore was the rotating chairman of Asean last year, regional Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership were given a further push for the last mile of completion. Singapore's consistent support for the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is clearly stated; in fact, it first founded TPP together with three other member countries.It would not be surprising if early exploration and preparation for a bilateral FTA between Singapore and the United Kingdom is already being contemplated by senior civil servants before Brexit comes into effect. Singapore's unrelenting leadership in FTA for greater economic connectivity and regional integration is widely recognised."
"In 2017, Singapore for the first time rose to become the third most competitive financial centre in the world, after London and New York, overtaking Hong Kong from fourth position, according to a London-based think-tank.Thus, establishing Singapore as an infrastructure evaluation, arbitration, investment and financing hub in Asia and promoting internationalisation of the yuan are simply part of new opportunities that have surfaced under the Belt and Road Initiative which it must quickly seize upon.Urbanisation is the next phase of development for China and India, and the growth of their middle class is powering their domestic consumption.Singapore's businesses and government-linked companies must gain deeper footholds in their urbanisation drive by setting new standards. As a city-state, we have the advantage of providing comprehensive smart urban solutions.And for the expanding middle class, which possesses strong purchasing power, Singapore as a cosmopolitan city offers an attractive modern lifestyle. This is highlighted by several international studies that have ranked Singapore very highly in terms of e-commerce, digitalisation and city liveability.FIRM HOME FOUNDATIONS: THREE COMPONENTSTo seize opportunities arising from new development trends globally, there must first be a conducive business environment and a competitive corporate tax structure at home; these are vital for small and medium-sized enterprises to build strong foundations and prepare to venture abroad.Good fiscal discipline with forward-looking budgetary planning, and ensuring general price and exchange rate stability at home are important too as ""safety buffers"", enabling companies to better cope with the next economic downturn or financial crisis. They are preventive measures critical for healthy and robust business expansion. Second, efficient allocation of government resources for provision of public goods and services, transparency of regulations, good governance and firm rule of law at the micro-economic level are the sine qua non of incentivising businesses and individuals to realise or maximise their potential economic contributions.Together, these provide the strong foundations that are necessary for the economy if our longer-term average growth in gross domestic product (GDP) is to stay at the higher band of 3 to 5 per cent per annum, which would also mean more job choices for citizens.Third, whether it is soft capacity building by investing in people or building hard physical infrastructure, both are critical in maintaining Singapore's international competitiveness. Markets often fail when it comes to capacity building and skill upgrading. Government must thus act as a market enabler.In an era of rapid technological and digital advancement, transformation of companies can be difficult in terms of management, marketing and manpower adjustments.Multi-stakeholder-driven Industry Transformation Maps involving major industry players, unionists, business professionals, academics and the Government would be more appropriate, rather than leaving it to the more painful creative destruction by market forces for adjustments.GROWTH AND REVENUE OUTLOOKFrom 2011 to last year, Singapore's annual GDP grew at an average of 3.7 per cent. Over the same period, the average annual productivity growth was 1.26 per cent.Looking ahead, the econometric model simulation by the Asia Competitiveness Institute at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, relying on several assumptions, including labour-capital quality growth and one per cent employment growth, projects that for the economy to grow at 2.79 per cent, Singapore's productivity growth would have to be at 1.79 per cent per annum.The productivity growth last year was around 2.6 per cent and is expected to improve gradually.When preparing a national budget, the finance minister would usually examine the forecast GDP growth, look at the estimated government revenues versus government expenditures and, in the case of Singapore over the last two decades, factor in the amount of Net Investment Income (NII) that can fortunately be drawn upon to help in the event of budgetary shortfalls.Contributions of NII to the Budget have gone up over the years, from an average $2.72 billion per year over the 2000-2008 period to nearly tripling to $8.13 billion per year between 2009 and 2015, and almost doubling to $14.94 billion per year from 2016 to 2018.The NII contributions have risen over time, especially since 2009, in large part to rein in and mitigate the effects of rising income disparity. Special Transfers were made to provide extra funding for essential public services, including healthcare, transportation, housing and education.As our population ages rapidly, more financial resources will be needed for healthcare and benefit-linked packages such as the Pioneer Generation and the forthcoming Merdeka Generation.Given the challenges posed by the digital economy and the high value-added, skill-driven economy, pressure for greater public funding for various productivity improvement and skills training programmes is also expected to rise. Public investment in quality education from infancy, life-long learning and targeted skills-driven growth are critical as part of overall efforts to reduce income disparity and ensure a more inclusive society in the long term.Money also needs to be set aside for growing infrastructure demands. For instance, airport and sea port expansion will be needed if Singapore is to remain a major logistics hub in Asia.In the uncertain years ahead, what if Temasek Holdings and GIC fail to deliver expected profits, of which 50 per cent must be locked in the national coffers, to provide the funding for these expected additional demands on the Budget?"
"TRADE PROTECTIONISMTrade protectionism and nationalist muscle-flexing are on the rise worldwide, including in our neighbourhood. The threat of terrorism remains while technology-driven disruption has sown job and economic uncertainty. These developments and trends are unlikely to go away in the medium term.Singapore has done well thus far with its pre-emptive strategy in economic management. Faced with these rising challenges, a forward-looking Budget ought to strengthen our foundations for delivering macroeconomic stability as well as set aside ample financial resources that will, with policy-restructuring measures, continue to provide micro-economic efficiency and soft-and hard-capacity building.However, the public at large and the business community would need clear assurances from the Government and the finance minister, in particular, on whether Singapore will have, in time to come, sufficient financial resources to respond nimbly and appropriately to the potential disruptions and challenges on the horizon.• Tan Khee Giap is co-director, Asia Competitiveness Institute at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore; and Tan Yan Yi is a Singapore full-time national serviceman.

"The Singapore Nuclear Research and Safety Initiative (SNRSI) was setup up to train experts in nuclear research but only Nuclear Fission research is supported. Nuclear fusion - which is what goes on in the sun and involves combining atoms as opposed to splitting atoms as in fission - is not supported.The way I see it, there are currently 2 sources of backbone power: fossil fuel and nuclear fission. Current estimates of fossil fuels puts us at roughly 50, 50, 100 years reserve for natural gas, oil and coal respectively at our current rate of usage [1]. Before we even reach 50 years, oil and natural gas will likely be too expensive for us to afford. Coal is too dirty and harder to transport from the place it was mined to Singapore. Even if new sources of fossil fuels were found, it is not an ideal source of energy due to its impact on the environment.Nuclear fission on the other hand has a bad reputation. Coupled with the small land area of Singapore, it will be hard for Singaporeans to accept even if reactors become significantly safer. No doubt, we still need to groom experts in fission given our neighboring countries' interest in them eg. Vietnam.Renewable/Green energy like solar seem unlikely to be anything but a supplementary source of power given the high cloud cover year round. Wind, tidal, hydroelectric are all not options for Singapore.Having said all these, we definitely need a new source of backbone power. The notion that ""fusion is always 50 years into the future"" is a misconception. The rate of fusion progress (triple product) has been advancing faster than Moore's Law [2]. At this rate, current estimates are that commercial power from fusion reactors will be ready in 30-40 years time, which is just about in time before fossil fuels run out. Once industry gets serious about fusion, progress will be rapid. Who knows, this estimate might even go down. In fact, the U.S  National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine published a report in December 2018 urging the U.S that ""Now is the right time for the U.S to benefit from the investments in burning plasma research and take leadership in fusion energy."" [3]. They were referring to their investments in a nuclear fusion reactor experiment named ITER that involves many major countries like the U.S, China, Russia, Japan, Korea, India and the EU. Fusion is not a pipe dream.From the SNRSI webpage, the purpose of the scholarship is to train experts in nuclear research. We could wait till fusion is much more proven before sending scholars to study it but I would hardly consider a PhD graduate to be an expert in his field. In 30-40 years time, scholars who have begun their PhD in fusion now would truly be an expert in their field. Even if Singapore decides then not to use fusion power, it can be certain that neighboring countries will adopt this source of energy and we will still need experts in fusion. In addition, knowledge and insights gained from the study of plasma and other fusion technologies can be used to spawn new technologies in other fields (eg. medical equipment).My question is when fossil fuels run out (something which will happen for the age group of people using reddit), what are we gonna do? What's Singapore plan? We plan to be fully self-sustained in water supply through the use of water catchments, recycling of water and desalination. But desalination also requires a lot of energy. Isn't this a threat to our water needs too? More importantly, how are we going to keep browsing Reddit when we have no more power? Shouldn't we at least start looking at fusion as a source of energy?tl;dr : Fossil fuels are running out, nuclear fission plants have bad rep, solar can only supplement our energy needs. Yet Singapore isn't looking into Nuclear Fusion. How exactly are we going to meet our energy demands in 50 years time?References:[1] https://ourworldindata.org/how-long-before-we-run-out-of-fossil-fuels[2] https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-fusion-energy-in-our-future/[3] https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25331/final-report-of-the-committee-on-a-strategic-plan-for-us-burning-plasma-research"
"No one is stopping you from studying overseas to become an expert in Nuclear Fusion. You're salty that there's no scholarship for this. But there aren't scholarships or local degree programmes for many niche subjects. For example, until last year, there was no way to study to become a vet locally, and there's a much bigger demand for vets than nuclear fusion experts in Singapore.Singapore isn't against nuclear power. It says on the SNRSI web site:"" Singapore has announced in parliament in October 2012 that it will not pursue nuclear power at this juncture with current NPP technology. It will wait for NPP technology and safety to improve further before reconsidering this option. However, Singapore needs to strengthen its capabilities to understand nuclear science and technology, in order to assess the implications for Singapore of evolving nuclear energy technologies and regional nuclear energy developments. ""So I'm sure they would be very happy if you could study nuclear fusion and bring that expertise back. They just have a certain budget and decided not to give a scholarship in this area, because it's not close to practical application yet. It's blue sky research, and you will find that across all kinds of fields (e.g. biology), Singapore doesn't give a lot of monetary support towards blue sky research."
""
"Singapore does not need to be first. It does not even need to be second. It just needs to be the best. Singapore currently also have a lot of vested interests in oil and gas. Should Fusion be a real thing, I won’t be surprised if we go with a private-public partnership strategy. With opening up the electricity market, we are prime to take advantage of any new source of electricity. Any electricity company will be tempted to provide that for Singapore."
"after the oil/gas the whole of jurong island becomes available, that's 5x size of sentosa, but thats probably at least 50years in the future."
"I think u provided a really good insight for people who are out of loop on this issue.Firstly, i just want to say that ALL renewable energy be it solar or wind requires energy and resources to build the device. What i meant was you need energy to produce the material to build a solar panel, so no renewable energy is “clean”.Nuclear energy is a really sensitive topic to conduct research on, because the country that is most advance in nuclear energy will have an advantage in war. So while studying nuclear energy is logically the right path for human race, it is politically wrong to study it.Honestly, i dont recall Singapore being the leader in developing any engineering feat. Research require huge capital."
"We don't have the horizontal land space to accommodate solar.It could be obtained from leased land in Malaysia but that's a gamble too.Wind is out. It just doesn't make enough for for our dense infrastructure here. At best its tiny bit of supplementary to an existing grid for individual industries that wish to create their own.As far as nuclear research being used to have an advantage in war.....this isn't the 1940s. That ship has sailed long ago.There are over 450 operational nuclear fission plants in over 30 countries on this planet.You're also thinking it would a be uranium plant, which it wouldn't. There is better fuels available now, actually they were always available.....just not used.Singapore doesn't need to be a leader in nuclear research to have generation plants. That research is done by others already and is being used.We just need to implement it.There's a relatively simple paymech scheme that would bring our island into resource independence, without the local government or citizens to bear the weight."
"Nuclear fusion is something people always say is ""20 years away"", but that 20 years becomes 40, then becomes 60. Fusion reactors or experiment reactors are huge and costly and don't work. I think so far humans haven't got to the point where the energy produced is more than the energy needed to sustain the reaction.Don't think we got anything against nuclear fusion, if it becomes real it's even better because that means more energy for water desalination and other stuff. But Singapore doesn't look like the driver behind such a breakthrough because we don't have the space to do such experiments."
"Singapore has been tracking developments in nuclear technology very closely and a floating or submerged NPP is likely to be the long-long term (30+ years from now) power source of choice once gen IV NPPs have been proven in other countries and public opinion on nuclear has improved.Over the mid-long term (20-30 years), natural gas is an excellent bridge source given the abundant global supply.In the meanwhile, solar LCOE will continue to fall substantially and probably become a major power source within 20 years."
"If it’s not economically viable then there’s no argument to be made. What’s our track record in science? What’s the likelihood that Singapore finds a way to make fusion safe and economically viable for sustained used outside of the lab before anyone else does? It’s just cheaper to just wait for a more innovative country like the US to figure it out and just buy the technology from them. Comparative advantage. Also, I think you are too dismissive of solar. Many countries are expanding their solar capture capacity by insane amounts due to its Low prices. It’s the fastest growing energy source today and I am hesitant to agree with you that Singapore won’t find a way to follow the trend. If it’s cheap enough, we can cover every available square inch on land and sea with solar cells."
"It’s not that I’m dismissive of solar. It can supplement our energy needs but it cannot be backbone power.Storage of solar energy is not the same as storage of fuel. If solar is to become backbone power, then we need it for day and night. Batteries and capacitors will be prohibitively huge and costly and fossil footprint will be high. High cloud cover in singapore doesn’t help. Since the cells are connected in series, if even one of them is in the shade, it cuts off current from all other cells.Central station solar power is a viable source of backbone power as opposed to panel-on-every-rooftop but it requires large amount of space. Even if we do it in Malaysia, transmission of power over large distances will be a problem."
Current state of fusion still lab stage. More energy put in than produced. Not stable for energy production. Currently no commercially viable fusion reactors. Maybe your grand kids life time. I've been waiting for the past 20 years and it's still lab stage.
"The world is ridiculously far away from fusion as a direct power authority method.There is world collaboration experimental operation like ITER and if that goes swimmingly then DEMO will be a go. They are long term projects that the science wizards will use to make small changes to.However what Singapore needs is Fission right now.This island desperately needs to be resource independentNot uranium though, there is a much better fuel source that has always been available and can easily be extinguished in the event of a catastrophic breakdown (however crazy unlikely that is).I'll write a new post about this so as to not fully hijack the OP here."
"Ok I’m not sure but do they also require radioactive waste storage and have a risk of nuclear proliferation?Edit: Also I agree, we are quite far from fusion. That’s why I mentioned the depletion of fossil fuels as an impetus to hasten our search for alternative sources of backbone power. The timeline of fossil fuel running out matches that of the time to commercialisation of fusion reactors."
"when fossil fuels run out (something which will happen for the age group of people using reddit), what are we gonna do?Fracking."
"Fracking has been linked to an increase in earthquakes. Also, the use of fossil fuels is bad for our environment."
How old are you and what degree do you have?
Just so you know...Nuclear fusion != nuclear fission
Is it common to type like that? I thought it's just used in programming. Wouldn't people be more familiar with =/=?
That sure is a sleepy fishing village.
"Sig Reginald Stanley Holmes was bayoneted to death by Japanese troops, as he lay wounded in his bed, when the Alexandra Hospital was overrun on 14th February 1942 in Singapore. This infamous incident became known as the ""Alexandra Hospital Massacre"". This was not the first War Crime by Japanese forces, nor would it be the last."
"Among the names inscribed on the Singapore Memorial at the Kranji War Cemetery is that of Silvestr Nemec, a young Czech employee of Bata in Singapore and who was a volunteer in the SSVF. Although the date of his death is listed as 17 Feb 1942, there is a suggestion that he may have been one of those who died in the Alexandra Hospital massacre on 14 February 1942.More at ""Searching for Silvestr"":https://searchingforsilvestr.wordpress.com/…/silvestrs-dea…/"
"I've been in touch with Jan Beránek, to see if there's anything else we can suss out regarding Silvestr's death. Hopefully more stories will emerge."

"What gave it away, the killing or the fact that they were part of the axis?"
"Both think they are master race, tried to genocide the race they hate. They tried conquer the world."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/60/a8515460.shtmlNever forget.
The Japanese S.O.C. called and expressed his regret at what had happened and assured the staff that they had nothing further to fear. He also told the O.C. of the hospital that he was to be regarded as a direct representative of the Emperor and that no higher honour could be paid to the hospital.Well that's interesting
"Some records claim it was Yamashita who visited the hospital, where it was in fact the commander of the 18th Division, Mutaguchi Renya, who did. Mutaguchi acknowledged this, as did Craven (C.O., not O.C. of 32 RAMC). Yamashita himself claimed to not know of this, even going as far as to deem it 'foolish', pointing out that Mutaguchi would know more about the incident."
Brutal
"Just a little footnote, this particular story has seen multiple revisions, and even different authors attributed to it. Most likely was spread around when the staff from 32 RAMC were incarcerated at Changi Camp and Roberts Hospital, and revealed after the war."
They shall not grow old.

"The scenario where GCT just decides to shit talk CCS on a public forum but in reality it was just a joke and they are best pals sounds really implausible.The idea that it could be construed as a compliment is just mind boggling, especially from an ex-leader of a political party that is known to make very precise and judicious word choices in general."
"Guilty! My analogy was a bit of a stretch, but I was stretching it on purpose because I really wanted to use the phrase ""cunt-swilling cocknugget"" in a sentence. Ultimately, I was trying to point out is that we don't know enough about the relationship between the two.Here's a bunch of other possibilities (that I'm really hoping you're not going to debunk one by one because that's not why I'm listing them out): He could've advised or mentored CCS before. He's calling out CCS in public to step up on his public speaking because that's a particularly effective motivator for him. It could be a known quantity between the two that CCS has a long way to go before the younger man matches up to his standards. Perhaps CCS puts in more effort when he's been put on the spot about something. He could be doing this to rein in CCS's ego, presenting it as a hard challenge from old guard to new blood. Or y'know, it could even be about intentionally throwing shade at him to force him to rise above it. Tough love, in a sense.With all this in mind -The entire post is right there. How can someone take it out of context?- I would say there's enough room for context around the on-the-face reading of the post.As I closed off with my previous comment - in the end, this is all just speculation. Unless we get a media expose and interview that the old man is disappointed with the younger members of his party, that's all we're going to get. Sidenote: Totes wouldn't mind getting some more juicy deets on this thoughSo yeah we can continue to analyse this one-liner, cross-reference the author's life and personal history - and so on, but this is beginning to feel way too much like JC lit, and I really don't miss doing meta-analysis on the curtains being blue. Cheers!"
I can't see how it's a compliment in any context.It's acceptable to use that remark on a team assigned a challenging ongoing task if they are your direct subordinates.Not if you are directly commenting on someone's performance on a task.
Bihalari's face in that photo though...
Finally woody... saying what we all have known all along but haven't been able to articulate
GCT. Old but gold. He still got the iron and insight in him.
"even the 3 blind mice could see the mess that ccs was, the drama here is just a senior party cadre going public about it where it was previously unheard of"

ownself insult ownself
"Context: I’m turning 17 this year, waiting for poly.At the beginning of the month I found a part time job listing on Carousell and decided to give it a try, contacted the agent and he said he wanted me to do a one-time job at some restaurant while he gets me a more permanent job and I said ok. On the day itself, he told me to meet up with another agent and I did, after work, the female agent I met with said I will receive my pay on the 15th Feb but when I asked HOW I will get it, she seemed to avoid it. After that my texts to her went blueticked and over the past week, I’ve kept asking the original agent how I’m getting my pay as I didn’t give my bank details (they didn’t ask) and he said he will check with the workplace but he keep saying he will check yet it seems like he didn’t bother checking.The female agent I met made me fill up a particulars form and thats it, its not like a contract with rules printed on it, just a regular particulars form. The agency they’re with is called TOemployment and I feel they are being very shady. Any advice?PS: This is about getting my pay from them, not looking for a new job. (Currently jobless)"
"job listing on CarousellFound the issue.Maybe find a job someplace more reputable? As for the pay issues, I'd say, cut your losses and jump ship ASAP."
"Def shady af to not answer your questions directly but how many days / months did you work at this restaurant?Take note that if u only worked for a day, certain things may be a bit icky, BUT they are still required to pay you by law.You just have to get some black & white to prove that you worked there and report this to MOM if need be.In any case It's 15th today so maybe if your luck's good u will get your pay without any hassles. Restaurants and eateries are generally more flexible with the method of payment, so I'd say cash, paynow or paylah lo."
"I only worked just one shift at this place, the floor manager at the restaurant wrote my name and hours down in their shift schedule so maybe thats some form of verification?"
If u are able to contact the employers to acquire the schedule then may as well ask them about the pay also lo.Tho that may not be too nice to the agents since u are bypassing them.Your call.
"Hey man. Definitely shady. Do you have any form of agreement written down or over whatsapp? Or the job posting?I suggest you approach TADM, you are able to quickly report salary related disputes (20K if no union, 30K if go thru union). It should be settled really quickly and efficiently, this smallclaims tribunal is meant to be very fast.Also, if you still need a job for some cash. I got a lobang $10-$12/hour part time non-sales promoter job if you want"
"I have the job posting but the written agreement is with the agents, unfortunately. On whatsapp they only asked if i wanted to continue working at this place and i declined, with the female agent saying over whatsapp that my pay will be in today (15Feb)."
Ok. Go to TADM after today if they haven't paid you
"Maybe try go for the usual big name places f&b, retail instead of shoddy agency?"
The issue now is that shoddy agency does not want to tell me how my pay is being settled and I don’t want to have my time wasted by working for free and would like to know how to get them to pay me
"Then you want to look for better established agency which will def pay you, or continue working for shoddy agency which might not pay you?"
I only worked for shoddy agency just once and I’m trying to get my pay for that just once. Currently looking for other jobs
"Can you contact the employer instead? They would be able to at least give you an answer.And in future, don’t go through such shoddy agents again. There are tons of apps, legit agencies and you can basically walk in for interviews with almost all F&B and retail outlets.Hope you see your pay soon!"
"Will definitely look into more reputable places, thanks for the help!"
"maybe go for more recognised agencies by searching on places like jobstreet? if this agency screws u over now, they might continue screwing u over during your employment somehow"
I only worked for this agency once and I’ve been hounding the 2 agents about my pay but one doesn’t reply me and the other keeps saying he will check
yeah I don't like the sound of this.make sure you have a signed employment contract. worse comes to worse if they don't pay you can sue in small claims court.
Actually go to MOM about this. Is this agency even licensed? You can Google and find CEI directory.
"Yup just checked and they are licensed, the contact info listed on the MOM website is the agent I contacted."
"Ok, if they haven’t paid up within 7 working days after your assignment, and nowhere in their contract with you states a salary payment date, then contact MOM for help."
"I’m not sure about the contract, but they said over whatsapp message that payday is 15 Feb."
I’m guessing they will probably issue cheques and ask you to go down and collect. Hope you get paid!
"If you have evidence that you’ve worked there, that’s good! Also conversation screenshots between you and them would also be good. Since they’re agents from an agency, perhaps you can bring this matter up to their higher ups too (without informing the lady and the guy, speak to someone else from the company directly). If these don’t work, it’s time to gently warn them that you’ll be going to the MOM for settlement. You can let them know that if they don’t give you your pay as promised, you WILL go to MOM as a last option."
"I have a feeling the guy owns this agency tho, went to the CEI directory and found their license, their listed contact info is the same as the guy’s. I’ll pester them again today"
"To be honest though, if you just worked a single shift it might be more hassle than worth to get your pay if they're unwilling to cooperate."
"I really dont know how to start this but I can just say I have been having some problems. Quite a few actually. I've been sent to school counsellors since primary school but because its a christian school, the counselling did not help. If anything I think they made it worse.12 years passed and I'm still in a ditch. Im 👌this close to ending it but I only have my mother left. I don't want to leave her alone. Is IMH worth it? What happens if I call? What happens afterwards? I'm very scared and this is my last resort. I cant seem to trust my school counsellors. Quote on quote from the vice dean, ""If you're going to be this difficult, maybe you don't belong here""."
"I was warded there for a bit and in all honestly, it made my situation worse. What ultimately helped me pulled through was the support of my parents, siblings and my girlfriend. I also took on hobbies and started going for religious classes and my condition became better gradually until I was fine. I wouldn't recommend going to IMH based on my own personal experience, but if you say that its a last resort, maybe you can give it a try. Its different for everyone, perhaps the medications there can help you. With that said, just remember, there's a light at every tunnel's end."
"Thanks for replying. As someone who is from a religious background its a bit hard for me to find solace in it. I'm glad you managed to pull through and find faith in religion though! My mother doesn't really believe in mental illnesses and stuff so she always tells me it'll go away, god can cure it and stuff but I don't know. Doesn't seem to be working."
"Works differently for everyone, I found peace when I started my daily prayers. My mom was like that, very old fashioned. She didn't believe of my condition until she saw me suffering in IMH, that's when she truly believe that I was going through something more serious. I think you need a few people in your life who'll listen to you and perhaps get a hobby, try out something new that you've always had reservations about. I started boxing & leather crafting after I left IMH, best choice of my life"
"That's really wonderful. I tried to confide in my friends but because we were all studying they usually brushed me off with an ""im busy"" or when i confide they say like ""Oh i myself--"" that kinda stuff you know? I have a few hobbies like art and stuff but recently it has become a chore and its really tiring to do anything. I really want to try martial arts and stuff but was always restricted because of my mother's religious thinking again. Religion for some reason always held me back :/"
"May seem harsh but it seems like those friends don't really care enough to listen. I fully recommend trying out martial arts, you'll meet really caring & supportive people along the way. There's a few martial arts schools here that provides equipments to students, this way you don't have to buy much equipments making it easier for you to train unnoticed. If you're still reserved on martial arts, why not try Yoga first until you have more confidence"
"My mom forbids yoga for religious reasons @-@ but I'm still really interested in martial arts! I think I might check one out during the holidays or something, thank you!"
My mom forbids yoga for religious reasons @-@Harh what religion is that?
Christianity. Christians are wild man
Your family is following an extreme version man... I can introduce you to more reasonable and less heretical versions of Christianity if you wish.
"less heretical versions of Christianity if you wish.Says the heretic....On a more serious note, everybody is someone else's heretic."
Sure! I've been trying really hard to restore my faith and I'll take any recommendations really! Thank you!
"Is there really such a community of Christians in Singapore? Genuinely curious. Having been in Christian circles, I find that a lot of them are conservative no matter where I go. I guess it's an evangelist/presbyterian thing."
"Going out on a limb to sound like a crazy here, but the reason why Yoga isn't permitted is because Yoga had Hindu mysticism roots, and Christianity on a whole doesn't like that, because for us anything related to religion and spiritualism can and should only come from one source, our God."
"Holy shait hahahaha, please do try out martial arts, it'll help you. I'm about to start my first BJJ class today and i'm extremely excited. Anyway, all the best and never give up"
Thank you!! I'm excited for you too HAHA. All the best to you too!
"Go do grappling. Higher skill ceiling, but satisfying pay off."
"Thanks for the recommendation! I remember a friend talking about it, I'll ask him about it!"
"Hey erm, if you'd like to you can PM me. I'm Christian, going through similar issues. We can try to work it out.I went IMH previously, checked myself in a couple of years ago. It's a super uphill battle but I'm coming to terms on how to work out my issues slowly."
Fk the god story again...
"Wow I'm glad that this forum is helping people who are reaching out for help.OP, just be mindful that every walk in case at IMH will be assessed by the psychiatrist. If you're deem suicidal or a serious case, you will be strongly recommended to be warded.So you need to see if that's what you want. You will be stripped of all possession and lose all contacts with anyone at all. Depending on your case, you will be given medication. (Usually they start with sleeping pills and fluxoamine)I personally didn't like IMH, after one night and I knew I had to get out. Sometimes the other patients can further worsen your conditions. And there's no fixed date to get discharged; I have met patients who are there for like months / years.Hope you get the help you need."
"Oh no is that so? Because if im seeking help this time i really want to let them know what im going through instead of hiding information or lying. But I dont want to get warded for the suicidal thoughts that I had. I really dont want to lose my contacts either.. Especially that last part, I can't really have anything affecting my studies now. I left my poly in year 2 for mental health reasons and I really dont want to do it again.."
"Don't fret OP.Maybe don't go to IMH then. My parents and GF forced me there because I attempted suicide.I am seeing a counsellor at Counselling and care centre. Why not check that place out? They have pretty good counsellors.IMH is really a last resort imo, don't go there unless you know you cannot control your suicidal urges."
"Oh dear.. Sorry to hear that, glad to hear you're getting the help you deserve now! I'm currently searching the counselling and care centre online and they seem to have good reviews! I will check that place out! Thank you and all the best to you!"
"I strongly recommend Counselling and Care. Know of someone who visited (for different problems), and it really made a difference. They tend to be quite booked up but explain on the urgency of your situation, and they might fast track you.Fees are income based, so it might be at the lower end for you.Best of luck to OP - know that such things are not a stigma and you’re never alone."
Hey! What are their rates? Thinking of going for counselling sessions.
"Better to go now. They are going to adjust their rate w.e.f 1st April.Prices range from 40 to 180 per session, excluding a $10 charge for consultation after 530pm.It used to be much more affordable"
Wow that a huge range! I used to see one that was $150 but it’s not practical for long term. The public ones are mon-fri so its like if you work you gotta splurge on private? From my experience. Thanks for the info!
I agree. the anxiety of staying in and wanting to get out make it seems like you are just another lunatic when essentially you are very much sane of your choices.The dosage of their medication might be a little too high honestly :(
"Yea. It's a terrible experience, and this is coming from me staying in MDU (Mood Disorder unit), which is much better vs. The general ward.Even then, the severe cases are quite terrible"
"go to the polyclinic first to get a referral so that you're under subsidised rate.the polyclinic can either refer you directly to IMH or one of the public hospitals that also have psych clinics. or these days all polyclinics dedicate one day a week whereby psychiatrists from IMH or the other hospitals visit and see you in a polyclinic environment. these are typically for less serious cases.can't really tell from your description whether you need a psychiatrist or psychologist. if you need a psychologist or counselling / therapy type services, then only IMH has them.unfortunately with subsidised healthcare, you can't choose which doctor you see. new cases likely will be assigned to some junior consultant. because of the volume of cases they see, it feels like a production factory. don't expect quality care."
Thanks for replying. I myself don't really know what I need. I'm afraid to go to the polyclinic because I'm afraid they might actually refer me to a psych clinic and they would have to notify my mother or some shit like that and I dont want her to know. Shows how much i know sadly.
"There is no obligation to inform your parents, so don't worry about it. As with all hospitals, there'll be good and bad doctors. However, as a patient, do note that you're always allowed to request for a different one if you feel your current psychiatrist isn't compatible.Personally, I had one of my worst encounters at IMH via a doctor that spent the whole sessions proselytizing and intimating that I just needed to find my faith. The good thing is that a complaint to their QC hotline got me reassigned ASAP to one who has been great. I don't mean this to scare you but to alert you to the reality that even if your first experience with a psychiatrist isn't the best, it's okay, because there are good ones out there."
"I actually didn't know that, thank you for the info! I'm always fearing that they'll tell my mom espcially after what my school counsellors always reported to her. big oof"
That feels like such a breach of privacy to share your counselling sessions with your mom. Sorry to hear. It's awful!
Yeah thats why I stopped going to the school counsellors. In the end my mom sent me to a social worker but it just made me into a really good liar in case they expose info again. Its really awful :/
"I actually found the counsellors/psychologists and social workers to be the best part of IMH. Certainly, they do respect your privacy, especially if you request specifically to not to inform your mom.On the other hand, when I was finally ready to do so, they were extremely helpful at getting my mom involved in the loop and explaining to her. Just wanted to let you know that's also an option eventually.Anyway, all the best, and don't let your previously terrible experiences deter you from getting the help you deserve! :)"
"That's really great! I'll try my best not to let the previous experiences affect me. I'll try to check it out soon, thank you!"
if you're under 21 they likely have to get consent from parents to start you on psych meds. they may also be obligated to inform your parents if you are a risk to yourself (ie suicidal)
oh gosh. I really dont want my mom to find out about this.
"Hi fll0yd, sharing with u a very personal experience just because i think it will help you. Try not to make the mistake of warding yourself at IMH. I came from an abusive family and had a major breakdown..fyi i was already a few years older than you at that point of time and yet i felt so restricted by my family even though i already was a full grown adult. Poly clinic referral was taking quite long and my anxiety (PTSD) was beyond what i could handle especially since i did not know wht was wrong with me. Spiritually,it was hard for me to progress in such a state though i was trying.My parents or mum was similar to yours so i admitted myself at IMH. Very dark and traumatizing experience,yes i wanted to help myself and that was the only way i could do it but it wasn't the right choice. There were all these odd outbreaks of screaming in the ward and the random one or two patients talking to no one in particular. I kept crying (& if u cry too much apparently, they tie u up. So i forced myself to stop crying when I heard that)and said that i wanted to get out,i kept mentioning that I admitted myself and it's my choice to leave but nah that's not how it works.once you're in it's up to the staff/psychiatrist to evaluate u and discharge u... and fyi it takes a few days before u even get to see the doc.No staff from the inside takes you seriously and they shower you with a hose.Like someone said here,u have to fake yourself as alright and stable to get by.I spoke calmly but with a sense of urgency to the doc and i was finally discharged that day.It made me appreciate the outside world alot.Long journey after that but i discovered a wonderful therapist who i work with regarding my mild anxiety. Meditation is a LIFE SAVER,keeps me sane and grounded. I am not on long term meds,only on short term ones, lorazapems which i take whenever i can't sleep or only whenever i have a panic attack. Pm me if u want me to connect u with my therapist.Also KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU'RE AN ADULT. You are responsible for you,hon. If u kill urself,ur family might cry a year or two but they'll go on with it.Keep going,love.Edit: Was eating when i typed this post so lots of weird grammar errors.Fixed."
"Oh no that's really bad! I'm so happy that you finally got the help you needed! I've tried meditating on my own time, but I'm not very good HAHA i get very antsy quickly. I would love to know more about your therapist though! They sound really wonderful!"
"You can try borrowing those 'simple meditation' type of books from the self-help section in the library. It has very secular meditation techniques made very simple. I see a private therapist not in a govt hospital. I used to work in the govt sector and couldn't keep taking time-offs to go for appts during working hours. Private clinics offer appointment dates on weekends and after working hours on weekdays so yeah..My therapist is a lovely,compassionate person who really seems to understand how the mind works. Sadly, many health professionals do not understand how mental illnesses work. I've had a therapist tell me to ""be happy and not to keep thinking of negative thoughts""...sigh..yeah many still don't understand that we're not voluntarily thinking it but the mind forcibly throws these images at us. But yeah there's that...and there are great ones too(:"
"Hey there, do you mind sharing which clinic or centre your therapist is from?"
"Lol. I don't know what is the intention of cafe monster, when his posts are neither encouraging nor helpful.It really ticked me off. It's already hard to have to relive the experience and put it out there so that others don't walk the same path.Only to have some goon come and shit all over it. Smh"
"Thank you for this,really."
You're welcome. We're all just healing and helping one another.
"They shower you with a hose? I highly doubt that, Which ward were you in? And no they only tie up those who are violent ."
"These kind of comments are one of the reasons why i was very hesitant to post something so personal and painful online. If you highly doubt that, admit yourself there. Also try constantly crying in fear while you're there and see what the staff tell you.All the best, don't bother replying to me."
"Lmao, that’s not answering the question and stop down voting people just because you disagree with them Gosh, seriously man. You really need to read properly. Don’t assume people have never been warded there themselves . The fact that you’re assuming already shows a lot about the reliability in your comment."
Do you want to PM me instead?
"From your experience and reply , it already tells people a lot about the validity of you getting warded in IMH . Honestly lol, shower you with a hose? They shower you? You don’t shower yourself? Lol."
"Well,well...Doesn't anonymity give you a such a sense of bravado? I literally just asked you to pm me if your intention really was to know more about my time there. Look at you, so convinced about my credibility already."
"Lol, you really can’t understand sarcasm. That’s a sign of an unhealthy mind bro . I’m asking you right now , the Nurses in IMH, do they shower you naked with a hose like what you implied? Yes or no."
"Yes they did,the first day. And firstly who are you to judge my own experience? Since you are so focused about answering questions,were you even admitted there in the first place?? And you are telling me that I have an unhealthy mind when you are the one laughing with your inappropriate ""lols"" like a lunatic in each of your comments."
"I’m not judging , I’m just trying to clarify. Answering questions? I’m asking you questions , not trying to answer them. Ok I’m a lunatic, I’m sure everyone who comments a ‘lols’ must be a lunatic uh-huh."
"Anyway, just whatever . If they really did shower you with a hose naked , with you being exposed , I’m really sorry to hear that and know that it shouldn’t be done . Thanks for replying"
can i ask how old are you? are you still studying or working? do u have to serve NS? this will help us to give u better advice
I'm still studying. Just recently hit 20. I'm a female so NS isn't necesssary for me :x
"I see, if you're already 20 and you're afraid of your parents finding out, I will suggest getting help from private clinic, which will prescribe you with anti-depressants which may help your situation. Don't be afraid to get help. The problem with going to IHM is your medical record will be permanently kept and you may be labelled as ""mentally unwell"". This may jeopardize your future if you ever want to work a government job. As far as I know, private clinic's patient info is not linked with the government's central data sys, so there is no way your mum will ever find out. (You provide the clinic with your particulars, etc)All the best to you. feel free to pm me, i will try to help if i could"
"Thank you so much for replying! I think I might see a private clinic when I'm free, hopefully soon. I really don't want to affect my studies as of now. but thank you really for the help!"
"Oh! Thanks for the info! I still have to think on what I want to achieve then. Because rn I dont even know whats up. I'm going on Tues to a polyclinic, hopefully it goes well!"
Alright! Thank you!
"Wait, what school are you attending? I am not aware of any tertiary christian schools."
no no not tertiary. My primary and secondary were christian. But those were horrible enough
Ok I thought the school counselor thing is recent. Cuz I saw you mention you are 20 years old.
oh well I mean the last time was when i was 16. The social worker was like when i was 17 then it stopped after 4 months.
"Heya,Most resources have already been covered by previous comments. You can also consider going to CHAT at Scape Orchard. While they are a offshoot clinic by imh, the ppl inside can give a better recommendation for the next step forward based on your needs and concerns, esp on privacy and costs.Take care, and all the best.Ps: your dean is an arse."
Oh! Thank you for the recommendation! I'm quite near orchard so hopefully I can check it out once my class ends. Thank you!
"I have been having some problemsWhat problems do you have?I'll advise against school counselors cuz they'll just say pray the problem away which is really not helpful.If you really have clinical depression or any form of mental illness, medicine will help. You don't have to go IMH, but can try going to polyclinic first for referral."
"that's exactly what they said. ""Pray the problem away""I'm honestly unsure if its just depression. Yknow like, my emotions, especially towards people can go from ""Wow youre my best friend"" to like ""If it werent for the laws of this land I would have killed you"" that kind you know? Its even worse than a mood swing. It can just happen in an instant and stay that way for days, even weeks. There are moments of emptiness, like dissociation and stuff. Suddenly for no reason I can be at my worst and I'll get irritated at everything and anything."
"First, you must be commended for recognizing something is not right. It take utmost humility and also self awareness to be able to say “I am not well, I need help”.Just by this acknowledgement alone puts you at a much higher pedestal than most people on the planet.Don’t beat yourself over it, but do go and speak to proper medical professionals who will direct you to the right channel. Maybe it is something that medicine can help, or it is something therapy can help. Don’t shy away and just go to those places other commenters have suggested.Also, you are 20, which means that the doctors won’t be able to share your information to your mum. You are your own person.I wish you all the best!"
Thank you for the kind words!I'm planning to go to a clinic on tuesday with a close friend! It's also such a relief to know my information wont be released to her HAHAThank you!
So you're having some kind of mood disorder you believe? Has it been affecting your day-to-day life a lot?
"Quite a lot really. It just pops out of no where. It happens quite a lot and like, its been affecting my relationships with my mom and friends. It's affecting my studies too, like I can get distracted easily, i seem really out of it according to my classmates. I'm not sure if the mood is affecting it or something else is."
"Have you behaved like that since when you were much younger? I'm not a doctor, but if the answer to that is yes, it sounds like you have a personality disorder. Depression is probably just the symptom, not the cause. I have borderline personality disorder so I can very much identify with your behaviour. I'm sure you'll be googling that, but don't read up too much on it though, it's just a suggestion from me."
"It started happening when I was like 9, 10? I just remember switching from like your best friend kind of character to the kind of kid that will push you down the stairs in an instant.But actually, when I took a Psychology Elective in Poly, my teacher actually said I exhibited some traits from BPD when I told him about it :o"
"That's how I ruined friendships and relationships as well. I used to turn against friends very often.But actually, when I took a Psychology Elective in Poly, my teacher actually said I exhibited some traits from BPD when I told him about it :oHow did he realize that? You told him about what you experienced?Do you also experience emotions intensely which cause you do things that are out of character? That's the best indicator of bpd since emotional dysfunction is what bpd is all about."
"Yeah! Like my anger is the emotion that drives me the most. Like just a casual playful nudge makes me want to snap. In conversations when my friend doesn't get what im trying to say to them I just get really frustrated and either ignore the chat or start going ham on the keyboard. ive done that to friends, partners, even my own mom. Its been like this for so long I just thought it was part of my character now."
Unfortunate thing about bpd is that it's not treatable like depression or anxiety. You can be taught healthy coping mechanisms but you will still continue experiencing strong emotions. The world is unfair isn't it. :/
Ahhh damn. I really wanted to put an end to it but I guess healthy coping mechanisms will have to do. So it's curable in a sense! Thanks for the info!
"Your vice dean either needs to learn how to phrase things correctly, or is an actual arse."
Maybe a little bit of both i guess HAHA
"There are other psychiatric options available. My SO went to a polyclinic first then got a referral to counselling which has really helped her a lot with d. Not sure about other options, but you can PM me if you need any details!"
Thank you for replying! From suggestions I might go to a polyclinic or a private clinic but another thing im worried about is the cost. I've only ever been to one family doctor so I really dont know much. abit shameful to be a singaporean huh HAHA
"Getting a referral through polyclinic definitely makes it much cheaper, though of course wait times are more. Medication cheaper as well I think, thought I guess I don’t have a particular frame of reference. Another alternative, since you’re schooling is to check with your school’s medical centre. NUS’s University Health Centre has some in-house counsellors (which are open to public actually on second thought), and are more professional than many jc/secondary school counsellors IMO if that scares you.Glad that you are seeking help and taking action, that’s the important first step!"
Oh I didn't know those counsellors were open to the public. That's new! Still a little nervous about barging into a school I'm not even attending to ask for help so I might go with the Polyclinic HAHA. Thank you for helping me!
"Lemme check with a friend on that to confirm(whether it’s open to public). I can’t seem to find the link she sent me previously. But yes polyclinic did work for my SO, even if it took a little longer. All the best!!"
Alright sure! Thank you again for the recommendations!
"Yup anyway upon a double check with my Friend, the clinical and health psychology centre located in the UHC is open to public but not the UHC counselling services itself. I suppose it would count as a private clinic as others have suggested then!"
aw darn. Its alright! Thank you for coming back to tell me! Really appreciate it!
👍🏻👍🏻💪💪
"Try going to see a psychologist at polyclinics first. $30 for long sessions and $20 for short sessions. Should the psychologist feel that you would need to move to a psychiatrist they would recommend you. You dont have to necessary go IMH to seek help for mental health. Some of the government hospitals also do provide psychiatrist services. But likewise, it may take a while for you to set your appointments. If you do can afford it, see a private one. Seeing a private psychiatrist would also keep it away from your records."
"Thanks for the reply! I was really thinking of seeing a private one but that would be extremely expensive compared to the ""open"" ones right?"
"Yes. Extremely more expensive. Could cost up to $200 per visit. But if you do go see a psychiatrist, remember that they are mostly there to prescribe you medicine. Sessions at psychiatrists tend to be much shorter. If you do need to have a consistent chat with someone, you can see a psychologist for therapy regularly as a cheaper option to having long session with psychiatrists."
"Oh jeez. Sad to say I didn't know the difference between a psychologist and psychiatrist, big thanks for letting me know! I'm going to the clinic on Tuesday, hopefully I can find the help I need there!"
Psychologist somewhat learn that all these mental illness are due to our behavior and somewhat routine(?) but they are not allowed to prescribe medicine. Whereas psychiatrist learn that all these happen due to biological changes in the body as well. So they are allowed to prescribe medicine.No problem! Hope you do get the help you need. Hope to hear an update from you soon! And Happy Valentines Day! 💓
"Oh! You learn something new everyday HAHAAnd I'll try my best to update, thank you! Happy Valentines Day to you too! 💓"
"I commend you for being so self-aware, knowing where the issues lie and having the courage to seek help. It sounds like you are facing tremendous pressure being LGBT, having a Christian fundamentalist parent and having had an unhelpful and hurtful Christian schooling environment.Firstly, recognise that certain religious environments can be abusive and detrimental to the wellbeing of LGBTs and even heterosexuals. You are already at your wit’s end. It is time to walk away from what you feel is hurting you.I just googled LGBT counselling and an LGBT-friendly church (if you still wish to reconcile your faith and who you are as a human being). Give Oogachaga counselling a call today and see how they can help you. I feel that non-LGBT sensitive/anti-LGBT or faith-based counselling may injure someone who is already badly hurting.Free Community Church is an LGBT-friendly church from what I have read. I wouldn’t go telling your mother these if she is already a fundamentalist who doesn’t allow you to even do yoga.Since you are highly interested in martial arts, you should pursue it despite your mum, if it will help you. A sports environment and lifestyle can help many people who feel like they are in a bad place.Do give Oogachaga a call today! If there are limitations, ask them for referrals and names/numbers. They are the ones with the resources and have seen many like you. I wish you the best! Hang in there!"
"I tried walking away a few times but can't do much espcially with my mom being so close to me. I mean, we only have each other :xI've heard of Free Community Church actually! I really want3d to give them a call but I'm a little(quite) afraid. But Oogachaga sounds interesting! I will check it out!Thank you for the recommendations and the kind words!"
"You’re welcome! Nah, I am not saying to walk away from mum, just that you don’t need to tell her right now that you are calling up Oogachaga or visiting FCC or doing martial arts since she will stop you from seeking helpful resources. The priority is you now, and to get you help. Later on, when all is better, you can decide how much is safe to share.If you are afraid, I think you can just pop into a FCC service with a friend like any other church right? No need to call. As for Oogachaga, yeah, try and call today so you can plan forward for any appointments if necessary."
Most of my friends arent actually christian so going there would be a lone job 😂 Thank you for the advice though! I'll check them out after school!
It is okay to journey alone and just walk into a church. You can walk out anytime if you’re uncomfortable. Or get to know more people like yourself there when you are ready. I think you have a lot of strength within yourself. There are some journeys in life where we all have to walk on our own. :)
Ahhh thank you for the advice! I'll have to get used to opening up then HAHA. Thank you again!
You’re welcome!
"On the topic of being a LGBT Christian, you might want to check out a video titled ""Elsa & Aj Choosing between Faith and Sexuality Christians"" by Sg Narratives. I'm not sure if you are LGBT or not. If you are, the video might give you a fresh pov and provide some mental respite. Jiayou!"
"Hi, I see your reply to me but are you asking me or the OP?"
"Lol I had intended to share that with the OP. Apologies I'm new here, so I'm still getting myself acquainted with posting etiquette."
"No worries. Thanks for being helpful. You can either hit the arrow to a reply to address that reply/writer, or just type direct into the comment box below a post to address the OP."
You might want to try NUH instead. I find the environment and doctors a little better than IMH.
Alright! Thank you!
"I don't think many people speak openly about this.Just wanna say for all those who are seeking for help, taking the first step is always tough. It's not gonna be easy. Not going to sugar coat it. But the only person that can break this cycle is you. But hey, your loved ones are just walking behind you throughout this journey. Anytime you fall, they got your back.For those whose family members or loved ones that are having a tough time, don't judge them for their suicidal tendencies. They are already fighting to live on every single day. It is really helpless and tiring for caregivers but hey, love them for as long as they are in this world. Even if they eventually make that decision, at the end of the day, you will still know that you never stop loving and they will remember your love too."
"I went to my school's healthcare centre when i had problems but it seems like you tried that already and it didn't work out. Polyclinic referral would be the next best choice. Don't do anything too drastic, good luck!Also your vice dean sounds like actual human garbage"
"Yeah from a lot of kind recommendations here I think I will go to a polyclinic, hopefully soon! now im trying to find clinics near my place, hopefully get an appoinment. and yeah shes pretty garbage :x"
Just remember that while there are garbage people that don't care about the mental well-being of people; there are helpful people like the ones in this thread who genuinely want you to get better. Good luck!
Thank you so much! It's really touching to see how many responses I've gotten! It's really nice.
"IMH is like that:If you're in there for long period of time, even if you weren't siao at the start, you'll go siao after long.The environment is anything but conducive, it's not a rehabilitation center, it's a containment unit to prevent people from harming themselves while surrounding them with other people who are eitherreally siaoreally depressedNobody you stay with there will actually assist you (the patients) and the only people that can help you are only able to visit you during certain timings.If you think about it, it's really just a jail for people who have very high potential for self harm or are just really nuts.You are more likely to recover from your illness by going through psychotherapy AND taking the psychiatric drugs, but you ALSO need to make active decisions in your life to get better. Just going to therapy sessions and taking meds isn't enough, they can only help those who want to help themselves."
Oh dear that's really bad. Thank you for the information thought! Hopefully I wont have to go there
This is only if you are warded there. The consultations are all pretty normal and you get to go back home after that.
ahhh i see. Thank you!
A very accurate description sadly
Hang in there. Get help from here: https://www.ncss.gov.sg/Press-Room/Publications/Detail-Page?id=Mental-Health-Resource-Directory See which service can help you and contact them.
Alright! Thank you for the link! I'll check it out
"I briefly considered going down to IMH to put myself under observation BC I was really worried about my mental health (I'm diagnosed with MDD and I see a psychiatrist at CGH). So I searched up what IMH is like, and from what I've read of people's experiences at IMH, it sounds awful. Most people just send it either made things worse or they faked being fine to get out of there. I would advise trying to go somewhere else. Maybe CGH psychiatry? Or if you're studying at uni then they should have mental wellness resources right? Long story short, I'd leave IMH as a last resort type measure. Hope you find help :) And you could always DM me to talk about how you're feeling, I'd love to help!!"
"Thank you for replying! I never knew Changi hosp had a psychiatry :O I think i'll check it out! Sadly I'm not in uni right now and the counselors in my current school is apparently hard to find?? Like my friend told me to get to them we would have to go through the teachers or something, pretty messed up. But thank you for the recommendations, I'll check it out!"
"I wasn’t warded at IMH, but was instead warded at NUH. Not sure about the difference in costs, but my experience at NUH was great and I’ve heard nothing but bad things about IMH. So basically if those who get warded at NUH gets too extreme and hard to handle, they get moved over to IMH. I had a couple of friends from NUH who’ve been in and out a couple of times who said that there is screaming there ALL THE TIME and that the Nurses / Doctors don’t really care about you / are more dismissive of you. Please take note that this isn’t a first hand recount because I didn’t go there but yeah, don’t really recommend IMH.On that note, I DO recommend getting help. I’ve struggled a lot myself and finally getting proper medication, therapy and time to myself to just deal with my problems (NUH has a two week policy where they don’t give you your phones + no friends allowed except family and it sounds like crap but it really helped). So yeah! Wishing you all the best and if you ever need someone to talk to, I’m here :)"
Thank you so much! I heard some bad things about IMH but I didnt know it was that bad :x If I visit a polyclinic and if they refer me to NUH(still dont really know how this works sorry) will I have to take time off school? Because now is really crucial but at the same time it is really affecting my mental health. I dont want to affect anything important if possible..
"Yeah you will have to! NUH is usually 2-3 weeks (unless you’re REALLY REALLY severe) but I swear it’s worth it! Idk how old you are now but I took two weeks off Uni during the sem and it was worth it (I started studying better, my mental state was def better). Had a friend who was with me who was taking his As that year, he did fine after his time off as well. You’ll just have to see how bad you currently are and how much it is worth. If your studies/life is really affected by how you are, you might want to consider just taking the time off. After all, 2 weeks to get your head straight is definitely better than a sudden mental breakdown (I speak from experience).Anyways, I’m glad you’re taking the first step to get better, all the best! :) it’s quite rare to have other Singaporeans to talk to regarding this sort of thing so if you wanna chat lmk :)"
"Thanks for the info! Im still nervous thinking about having to take time off but maybe if really necessary, I'd be more open to it, we'll have to see! Also thank you, it really is rare to find other Singaporeans talk about this issue. I'm open to chatting although I can be a little shy in pms HAHA it'll take me a litttle bit of time getting used to!"
"I'm sorry to hear. Regardless of what the horrible things that have been said to you, life can get better. I do suggest seeking professional help. If you're still in school I suggest starting with CHAT (https://www.chat.mentalhealth.sg/) first. They're affiliated with IMH but with a focus on youth.Please take care in the meantime. If you need help don't hesitate to talk to someone first! Do keep us updated, we all want the best for you!"
Will do! Thank you so much! I'm thinking of going to a clinic next tuesday! hopefully it goes well!
"This is kinda late, but I believe CHAT has the first consultation where they do an assessment for free although it would take sometime to get a slot.Take care!"
"If you have the financial capability I’d strongly recommend seeking a clinical psychologist elsewhere. I’ve heard some pretty bad stuff from friends who’ve gone to IMH, especially those who ended up warded. One friend with a dissociative disorder got told that they merely had an overactive imagination, another kept being passed around from psychiatrist to psychiatrist and ultimately resolved nothing. Of course, it also ultimately comes down to the psychologist/therapist themselves, I know people who have encountered shitty private practitioners, but I’ve largely heard better things from private psych practices than from IMH. All the best fam"
"Oh dear, I hope your friends have found the help they needed! Thank you for the information! Looks like I made the right choice in not calling them last night, dodged a real bullet there"
"As someone who is also going through something and have visited imh a few times, I can say that it doesn't really help as people expect it to. The patients there are usually much more mentally disabled. Im not sure how helpful it'll be to be warded with others who are also fighting their own demons. Having a consultation with a psycharitrist there may offer some more insight on both your own issues and the treatment they can offer you inside imh. No harm giving it a try. I dont think they can force u to ward, especially if u can speak clearly and don't seem in danger."
"Oh I see! Thank you for replying! Yeah after seeing the many comments, IMH seems to be a really scary place. I'm planning to see a polyclinic first before I do anything else, but again thank you for the information! I hope you're doing well and all the best to you!"
"No worries, and thank you! I hope you find what you're looking for soon."
"If you need someone to talk to, a listening ear or just a friend, do drop me a pm alright. You aren't alone. Hang in there mate."
Thank you for the offer and the kind words! I'm a little shy but I can update you when I go to the clinic!
Anytime you need someone. :)
"As someone who has a relation being warded in IMH for an extended period of time, i dont feel that it would be a conducive place for recovery. I have gone many times for visiting and the place will take a toll on you permanently. Try seeking alternative options in the long run if possible."
"don't have any actual experience in IMH, apart from the few times i accompany my platoon mate there to see the doctor for stress issues. from my limited time there, I feel the environment there isn't a 'safe place' and the police (NSF?) and other staff are too blatantly obvious and threatening ahh. got one time got this loud person try to scream and stuff, i feel the way the people there handle the situation quite bad ah, but then i got the benefit of hindsight. I think this reflects bad on the culture lah although i got see some very hardworking nurses and social workers there, so your mileage may vary ah.but the ones I've heard, thought limited, are bad. a friend of a friend got warded there because my friend called the police. then kena blame here and there, few years later seem to get worse, and no signs of getting better. there's many examples of these horror stories ah.if you really go, need to know your way out, your options, how not to be like trapped there against your will. really have to have someone you can trust and won't think you are crazy and can act under pressure to go with you to IMH ahh, i think there really very dangerous de. (not fear-mongering, but based on experiences of my fren ahh, better to be safe than sorry.) that's why if you can afford should go private, but should still go see someone about the issue if you can ahh, preferably a professional. i think usually in singapore, there are a lot of resources arh, like FSCs and stuff like that. i personally biased towards buddhist organisations lah, cuz i'm chinese, but if you christian maybe YMCA better, or if like christianity breeds some kind of hatred in you, something more neutral and strapped away from religion better.personally, what i think is important is that you are receptive towards the treatment ah. i know friends who are like damn against psychotherapy or those who are like very affected by the stigma of mental health or those that are like damn against medicine. they kinda sort through their problems themselves cuz they are like smart and capable. i'm sure you also are lah, but you seem like you are q desperate, so might not have the time, effort and consciousness to do all that.i think even seeing a counsellor is not like a cure-all thing. it's just something to help you start moving towards something lah. if you don't put in effort, also no use de. like i feel a lot of self-reflection involved and then like examination of your thinking, what you are inclined towards, and then stuff like that lah. everyone different de, but then i feel like a lot of ppl like sama sama leh, that's why i bother writing all that lorh. so like dont get your expectations too high lah.got medication and all sorts of different ways to control depression and stuff lah. the idea is about being in 'control' lo, sometimes need help of medication, sometimes no need. depends on the situation ah. not saying don't rely on medication, but like dont needlessly rely on medication lo.i know i very luosuo and then in the end nvr give much stuff also, but then hopefully got some help maybe ahh! just my 2 cents really!"
"Abit more exposure here but the reason why I couldnt find solace in my school counsellors and stuff is because I am LGBT? My church hasnt exactly been very friendly to those who have come out, lowkey forcing them into like, anti lgbt talk and shit.I managed to sort through my own problems, managed to take care of myself for the past 12 years but now its really at a point I cant seem to take it anymore. Its really affecting my studies, my sleep schedule, just me in a whole. I realised like the way I used to take control of myself wasnt good as well. Like, for example I stopped self harming myself, but found out that if i was stressed or anything, i would use my nails to tear at my skin, at my face and it has become something i do subconsciously out of boredom.My outlook on life has become worse and like, my mood swings are so random and sudden it's affecting my relationships a bit too much. I think I just really want help to get me back in control again I guess."
"ahhh! the LGBT community.i still don't know what to think about the christian community here. majority of them seemed okay, but there seems to be a small, but significant part of the Christians here who have quite bigoted ideas.i have a friend who was lgbt and got coerced into this conversion camp and now he's like ""i realised my mistakes"" and all that shit, when in fact some days you can hear tinges of regret in his tone and times where he isn't really acting like himself (may be confirmation bias but that's what i inferred lorh).got another friend, parents don't allow her to interact with ppl from other races cuz dun want to kena bad influence, got locked up and imprisoned bcuz of that a few times sia. at first wanted to call cops a few times de but i think got it under control lah, smart people and all that.i think there's still quite a big part of sg christian community that is quite bigoted lahi considered religion at one point in my life, but would never touch Christianity, not even with a 10-foot pole man.for me, what helped me was a good community lah, but i find it very hard to keep in touch with them when i'm feeling terrible also. sometimes when you start over-relying on others, it also gets pretty bad when the support you expected didn't come quick enough. i think learning how to manage and resolve these issues by oneself is also quite important also.living a life separate from the church is possible lah. i would say leave as soon as possible lah, cuz i'm like super biased against the church de. comparmentalise your life if you still have to go to church, don't let it influence your personal space, personal thoughts, or your personal life, especially with regards to LGBT issues. I think if you don't talk about it and give standard answers when people probe, people won't bother about it with you anymore. hopefully.people tend to like push these concerns about self-harm and stuff to one corner, and not let it affect them until it's too late lah. i think you realising its a problem is like a huge step forward ald, even though there's still a long long way to go.like the others said arh, go look for external counsellors and try to find something that can like support your mental state. build better connections with others or with yourself. and understand why you are feeling this way. not a counsellor arh, so take everything i say with a pinch of salt. try to experiment and see what works for you.\ you said you have your mum that you want to live for right? that's important arh, that's what's keeping you alive right now. try to think about why it keeps you living, would the pillar of support not being there destroy you?\ depending on how you view life, whether you think about it or not, it can be really really depressing or uplifting. many times extreme moods, good or bad, are due to a lack of perspective. ehhh. just randomly typing stuff that flows out of my head."
nice
"“The literature is divided. Well, there are a lot of good things that we can read about it, but experts aren’t convinced,” said Dr Chua.Typical government mouth piece doctor speaking of his 'professional' opinion which can be proven false by a single liet review. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/The lierature is NOT divided on CBD 'doctor'."
"When he said literature is divided, it means there are people on both sides of the debate.Did you just post one single article, uphold it as the only truth, and dismiss everything else as false?And if you scroll down at the link you provided, you can see the article is sponsored by http://eiha.org ?I don't even care about the cannabis debate, just surprised by your sweeping statement."
"Ok i admit that there might be a conflict of interest, but a simple google search return this: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.who.int/medicines/access/controlled-substances/CannabidiolCriticalReview.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwizjsGL_7zgAhUKRo8KHX53CpIQFjAJegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw2-qpJyQ4oh2xkIgMydgBSo&cshid=1550208213869Do you still think experts are divided on CBD? Of course they are not! This Dr Chua is throwing smoke bombs like climate change deniers, claiming 'oh experts are still divided'; they are not. Read the WHO report and tell me what you think."
"Dude, did you just post another single article to dismiss the existence of the other side again? My previous post isn't saying you are wrong, but telling you that you shouldn't do that sort of thing.That's like people posting one climate change denier article, and say that experts all deny climate change.Like I said, I'm not that interested in the cannabis debate. The way you present your argument, dismiss the opinions of others and insist all experts agree with you is... not very convincing.I was leaning towards medical cannabis legalisation is good, but after reading your comment, it makes me hesitate... am I really going to trust the side that uses such irrational logic?And finally, if you are going to use 'a simple Google search' as your argument, state the words you used."
"Dude did you even read rhe link. It is by WHO. You can't get more impartial than that.If you are truely impartial and logical like you claimed to be, my insistence on the evidence of the benefits of CBD should not sway your support for legalisayion of cannabis, unless of course my insistance touched your sore spot.I am insisting that the evidence is overwhelming that CBD is gd and should be legalised. There are no 2 sides to it; just like there are no 2 sides to climate change or vaccination benefits. If you have taken time to understand this debate like you did for climate change (which i supposed you did), then you will see what i said is right and just.Now read the WHO recommendation first before replying to me."
"These articles often say literature has demonstrated the harm cannabis can do. It's not often that they mention that there are arguments on both sides, which is true. Give them props for that.""experts aren't convinced"", though, isn't true. That depends on what factors they're looking at. For example, there's consensus that smoking weed when too young causes harm later in life. On the other hand, there's consensus on the use of cannabis for certain illnesses."
Highlight the importance of government scholarship / subsidies. You can get people to sign off in whatever you want....
Now Saturn can be spotted in the sky. Just a small speck tho. With naked eye.
Yes! It’s one of the brighter planets seen here in SG other than Venus mars and Jupiter
Looks like straight out of MS Paint haha
That's exactly how Saturn looks like when viewing through a telescope lol
How come west side always got this cookie smell in the air?
Khong Guan factory
I can't decide if it's true or if you're trying to give me a funny answer to my cookie description.
"Not exactly sure it’s true either but that’s the only biscuit factory I know around that might be causing it , but I do smell chocolate more often,Side thought - what if this was all to mask the more potent smells released by factories further west 😱"
What kind of cookie smell? There's always a chocolate smell near boon lay/pioneer because of the Cadbury factory.
"I believe it's a ""chocolate"" smell. There's a Cadbury factory in Boon Lay. Source"
There’s this chocolate smell as well

There’s an adaptor that clamps the mobile on the eyepiece of the telescope
"omni xlt 127 with 25mm eyepiece. Stacked with autostakkert.What do these do and how much are they? You think any random person can use this as a ""telescope alternative""?"
"It’s a Schmidt cassegrain telescope. Bought it from the shop at science centre, gift from my Wife cos I like astronomy but just beginner"
Nice! Would love to invite anyone interested in the night sky to the woodland galaxy cc astronomy club or any of the poly astro club
Wow! Yeah we have the Friday night viewings at the omni theatre in the west too
"Hi! kinda random, but my fiance and I are visiting singapore in june for a couple of days. If there is stargazing, how would I know and would i be able to visit? Thanks! (we will be there from a monday to wednesday)"
"There is a few place that you might interestedScience center Singapore (sessions every friday) linkWoodland Galaxy CC (sessions on friday and saturdays) They are located in the north, walking distance from Admiralty Train station. Im sure you can find with a quick google search.Those are the ones with an observatory, if you just want to stargaze, chilling at any of the beach would be a great experience."
awesome! thank you!
Been thinking of heading to the woodlands club or science centre to start stargazing for a long time now but havent been able to haizHow many people generally go to the woodlands club to stargaze?
For the woodlands one it’s usually around 10 to 15 mostly RP kids
Hi JayZ
I have a cheap astromaster
"Use p1000, image will be much more clearer"
"hi, where is best place to buy this telescope in singapore"
"Mine was bought from the omni theatre shop, they have many models. I Guess you can go find out from there , from 200 bucks to 5 or 6 figure set ups"
"Great thanks for the info, will check it out! great pic btw, my son said it looks like a cartoon planet. lol"
Thanks! It’s one of the better clear sky nights. When my son saw the planet through the telescope he couldn’t beielve his eyes. Opens their perspective on how small we are in this universe and brings humility.
well said :) and agree
Btw P1000 is a super zoom camera not a telescope
Nice one. r/astrophotography
Also interested to know how your setup looks like.
I thought I was still loading the picture and my phone was lagging! Nice pic tho
Hahahah! Good one . It was that small through The Eye piece too.
Nice shot! May I ask which part of the West did you take this from?
"Corporation road, along the drive way behind my block."
"Planets don't get affected by the light pollution, except when you have clouds."
You're absolutely correct but people are downvoting you anyways. One easy way to tell that light pollution doesn't affect planets is that planets look like really bright stars even when there's a lot of light outside drowning out the actual stars so the planets end up being the only 🌟 you see in the sky.Venus is called the morning Star and it would be the only 🌟 you can see after the sun has come up.http://gnosticwarrior.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Jupiter-and-Venus.jpg
Thanks for backing me up. The down votes show just how common this misconception is.
It drowns out the light reflecting off the planet.
It mostly just decreases the contrast of the planet and the surrounding sky. I would say that seeing is a bigger factor for planetary observation.
"Doesn't it still make it harder for cameras to capture planets and stars?The lights drowns out some of the light coming off them, reducing the contrast and making it harder to differentiate from the background on camera."
"Yup, but this effect for planets is largely negligible due to their high surface brightness. For nebulae and faint fuzzies it's absolutely a factor."
"Wow, that's pretty amazing. Nice shot man"
Now waiting for the legit sg astrophotographers to start farming karma on r/sg haha
xpost to r/hailcorporate
"From Singapore, you'd be lucky to see even 1 star.Edit: I don't understand the downvotes. This is the actual reality here.Singapore has the highest amount of light pollution in the world, and it's still increasing."

Pretty standard and not what you’re here for, so I’ll share something from 2007, back when I was in JC.On February 14, two friends (Steve and Law) and I (Paul) decided, apparently completely at random, to hang out after school somewhere in town (we’re all guys). This was planned several days in advance and back then, we weren’t the kind to notice dates, occasions and the like, which in hindsight may have been why we were single then. All went well until the morning of, when Steve got detention for a reason that I now forget. We were all bros, but not to the extent that we’d hang around school till 5.30PM just waiting for detention class to end, so it was decided that we’d head to town first, then let Steve know our whereabouts when he was done.Off we went.All through the bus trip and while we were walking in town, I noticed several funny looks cast in our direction. More than once, especially by older people, those looks were decidedly dirty. Why? I didn’t say anything to Law, but discreetly patted myself up and down. My hair was in place, my uniform buttons were done properly and my fly was up. I’d managed to adult properly that day. Yet the looks persisted. The penny dropped as I checked the date on my watch. It was February 14: Valentine’s Day. Law and I, two dudes walking around chatting and laughing, were being mistaken –and judged- for being an openly gay couple prancing around, or so they thought, all around Orchard Road in school uniform. Such immorality! Shame!I pulled Law aside and explained the situation. Turns out he’d realised what was happening almost as soon as I had and was just as annoyed as I was over the whole thing. On the fly, we both came up with something that was both uniquely in character for our witty/sardonic/bitchy personalities and absolutely hilarious.Law sprouted a fire and several camping chairs while I generated a tent, sleeping bags and food supplies. In other words, we went Camp. Putting on a Valley Girls’ accent complete with lisp, he caught me by the arm and raising his voice enough to be audible for several metres around went, “Paul, darling, shall we go to Cathay and take in a movie? We have some time to kill before we can check in, and it’s getting so hot out here!” I looked him in the eye, put an arm around his waist and replied, “Lead the way, baby,” at equal volume.The cinema was full. The movie (Jumper, I think) was bad. More looks began to be directed at us. Law and I played a happy couple. The looks soon came accompanied with sound effects. We fed each other popcorn. I let my arm drift over his shoulders. More “tsks.” I caught the eye of a particularly disturbed looking middle-aged gentleman. He glared at me. I nudged Law and we both looked at him, looked at each other and smiled. His look changed from displeasure to discomfiture and he avoided eye contact throughout the rest of the movie, shuffling in his seat every time one of us looked his way. The movie ended. The people sitting near us, including that gentleman, made themselves scarce as soon as the credits started rolling. We went to find Steve, who had managed to reach town by then. He found our story hysterical. We hung around a bit more, then had dinner and went our separate ways.All of us are straight. Steve is married to a woman and has 1.5 kids now, Law has been engaged for the past year and will be married at the end of the year and I’ve only dated and been attracted to women. But for that one afternoon, we began to realise what discrimination and judgement felt like, and in some ways that day can be marked as the time our minds began to broaden. So, to me at least, Valentine's Day is not just one I celebrate with my SO, but is also a day I remember as having learned a significant life lesson."
"Steve is married to a woman and has 1.5 kids nowDamn, hope his kids are okay."
Perhaps he meant to say Steve's wife is pregnant with their 2nd child.
I liked your joke.
"Steve and his wife are expecting their second child. She's about 20 weeks along now, so they're literally at that halfway point."
HAHAHAHA Ok This is a punch line
I love this story so much! Also love the fact that you guys were comfortable enough in your own skin/sexuality to do something like that. I think not many guys (especially at that JC going age) would have been so.
"I think it was more looking for creative ways to stick it to the haters than being comfortable in our sexuality. I'd imagine no one's really comfortable in their own skin at that age... But okay, I'll take that as a compliment. 😁"
this is way underrated man... props to your acting!!!

"What a way to learn a lesson, never thought to do this. Thanks for sharing!"
But did u say no homo
"I've never needed to periodically remind myself of my own sexuality, so nope."
That was an amazing story. Thanks for sharing.
Glad you liked it. Nothing like having a good story to tell sometimes. :)
Spent my valentine’s day with a super handsome muscular man.Went on a date on an island.We then started by pushing the floor as he said “20 counts of 4”
I suppose he also asked u to touch the tree
This one specifically cannot already la
What do you mean cannot?
Cannot tell chao recruit to touch tree then come back. At least for nsf commanders la.
But can touch tree and come?
You want touch tree so much and come you ownself go touch la.
touch his tree?
"My boss complains about how his wife rejected his intimacy attempts this morning and decided not to send her flowers this year. Instead, he is treating us to her wife's favourite prawn noodle later for lunch and he is planning to take photo to spike her. LOL. As for me, still hoping a miracle will happen with the remaining hours in the day that I will find that someone to spend valentines day with (and the rest of our valentines)."
I think you meant spite? Unless he means to poison her?! 😱

"Sounds like a good way to not get any sex for awhile. Although I hate couples where the girl believes they are ""giving"" the guy sex. Either the guy is bad or she chopped off her clitoris."

"A bug came into my dorm room at uni earlier, just as I woke up. I'm deathly afraid of it, but I didn't want to kill it.It was timidly hiding behind the curtain, then under my desk and my desk drawer. It was being a stupid old bug, sometimes flying towards the light, but resorted to the curtains and desk most of the time.I was thinking of boxing it and releasing it into the wild, but me being afraid af, I was hesitating the entire time.Then the bug started crawling along the wall. It could fly, but now it was just crawling along the wall, as if not to alarm me. And after spending 20 minutes by my curtain and desk, it headed for the door.It was probably afraid, but I bet it also knew I was afraid. It wanted to get out of there for the betterment of both of us. I held the door open for it to leave. The bug being a stupid bug, it kept on running into the open door.But then it found the opening. And it crawled to its freedom.I don't have any valentine, boy or girl. But that bug cooperated with me. I was afraid of it, it was afraid of me, but we somehow worked together for its freedom. Thank you, weird bug I am afraid of. I luv ya. <3And happy valentines guys."
"Got together with my girlfriend on 14 Feb 2018. Been exactly a year since then. We both acknowledged that tonight will be crowded almost everywhere so we will just meet up for a simple dinner. We will meet again on 17 Feb as a belated celebration and we will bring each other to a surprise lunch (planned by me) and dinner (planned by her).I gave her roses last year and while she appreciated it, she told me not to buy flowers again because it's a waste of money. So I bought her something much more practical and useful for her this time."
"Not a Valentine's story, but yeah, my boyfriend told me that he regretted getting together with me on 31 Dec/1 Jan. Basically at the stroke of midnight. He pulled out all the stops that night & it really was super romantic at that time, what with the fireworks & everything, but we have both mellowed out over time & over the top celebrations are no longer our thing.Thing is, we still wanna celebrate on our anniversary itself but it's become a bitch to plan since everywhere is so crowded & so damn expensive that we just dont celebrate our anniversary anymore. It really doesnt matter to us that we cant, but the boyfriend said he has learnt his lesson & insists that our future wedding must be held in a month without any public holidays so that our wedding anniversaries can be celebrated within a low peak period LOL."

"Nothing special, she's not my gf (yet) but we're planning to have zichar at a place where we used to go as JC students (not with her as we didn't know each other existed back then) for some nostalgia, and probably for a walk thereafter.Simple and easy, we're getting older. Haha"

"Anyone knows where in SG they can help you inflate the balloons? I plan to buy some of the balloons online, but since I have no helium tank is there any stores that will fill up the balloon for you at a lower charge (since I’m not getting the balloon from them, just the helium.)Thanks in advance!"
"Rent the helium tanks from party suppliers (such as the ones near Bugis junction or peoples park Centre). They will charge a deposit, and a 60$- 90$ charge for a tank that fills up 70 - 100+ latex balloons. Has worked well for me in the past."
artbox or SKP has balloon inflating services.
You can get a small disposable tank of helium for $50-$60 I think. You should be able to fill up a goodly amount of balloons.
"Shops which sells helium balloons (eg. party supplies shop, florist) should provide helium filing services as well. I have tried asking before at a shop in Northpoint but ended up buying a hand pump as I was told that my 36 inch confetti balloon was too big. I had a hell lots of fun when we burst the balloon though."
Only because they know people will abuse the fuck out of it. I remember when Microsoft launched OneDrive and offered unlimited storage. Then people decided to backup their entire drama collection taking up terabytes and the offer was killed.This is why we can't have nice things.
Same like singtel unlimited data. 50GB at 4G speed. After that slow like fk. But how often are you gonna use until 50GB.
Live stream nba
"They said unlimited data, not unlimited 4G data. Moreover, 1Mbps is still sustainable except for streaming HD videos. If you really need more, get a tourist SIM at $15 for 100GB for 7 days.At least they stated it upfront instead of hiding in the fine print."
And? There's still no limit to the amount of data you can use so it is perfectly fair to call it unlimited.
Give customers extra benefit also complain. There is literally no downside to this change.
"Better than nothing though, no?"
"""Fair use"" is the name given by the operators in France. He exists for 2 main reasons. First is for not satured bandwidth in dense areas ( netflix,YouTube, etc..are bandwidth eaters). Second: without ""fair use"", you break internet home market since you can use your phone as a modem. Nobody will subscribe for internet if you could use your phone for internet/TV provider. With this separation, operators earn much money with 2 subscriptions: phone + home."
"Full speed for the original 20GB allocation, they simply removed the boosting requirement if you want to continue using data after that. Interesting though."
"It's not unlimited still. The terms say that after using 20GB the speed will become ""managed"". Which means it will reduce to dialup or 2G speeds. I have faced this issue with circles one day unlimited packs."
"its actually quite common in america, no idea how common it is in singapore. but basically i have unlimited but LTE only runs for 6gb, afterwards it becomes 4g"
LTE and 4g is the same thing
"It's a bunch of confusing labeling. In the US, phones will display ""LTE"" for LTE and ""4G"" for HSPA+. In Singapore, ""4G"" is displayed when connected to LTE.Was very confused when I bought a SIM card in SG while visiting my parents and my phone only every displayed ""4G"". Thought that my phone didn't have the correct LTE bands."
"Interesting, Google Nexus and Pixel devices show ""LTE"" not ""4G"" here."
Fair use for unlimited on Circles is 100GB
"Joke's on them, 3g4lyfe"
"The end of the giant jets also reflects a victory for the point to point model of aviation. The A380 reflected the hub and spoke model of aviation where people flew into hubs to get to their destination. But with newer planes being able to fly for longer distances, there’s not much of a need to make a connection if you can fly directly."
"Alas, we see that long haul budget aviation is still unfeasible. True, premium long-haul is gaining popularity, but it caters to a segment of the market only. The other half, leisure travellers, tend to look at price and that's where long haul hub and spoke model wins.Norwegian is trying long haul budget and I was a huge supporter. But for them, not only was it infeasible due to us being a different market (how many people know Norwegian exists?), it was also hard because if there is a delay, there's not going to be a replacement craft available. Scoot is having problems here too.I forsee SIA and other airlines still having to make connecting flights far into the future for mainstream use."
I think they didn’t want to devote any efforts into marketing. I didn’t even see a single ad on them save for a write up by Yahoo.
"When it comes to planes, big is clearly not better.On Sept 30, 1968, the world got its first glimpse of the Boeing 747, as the jumbo jet with its distinctive hump rolled out of a factory in Everett, Washington.It was dubbed Queen of the Skies, a title it eventually gaveup almost four decades later to the Airbus 380 - an even bigger flying machine designed to carry as many as 555 passengers in a three-class configuration or 853 passengers in a single-class economy configuration.On Oct 25, 2007, Singapore Airlines (SIA) became the first to fly the A-380 commercially - from Singapore to Sydney.Twelve years later, the B-747 and A-380, built to transport large numbers of air travellers acrossmajor airports, have become irrelevant to passenger airlines.Orders have stagnated, while those still flying are slowly but surely being phased out.The skies now belong to smaller, more efficient flying machines that come with two instead of four engines that power the bigger birds.And while big airports that can accommodate the giant jets continue to grow, travellers are increasingly opting for point-to-point services instead of having to fly through major hubs. This fuels the need for smaller aircraft.Is this the end of the runway for jumbo jets?A GOOD RUN FOR THE B-747When American chief engineer Joe Sutter and his team at Boeing sat down in the 1960s to design the B-747, they set out to build an aircraft that could be used both as a passenger carrier and a cargo plane.Convinced that the future of passenger flights belonged to supersonic aircraft, the team was prepared that the B-747 could one day be good only for cargo services.With this in mind, the plane was designed with a flip-up nose, hinged at the top to make it easy to load and unload even large cargo items quickly.The cockpit got in the way so designers added the iconic hump to house the pilot cabin.From its first commercial flight in 1970, the B-747 went on to become a big hit with more than 1,500 jets built to date.""It's all about timing"", said aviation analyst Shukor Yusof from Endau Analytics.""The B-747 came at a time when intercontinental long-haul travel was about to take off... There was no competition when it was launched and jet fuel was relatively inexpensive, which made the four-engined aircraft a viable proposition for airlines.""Half a century later, though, the B-747 is starting to disappear from the skies as SIA, Qantas, British Airways, Lufthansa and other major carriers phase them out in favour of newer twin-engined and more efficient planes like the A-350 and B-777s.SIA operated its last B-747 flight in 2012, Qantas says it will phase out its remaining 747s by 2020 and British Airways will do the same by 2024.Last year, Boeing received just 18 orders for its jumbo jet; the bulk from logistics giant UPS, which bought 14 freighters.A-380 NEVER REALLY HAD A FIGHTING CHANCENotwithstanding its glorious entry into commercial service in SIA colours, the A-380 could not have made its debut at a worse time.Professor Guido Gianasso, academic director of the Iata-Nanyang Advanced Management Programme at Nanyang Technological University's Nanyang Business School, said: ""Its introduction into service coincided with the global financial crisis and the hardest times in the history of commercial aviation.""Several technical issues also emerged over the years, from problems with its Rolls-Royce engines to cracks in wing fittings.Last year alone, close to 80 A-380 international flights were cancelled due to technical problems, Prof Gianasso pointed out.High fuel prices in the last decade, which coincided with increasing competition among global carriers for market share and profits, also worked against the viability of the four-engined giant.Some analysts even say that Airbus got it wrong, right from the start.""The commercial assumptions behind the launch of the A-380 have proved wrong,"" said Prof Gianasso.Superjumbos rely on transporting large numbers of passengers between major hub airports like Changi, Dubai and Heathrow, from where they would connect to smaller airports.Unfortunately for Airbus, travellers increasingly prefer to fly direct to their destinations, which typically requires smaller aircraft.In addition, passengers - particularly in first and business class - also expect a spread of departure times to suit their needs.""The market has given its verdict,"" said Prof Gianasso, noting that A-380 sales have stagnated.Airbus said on its website that as at Jan 31, it had received 313 orders for the aircraft, with 234 planes delivered - leaving a backlog of about 80 A-380s.That number has since dropped after Qantas announced last week that it had cancelled an outstanding order for eight A-380s.A further slide seems imminent, with talk that Emirates - which still has more than 50 A-380s on order - is looking to convert some of that to the smaller and more efficient A-350.It is not good news for Airbus, given that the Dubai-based carrier, the biggest A-380 operator with about 110 of the giants, is possibly the only airline customer keeping the A-380 programme alive.Airbus, which has cut its production rate for the A-380 to just eight aircraft per year from this year onwards, seems determined to keep the factory going for the next few years at least.Perhaps it is stubbornly holding out for a miracle, a renewed interest in the giant jet.Sadly, there seems to belittle, if any, hope that the plane-maker, which spent about US$25 billion (S$34 billion) to develop the aircraft, will ever come close to recouping the amount.With just one real customer in Emirates, it is unviable for the A-380 programme to continue for much longer.In 2007, Airbus made history when president and chief executive officer Tom Enders officially handed over the first A-380 - the biggest passenger plane ever to be built - to launch customer SIA.The grand event attended by more than 500 guests was held at Airbus' delivery centre in Toulouse, France.In April this year, Mr Enders will retire, paving the way for Airbus (commercial aircraft) president Guillaume Faury to take over.Pulling the plug on the production of the much-loved but economically unviable A-380 programme would be a good way to go.The good news for travellers is that the A-380s and B-747s already flying will continue to soar through the skies for many years to come."
Singapore--Beijing for CNYSingapore - Saudi Arabia for the Haj?Singapore - Australia for the holiday season? I took SG - Melbourne
"They would first have to convert the 747s and A380s to Business-Economy only, and then only break them out during peak seasons. This requires a bit more sophisticated logistics than running a bus terminal, especially since airlines do not actually own the terminal, the airport does."
Not unexpected.The primary determinant of operating cost is fuel prices; and the primary selling point to customers is not so much comfort or speed but also cost - otherwise business class would be the standard seating arrangement.Take a look at this video for a reasonably good explanation.
Airbus has just ceased production of A380.
"Point to point FTWthough honestly the 787 is not exactly a ""small"" airliner..."
"With the retirement of the A380, I'll never have my chance to fly in a suite."
No it is still a important aircraft
"The reason why airlines are seeking to get rid of it is that they have trouble filling most of them to capacity. This means there's a large profit loss when running them, as compared to, say, a long haul single decker like a 787.Gas prices have affected airline preferences and designs. The 70s saw the rise of the 747 over Concorde-like designs and performance for reasons of fuel economy, which is why there were only ever 2 supersonic passenger craft in operation (and I'm not sure about the Russian Concorde copy). Unless we make aircraft run on alternative fuels, it's very likely that airline preferences for daily drivers will change based on the price of fuel again; that, and the average passenger's finances that would limit the amount of times he can buy an air ticket."
"The Tu-144 ""Concordski"" was a massive failure from the outset. Unlike the Concorde, the Tu-144 was not capable of supercruise (cruising at supersonic speeds) and had to use very fuel-hungry afterburners for the entire flight. Considering that the supercruise-capable Concorde sucked up a lot of fuel per passenger, this was a massive fail for the Tu-144.The economics of the USSR was not amenable to such a high cost passenger aircraft anyway: Aeroflot was unable to sell tickets expensive enough to defray the cost of operating the only Tu-144 flight from Moscow to Alma-ata (now Almaty, Kazakhstan) while British Airways and Air France were able to market Concorde flights for the super rich jetsetters who wanted to be in the bleeding edge of technology and speed.Finally the Tu-144 was plagued with technical failures, partly attributable to intentional sabotage by Concorde designers who found out that the Russians were copying their schematics and baited the spies with intentionally wrong schematics."
"The Tu-144 crashed during an air show when they tried to show that their plane was better than a Concorde, pushing the plane beyond its flight envelope."
Such a compelling argument
anyone has any recommendation on what I could do?
Go sign up for volunteer at NLB and look for double hours events. Can easily get 100 hours during march holidays if you do 8 hours for 7 days on double hours.
Go sch library help out.Help out in chingay????
For what tho? NYAA?
Yup
"join events that lasts for a few months, examples are Chingay and NDP, or even those type of marathons like Standard Charterd. All require training and registration months prior but the point is that the VIA hours for such events are really good, could be 50++ hours to even 100 if im not wrong and most of the time these events are really fun too. just google volunteer events 2019 bah and you should be able to find some.alternatively, join volunteer organisations like Heartware Network or People’s Association where you can volunteer for short events like Istana Open House or stuff like that."

"tl;dr: do not ever turn on mobile data on a prepaid card - there's a chance you'll get charged $4 or more per MB with no cap if you're not careful.I know most of you reading this will have postpaid plans - I do too - but this is a story about my father, who sticks to a prepaid plan because he doesn't use his phone much.My father accidentally drained his entire $100 prepaid Starhub account in 25 minutes this afternoon. His phone is a hand-me-down from 2013 that has 4G capabilities, but he doesn't usually use data on his prepaid SIM, so he never bothered buying a data bundle. However, when he topped up his prepaid last month, Starhub gave him 500MB of free data, so he turned on 4G on his phone.Today before going out he forgot to turn 4G off, and ended up using 25MB of data - a tiny amount by any standard measure (the r/singapore front page is 1.14MB), but without a data bundle Starhub charged him $100 at 4 cents per 10kb. That's $4000 per GB, compared to [$11 per GB you pay][2] with a prepaid data plan. The price is so expensive that nobody in their right mind would use this service, but that's what StarHub charges (the other telcos charge similar rates). There was no alert or notification, and no cap on the amount used. We only noticed his balance was empty when he tried to make a call and couldn't.We called StarHub customer service, and the customer support rep sheepishly explained that this daylight robbery was perfectly legit, but in the end we managed to get $50 back. These prices were probably set when StarHub only had 2G services, and 1MB was an incredible amount of data, but these days phones can use 25MB in a blink of an eye. I wouldn't be writing this if the rate was 2x or even 10x the data bundle rate, but 400x is absolutely insane. I feel like accidentally forgetting to tap out on the bus and getting charged $100 for my bus ride.I don't know how to prevent this from happening again. Android's data limiter doesn't help because I can't set an expiry date on the mobile data usage. The customer support rep ""helpfully"" suggested that we purchase a data bundle, but if the bundle expires we'll be charged at 400x the price again.Sorry about this rant, I just want to get it off my chest.[2]: http://www.starhub.com/personal/mobile/mobile-phones-plans/prepaid-cards/data-add-on-plans/prepaid-data-plan.html"
"That happened with my mother a couple months ago, lost $50+ stored value in less than a minute.She's not tech-savvy and I wasn't keen on spending hours to explain to her the differences between cellular data and Wi-Fi so I just disabled cellular data and told her that her usual YouTube usage would zap up all the value on her prepaid card instantly so she can only watch her fluffy animal videos at home where there's Wi-Fi.Somehow, she accidentally enabled cellular data again and was showing her phone to me, cheekily saying I was lying to her about 'no internet' (yes that was my lazy explanation to her) outside with a beaming smile. By the time I disabled cellular data, she had less than a dollar on the prepaid card. A lesson learnt, but we had a good laugh out of it.Android's data limit helps in my case since she doesn't plan on using data at all so I can just set it to 0."
"The difference between wifi and cellular data is one of the hardest things for me to explain to my mom, sigh."
"ELI70 version:WiFi is like drinking from home tap water, cheap and abundant.Cellular data is like drinking from bottled mineral water. Expensive and limited."
"This is great analogy. I struggled w telling my dad to not use data outside of home, telling him the same thing as OP but when he showed me his phone somehow mobile data is on again. He said his colleagues turned it on for him."
"""Boy, then you just refill the bottle mineral water again with tap water from toilet lah! Free mah!"""
"That would be called Starbucks WiFi.It's still water, but not the kind you would want to drink."
"I use the symbols on the phone. The wifi symbol means ""internet at home"" and data symbol means ""internet outside"". Only watch videos if the internet at home symbol is on and has no exclamation mark."
That's how my family explained it to my grandparents too!
"My father isn't even ignorant about tech. He taught me programming when I was 12 and has a PhD. He's well aware that he should never use data, and is always extremely careful, which is why I'm so surprised even he got tripped up by this."
"$4000 per GBAt this sort of price where it's 400x of regular price, if you refuse to pay and actually enter in an arbitration case probably you will win.Arbitrator will likely look at whether this service really cost Starhub so much that they need to charge 400x times to make profit which is unlikely so they'll likely push it down to a reasonable 10x max sort of pricing ladder due to ""last min service rendered"" sort of pricing.This principle will likely stand if Starhub sues you in court to enforce payment, so given the low likelihood of winning they'll probably never sue you.However, it is unlikely that individual consumers will be able to access the proper legal channels to fight against this small injustice. Most will just take the 50 dollars discount like OP here (which is still 200x regular price).I don't think Starhub is out trying to be evil - they really don't depend on such shit to boost their revenue because they are generally rare instances. However without people challenging them there is very little incentive for them to correct these old pricing systems that is clearly obsolete and downright predatory in certain instances."
"It’s prepaid, so Starhub already has our money. I’m trying to push him to use the $0 contract now, but change is hard. I would encourage anyone else in this thread who’s on prepaid to do the same - the only way to get these companies to change is to vote with your wallet."
Why is your dad so insistent on using prepaid?
"He's not in Singapore for half the year, and he's usage when he's here is low enough that it's cheaper than the lowest postpaid tier."
"It’s prepaid, so Starhub already has our money.It's not recognized as revenue until you spend it.But like I said, I don't think Starhub is purposely trying to eat your money.the only way to get these companies to change is to vote with your wallet.Pretty sure legacy telcos all have same problem."
"Pretty sure legacy telcos all have same problem.Circles.Life's $0 plan seems like the solution. The data will automatically top up at a reasonable rate if you exceed the limit. I'm on their $28 plan and am happy with it so far, so I'll try to get him to switch."
"Yeah, which is why I said legacy telcos."
Wow this is absolutely ridiculous of them to actually charge that much for data in 2019 actually. Sidenote maybe you can actually consider the circlelife $0 plan for your dad?
"I looked it up, and it looks really good except porting a prepaid number means converting to Starhub postpaid first, which looks like a pain in the ass. Might still be worth it though - I'll talk to him."
"Sounds like a good plan, -> postpaid -> port to circles. Circles also have free WhatsApp voice call and 100mins. Theres currently no app for data auto limit, I would love to have such an app too. I developed a habit to on and off data each time I enter the lift and use a data manager to track data usage."
"Android has a data limiter built in. The problem is that StarHub's free data expires 7 days after topping up, and Android can't be set to automatically shut off data after 7 days. But really this entire discussion is ridiculous - $4000 per GB is just ridiculous."
"😲 I totally forgot about that feature, thanks!I wonder if you can make a small claims tribunal against star hub? Since 4000/GB is an unreasonable amount by today's standards, despite it being perfectly legit for them to do so in their book. 🤔"
They already got $50 back. I don't think it's worth the effort for getting the other $50.
"since your dad doesn't use phone often as you said, it might be less of a hassle to just a new number entirely and let people on your dad's contact list know that he changed number?"
"the circles life $0 for 1gb plan doesnt require porting? i got it with a new number from circles.edit: oh u mean u wan to remain w yr number, ok lol u can get a dual sim phone and just use the 1gb plan for data"
"Similar to how credit card companies work, they consider this as a form of revenue"
Prepaid mobile data from telcos in Singapore are particularly scummy. They won't notify in whatever way that you've used up your prepaid mobile data quota and instead continue to charge you at that ridiculous per MB/KB rate
"Legit happened to me last week and I had no clue what was going on. I'm only out here for a few months so went with a pre-paid card with $30 dollars and a data plan that I'd thought I'd use to buy another once the month was over/ran out.Went from the ""you've ran out of data text"" to $0 dollars on the account before I'd finished reading the message"
"Same thing happened to me, but it was $10. I have topped up $10 and was about to buy the data bundle when i realized the money had gone from data ‘leaking’. I called Singtel, explain my situation and got back the $10."
"Okay, as crappy as this is - there is a way around it. I use pre-paid myself (27M here, just for reference).I am not sure about Starhub, but Singtel has all these plans ranging from $10-$28 which cover X00 minutes of calls and Y00 SMSes plus Z MB of data. Good thing is, these plans have a separate 'account', so when you top-up the amount doesn't go into your main account where it can be spent on anything (including data). So, regardless of where you are and what you do, you will never run out of balance unless you use it for its dedicated purpose.This even helps with roaming data charges. And this is why I still use pre-paid > there is always a cap to what I get billed on, and with auto top-ups, it is almost as seamless as post-paid."
"I'm an extremely light user since I don't use social media except perhaps reddit. A few years back, I was under the impression that prepaid cards were the thing for me since i hardly ever hit the data, sms or calls limit of most post paid contracts.However these days with the rise of cheap data plans like zero 1 or myrepublic's unlimited data plans, they are much more worth it to use than prepaid. I managed to get the $8 myrepublic unlimited data and I'm really happy. It even comes with a thousand monthly sms and call time.The landscape of data plans now is very different from what it was a year or two ago. Many are actually affordable now, and prepaids are no longer the cheapest option."
"I use a Singtel Prepaid card, this story is pretty much what will happen if you don't buy a data plan for your card. I have to be careful whenever my plan expires that I straightaway buy another plan after midnight. But sometimes you can forget and all the money you topped up is gone. I think the most I lost was about $60 as I was anticipating buying the data plan. Nowadays I just top up enough to buy a $30 plan. If they allow prepaid numbers to switch to postpaid, I'll do it in a heartbeat."
They do allow prepaid to switch to postpaid. Just not the other way.
"Was on Singtel prepaid for a long time, a lpt I can give to others is that any leftover data from your previous plan will transfer over.Say you bought a $30 5GB plan. You used 4GB. Before the 30 days ends, if you buy the $10 1GB plan, you'll get 2GB instead for the next 30 days."
Happened to my maid as well. Got her a zero1 card right after.
Not the first time of data leakaged happened a few years ago I was using an S3. Was I'm class and the battery was removed yet the the data just went off the charts and ate all my monies. The same prepaid line also just had money disappeared for no reason. Thank God now I have post paid
"Ah ha ha ha, isn't Starhub the one with the""Time to admit we all hate Telco """" We promise to be different #Change ""Commercial blasted all over?The irony is uncanny, or rather the bigotry."
man..this happened to me a few years ago when i was still using prepaid. told my friend about it and he was unconvinced data could cost this much (opened instagram by accident for 1 second and all my money was gone).
Prepaid seems to have very inconsistent pricing. On postpaid plans extra 1GB blocks are $10.70/month? In this day and age why is exorbitant pay-as-you-use rates still a thing?
I experienced this before too. Luckily my prepaid stored value was only $18. So I dont lose as much.
I once lost $36 in less than 15min back when I was using prepaidKinda sux
"I don't see why you don't purchase a data bundle since your dad does use data. He can buy it when he gets to Singapore. There are usually a lot of options depending on his usage needs.I'm with Singtel and Circles prepaid, and I noticed for Singtel, you don't get a notification if you're using free bonus data. But with a plan, if it is expiring or you're low on data, there is a warning SMS. Circles is nicer, and they give you a low data warning even with the free plan.Forgetting to buy data is a thing, but learn and move on. I've actually saved money with prepaid. Spend less than $10/month, now even less. The one expensive mistake...sometimes it happens. I don't top up $100 for many reasons."
"He doesn’t think the data is worth the money, but since it was free he thought he might as well use it. Have to top up every six months to maintain the number, so $100 is the amount left after a few years (I just learnt in this thread that Starhub has a “value added service” to maintain the line without topping up). And sure, they can charge that amount, but that doesn’t make it right. They do this because they can get away with it and people like us just lan lan suck thumb."
"The info was there the entire time. Not exactly a hidden thing. If you decide to use the service anyway, you have accepted the terms."
LPT: Don't put 100$ on your account
They do this to maintain the number. Prepaid sim will self-cancel after a period.
Real LPT (it's also posted this earlier below): you can buy a VAS to extend it by dialing *123*200#. It's $1.40 per 90 days.
Thanks. Did not see that post until after my earlier message.
contact telco to disable whatever g access on the prepaid.never turn on whatever g.limit the top up amounts. Do you really need 100 dollar balance? Might as well get postpaid. Lowest amount to top up is 8 dollars.
That’s why I planning to get an iPad for my parent and have them use iPad with WiFi on for YouTube and phone just stay with calling and WhatsApp.
Damn. Me & My parents both use postpaid. 4GB data for each of us. But I monitor all their usage cuz if any of their data is about to burst I get an SMS
"Had this happen to my father last year with Singtel, somehow he activated mobile data without realizing it and racked up $180 in data fees without really surfing the net or anything much. We did get the bill lowered after talking to their support but they did claim to disable mobile data usage from their side after he requested it, which didn't happen at all IIRC."
Write in a complaint to CCCS they might work on it
Good one.
"Urgh, this happened to my secondary SIM card as well when its bonus data ran out.IMDA should follow some countries (I think Germany, for one) where people are forced to browse to a landing page and purchase a data plan if they try to access the internet on their cards."
"Starhub gave him 500MB of free data, so he turned on 4G on his phone.Sorry, but I don't understand. StarHub gave him 500MB free, and they still charge him for 25MB? Is the 500MB non-4G?"
Think along the lines of 525mb.
Prepaid data is always purchased or given with an expiry date. Once it expires you’re back to paying $4000 per GB.
Bullshit that its even allowed to use data without a data plan
Data plan is just a concept.You can tap into data if you have the means.Pre paid without data plan is just a form of data on demand.Data plan is just a agreement for you to use up to X amount before charging market rate. You are charge the same amount even if You do not use it.
How long does this 100 last normally? You know my republic had this 8 dollar 1gb 1000 min no contract plan when it first started. Sounds like something like that more worth.
"He never finishes it. Your prepaid balance expires if you don't top it up every 6 months (another ridiculous thing the telcos do), and since he's overseas a lot he just tops up the minimum $15 every 6 months."
Your prepaid balance expires if you don't top it up every 6 months (another ridiculous thing the telcos do)Protip: you can extend it by dialing *123*200#. It's $1.40 per 90 days.
"I can't believe I've never seen this before. I also can't believe Starhub has the guile to call this a 'value added service' that they won't apply automatically. Why yes Starhub, please don't steal all my prepaid credit in my account just because I forgot to top up."
"oh then yeah sounds like prepaids the way to go. Surprising that in this age there are people who dont like 4G, I see even 90 year olds using smartphones these days surfing porn."
Wtf?
Hmm... maybe just consider the cheapest sim-only card for post-paid plan. Most of them is at $20/mth without contract.
"Most of them is at $20/mth without contract.There's Circles.Life Flexi at $0/month ($38 one-time fee, but you need to make sure never to click ""upgrade"" in their app) and Zero1 at $13.90/month ($9.90 for the first 6 months)."
"Just went for a talk about Guardsmen. Currently unsure whether Guards or Commandos are better. Most people will of course say we can’t compare like that because Guards and Commandos are different . However I have heard repeatedly that Commandos are better as they train harder, mentally stronger, does much more than Guards and recieves more respect. They also recieved best combat unit for 12 consecutive years and 29 times. Can someone explain whether this is true or is it just a very biased view on Guards and Commandos. ( I heard Commandos are actually based off navy seals and actually train with them)"
"Nobody really cares but if you want to know the truth, civilians are the best."
"Commando or Guards, both when see MP scared tio charge."
"Never do anything wrong, scared what?"
You think that will stop them? MPs wanted to charge someone because he had a photo of his girlfriend licking a phallic shaped popsicle from Taiwan. Apparently that's considered pornography.
"That MP probably just out of training school and wanted to flex his armband (if it's white colour, definitely is)"
"If is white colour, he haven't even leave training school.Furthermore, that MP can only book, whether fresh out of training school or experienced MP. Getting booked doesn't mean you'll get charged, it's just a way to let your superiors know that you officially did something wrong. Your officers/superiors will be the ones who hand down punishment, if any. That MP can't do anything to you if you did nothing wrong. If some random MP is trying to get you for (supposed) pornography, do explain to your superiors and make sure they know which photograph the MP claimed was porn."
"end of day, still chao nsf"
Guards are Elite Infanteer and Commandos are Light Infanteer with Airborne capability. People from Infantry/Commando/Guards will argue that they train the hardest. Guards does more thing. There is no need to see which one is better because at the end of the day both are under the same crest.
We all serve the same flag.
Username checks out
"Different roles. Anyway, if you believe the army, the commandos are indeed the best - judging from those I've met, it's pretty legit.If you find someone proclaiming ""I'm elite! ELITE!!"", take them with a pinch of salt. NS isn't worth dick-comparing."
"Had the honor of serving both units(as a driver) both in service and reservist. As far as I can tell, there's really not much difference and certainly no 'best' or 'better than x' between the two. They might have their own specialty training here and there otherwise it's pretty similar.If and when there's a crisis, most probably both units will have different objectives hence the difference in skillset training."
Honour huh
Why so negative?
"Does it really matter?Serve 2 years, also have to come back to the outside world and get on with life.People who can't shut up about how amazing they are because of their vocation/rank even after they ORD usually tend to have done nothing else good with their lives."
God this. People who can only talk about NS in conversations really have nothing else going on
"Lol does it matter whether you have an amazing job outside as a civilian? People work as grab drivers, taxi driver and office workers usually talk about how high their pay is or how much free time they have usually have no lives too. Who have a better life unless you can live in sentosa cove? Boring talks from singaporeans."
you wanna sign on?
"Guards-Rapid deployment, coastal assaults.Commandos-Short duration strike missions, special recon missions.Aiyah if you want to sign on its a matter of preference. No need to compare 'better' or not."
"Guards = Heli rapelling. Got Guards tab (can put with your Recon tab if posted to support coy), Khaki beret. ALWAYS READY, READY TO STRIKECommandos = Jump out of airplane, red beret.....Okay I might be a lil bias cuz I was from a guards mono."
"The guards specializing in rapid deployment, heliborne and amphibious operations, manoeuvre warfare and urban combat. Highly mobile, they are the expeditionary spearhead of the Singapore Army.Commando specializes in pre-emptive operations involving small groups of specially-trained soldiers in enemy territory. They are entrusted with two important roles which are strike missions and reconnaissance missions."
Please read this comment before deciding and not compare one train harder or mentally challenging.
"Only way to tell is during war; we pray will never happen. Otherwise, nobody knows how each branch behave when bullets start flying."
"As what you have said, it is hard to compare as the roles of both are different. Guards are loosely modelled after the US air cavalry and marine Corp, and you may sometimes see the Marines.Personally I feel commandos come across as mentally stronger and more 'on', because they want to be there. I think they go through a selection test, no? Guards units assimilate a larger selection of nsfs, and there are many who didn't want to be there (like myself).Some common things:tougher ippt standardsif activated for real, high chance you won't be coming home."
I'm surprised nobody brought up the popular saying that Guards are underpaid commandos and overworked infantries.
"guards fight frontline enemy combatants, commandos target 3rd line enemy storemen and truck drivers, also those best unit competitions is mostly tradition, it doesnt mean jack"
The question is why does it matter?Am commando and don’t give a shit who’s better.

Guards dont get to jump out of a FUCKIN PLANE WITH A PARACHUTE
"They are distinct vocations and carry out different roles. Commandoes sit at the apex of the foot soldier pyramid. Guards are one below. The same applies across Armies around the World.Within this Commando elite category are variations to handle land and sea assaults. They typically work behind enemy lines and handle covert operations and are vetted at a higher grade for security clearance.They also have to pass the most rigorous entry requirements - physical and mental. Within this category our Naval Diving Unit in view of the environment they operate in have the highest demand.Because of the training investment, they also have a different reward and allowance program.I have no doubt that the Guards have done us proud and have an important role to play, any comparison however would not be appropriate as they are not 🍎 to 🍎."
"we all know if they get some disease and cannabis is the answer, they'll be the first to flew oversea to get the treatment."
Shanmugam looks young but he has one of the most old-fashioned views on the cabinet.Too bad he's still part of the 4g leadership. Can't wait for the day he finally retires.
Lol but alcohol and cigarettes are fine
honest question:but why introduce a new potentially addictive drug?why cannot use by using them in medicine only*?
"There are some people who want it available recreationally for smoking. No chance.Then there are some people who want it to be available medically for smoking. No chance.Finally, the last group wants it to be legalized medicines. Sprays, rubs, pills... you name it. No THC to make you high.Government says noooo weeeeddd is badddd without even thinking of the last group.It may not be a cure-all. It may not be a miracle pill.But imagine being a parent of a child, and watching videos and reading articles online of CBD potentially curing seizures in your child, and the price isn’t crazy high. And all the expensive treatments you’ve have been paying for don’t do jack shit. Will you not take a chance?Marijuana WILL upset the medical industry. Once more countries legalize it.Everyone’s just pissed at our govt because they sit there being smug and all, and make no attempt to even try to do some research.Progressive government indeed."
"i see, thanks!:Dhope the govt can srsly move oneven if they dont wish for it to be smoke, at least have them in medicines like jeez"
"For more reading you can google for Charlotte's web (cannabis).Again, the research behind it is lacking and based on anecdotal evidence. But states in the US have been slowly legalizing the use of it."
"When your child gets severe epilepsy, cancer, dementia, or PTSD, dont ask why you dont have access to medical options like those patients in Canada, Australia, Israel, and many other advanced countries.Don't forget, this is a cabinet that took an extra decade to grapple with eveyday smart phones coming installed with cameras, while failing to focus on securing the really important shit like your health records.It took a public outcry and a the loss of a serviceman, for it to install rear view in vehicle cameras when car manufacturers have it as commonly available options.Have you seen how out of touch the damn Straits Times format even is?"
"See also: World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rescheduling cannabis in international law for the first time in history (which was published 5 days before this, and strangely wasn't covered in the article)."
"Hm ... Shanmugam vs scientists and WHO. Who should I believe?From the BMJ article (Feb 5 2019):The World Health Organization has proposed rescheduling cannabis within international law to take account of the growing evidence for medical applications of the drug, reversing its position held for the past 60 years that cannabis should not be used in legitimate medical practice. ...The current scheduling of cannabis is as strict as that for heroin, and the committee believes that keeping cannabis at that level of control would severely restrict access to and research on potential therapies derived from the plant. ...In its review the committee has recommended that cannabis and cannabis resin should be deleted from schedule IV, the most strictly controlled category in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs treaty of 1961. Other cannabis related products should also be rescheduled, it advises. ...The 53 UN countries that are members of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs will decide whether to vote on the recommendations this March or defer the vote to March 2020.Fortunately, right now, Singapore isn't one of those 53 members (PDF list)."
"Hm ... Shanmugam vs scientists and WHO. Who should I believe?Shan is a tad bit dramatic, but they are consistent with each other. Do take a look at the details listed in WHO reporthttps://www.who.int/medicines/access/controlled-substances/Annex_1_41_ECDD_recommendations_cannabis_22Jan19.pdfFollowing consumption of cannabis, the adverse effects experienced include dizziness and impairment of motor control and cognitive function. As a result of the effects on movement and cognition, cannabis use can impair driving. There are particular risks of cannabis use reported for children, such as respiratory depression, tachycardia and coma. The adverse effects of cannabis consumption are similar to those produced by Δ9-THC alone.There are also a number of adverse effects associated with long term cannabis use, particularly increased risk of mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression and psychotic illness. Chronic regular cannabis use is particularly problematic for young people because of its effects on the developing brain.Cannabis can cause physical dependence in people who use the drug daily or near daily. This is evidenced by the onset of cannabis withdrawal symptoms that occur upon abstinence; these symptoms include gastrointestinal disturbance, appetite changes, irritability, restlessness and sleep impairment. Clinical diagnostic guidelines such as DSM-5 and ICD-10 recognize cannabis dependence and other disorders related to cannabis use.The evidence presented to the Committee did not indicate that cannabis plant and cannabis resin were particularly liable to produce ill-effects similar to the effects of the other substances in Schedule IV of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. In addition, preparations of cannabis have shown therapeutic potential for treatment of pain and other medical conditions such as epilepsy and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. In line with the above, cannabis and cannabis resin should be scheduled at a level of control that will prevent harm caused by cannabis use and at the same time will not act as a barrier to access and to research and development of cannabis-related preparation for medical use."
"I agree that cannabis and derivatives such as THC have loads of nasty effects... But they're no worse than opium and derivatives such as morphine/codeine/dextromethorphan, all of which are prescribed in Singapore. Like opiates, I'd support medical prescriptions with cannabis derivatives only consumed under medical supervision, which should lead to lower risks of serious side-effects and addiction.That is also HSA's prevailing stance."
"Below are quotes from that CNA piece. Does it sound at all like Shanmugam/the gahmen is ""consistent"" with WHO or the bulk of scientists?He makes up some sort of Big Pharma conspiracy and dismisses any suggestion that cannabis could possibly have any health benefits as total bullshit. Any scientist or organisation who makes such a suggestion must be in on that grand conspiracy. Fortunately the ruling elite of Singapore are above that.The trend towards accepting cannabis for medical use is driven by the “power of money and propaganda”“To date, there are no studies which have validated the claims of unprocessed or raw cannabis being able to treat medical conditions,”But pharmaceutical companies are pushing a different line for financial gain“The companies, which are interested in making money out of this – really dealing in destruction and death – have found a new way of arguing it.”“Some governments, quite frankly, then also look at the potential tax revenues. Though that’s a bum game, because I think in the states that have legalised, they find that the cost associated with increased health-related problems far outstrip any tax revenues,” he added.The minister described the term “medical cannabis” as a way to “whitewash the whole subject”, and dismissed the case for legalising it as “full of holes” and illogical.“The pharmaceutical companies can’t go out there and say: We want you to buy more drugs, and we want to make more money out of you,” he added.“So they try and persuade you that they’re doing this to your benefit because it’s ‘medicinal’, you see. It‘s bunkum.”"
"For all the focus on cannabis, Ketamine really should be looked at too. It actually has rapid-acting antidepressant effects and is backed by the FDA. Yet, our esteemed IMH won't even consider it. I don't doubt we'll run into the same arguments again for psilocybin - another drug that shows such promise for treatment resistant depression that the FDA granted breakthrough designation to it.Addiction is bad, but certainly manageable in a clinical setting if caught early. See Xanax as a good example. On the other hand, patients without treatment options are denied access to ones that can help because of said addiction risk. Which is actually worse?"
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-02-05/ketamine-could-soon-be-used-to-treat-suicidal-ideationKetamine quite promising in treating suicidally depressed patients
"Agreed that Ketamine and Mushrooms should be looked into but this damn Shanmugam and whoever else is so ignorant and wants to keep their 100% no drug policy.Once we start losing all that sweet medical money to Thailand, only then will the gov't consider it."
which then will be too late
"Already too late, bohdo la."
"This conspiracy game is strong in this one.Then again, he is part of the same G that thinks that WP advocating for e cigs is because they are in big e cig pockets."
"Oh for fuck’s sake, it’s just weed. He’s wound up so tight that if he swallowed some coal he’d shit out a diamond. Maybe he should smoke a joint to relax. There are little old grandmas smoking up a storm here on the West Coast. I should roll him a fat one with some dank Cali Kush, it’ll do wonders for his mood."

"Shouldn't the health minister be the one coming out to comment on this stance? I know the MOH did publish a statement as per the article but I feel like having the law minister repeatedly state his position on this matter just shows what this is really all about, and if anything, which stakeholders carry more weight in shaping the government's position towards the substance.Gan Kim Yong is wading through a swamp of shit these days but this probably goes beyond just helping a brother out"
"btw got mislead by myself a little, he recognises the medical properties of cannabis and their compounds but not the raw material due to the lack of research backing it up"
"The ministries made a distinction between such pharmaceutical products with potential therapeutic uses, and products containing unprocessed or raw cannabis – which, they affirmed, have harmful and addictive effects."

"Hands down the best UI design and control for a battle royale game, and most gameplay mechanics are fun and not too frustrating. PUBG has issues with performance and looks rusty compared to APEX. And APEX is free."
The only good thing I feel about PUBG is how realistic their gun-system is (within popular games anyway). Everything else about it is pretty bad.
oriented around teamplay and very fun . fun as in not raging about losing a very polish ping system. a weapon customise system that is very fluid where each part is shown wheather it fits in your current 2 equip weapons or not. a variety of legends that compliment each other with no legends being op. a vary weapon choice with most weapon being good for the entire game so no like everyone uses the same weapon in every match
Got a hitch from a handsome guy (at least to me) today and he’s not the typical good looking shallow himbo. Wa made my day
it's not too late!! i'm not sure whether he'll receive your text since your ride is already over but you can try messaging him thru the app-generated number
He texted me to confirm the hitch but I don’t really know if I should text him... what if he gets creeped out and never do hitch again hahaha
nooo don't text to ask him out HAHAHA just ask whether you can text him if you need to hitch a ride again in the future!edit: ask for his number in your message!!
never ask him be your valentine?
I think I jolly well know he’s out of my league :(
You miss 100% of the shots you dont take ):
man I suck at these things :( this is why I’m still single this vday
"S'okay. Nothing wrong with being single. (: time hasnt come yet, tis all."
I feel like mine will never come :(
"Theres no need to rush. There are many singles who are having the time of their life, and also many couples who end up in unhappiness and divorce. Take it easy, and find that special someone."
Yes that’s what I tell myself too! Thank you :)

"having a quarter life crisis. majored in a field that i dont really have much interest in. current job is totally not related to degree at all. people and environment are pretty chill at current employment but I dont see a future in this field either. till i can commit to a career path , i'm just fucking my future with each passing day. help la"
"Most people don't end up in a job that is related to their degree. More often than not, it's more so the hard skills that you pick up in the course that matters more than the technical knowledge (obviously, not speaking on behalf of doctors and lawyers here).For example, the data scientists in my fintech firm have a background in... Physics. I have UX designer friends that studied anthropology, and digital marketing friends that majored in psychology.Where are you at and what do you dislike about it? What do you like about it?"
Spent the day alone at home watching The Office.Better than going out. Worth it.
My favourite way of spending any day lol
I see you're a man of culture as well
Most ideal way of spending my weekend
"Hi quick question now that circles life has unveiled its unlimited data plan, is it the most worth mobile data plan by a telco and should i swap from starhub? How was everyone’s experience so far?Edit: and quick add on how do i swap telcos i have been on starhub my whole life"
"If you are on a postpaid plan, just apply to port in to circles and your plan with starhub will automatically terminate once circles is activated. Just make sure you're not in a contract otherwise there will be fees.If you're prepaid, you'll need to convert to a starhub postpaid plan at their store first and then do the above.Circles is the most worth if you use more than 15gb a month."
"Given the choice between Delta and Silkair/SQ to Japan with a fare difference of $150 per person, which would you choose? Torn between trying to save money and wanting to give my mum a good experience for her first ever flight orz"
"Choose better timing and cheaper option.No matter how good the air line is, it is still pretty Crap unless you upgrade seats.More so if you are big size.Food is going to be all the standard pack into trolley and heat up style as well.Of course premium air will almost always comes with usb charging and tv but those ain't necessary good things to have.Edit: saw your other commebt where you seem to be going places. Remember to adjust plans for the slowest and weakest person in the group."
"Which ever flight that suits your timing the best. Must take into account the time you land vs their peak hour thou.I took delta to and fro Narita, it was a good experience! But of course, SQ beats it hands down"
"You should rule out Silkair cause the experience is more like a budget airline.SQ has red eye flights to JP while it’s only day flights for Delta. Personally, I prefer red eye flights as you get a full day in JP when you land. The bad thing is that it’s hard to get a good sleep on the flight (business class FTW but $$$), so most people end up as zombies on day 1."
"Problem is Silkair is the only one flying direct to Hiroshima...My initial plan was SIN-NRT-SIN on Delta for $550 and then with the JR pass take a 6-hour train ride. Checked SQ, they had HND flights starting from $650 - not bad but timing for cheapest fare kinda sucks. Explored a little further and found that Silkair flies direct to Hiroshima which would cut out that long train ride, but adds a bit more ($700)."
"Oh, consider flying into Kansai airport instead. JR West passes will be cheaper for the journey to Hiroshima.SQ is the only one that flies direct there though. From time to time, MH has cheap fares for it."
"Why Hiroshima though? It’s gonna be around $700-900 even if you take the Japanese airlines and transit at NRT/HND. If you don’t, the 7 day JR pass will add on around $400."
"Wanted to maximise the 7-day JR pass but not go too far west, so the plan was to visit Hiroshima for 2 nights, Kyoto for another 4 and then return to Tokyo for the rest of the trip (flying out from Tokyo). But if I start from Hiroshima, I'll probably get individual tickets for long-distance and city passes for short-distance. The Delta plan still comes out cheaper though but it's a lot of time spent on travelling by train."
"If it’s your first trip to JP (I know it’s the case for your mum), I’ll suggest that you focus on a smaller area like Kansai - Hiroshima or Tokyo - Kyoto. Otherwise there will be a lot of travelling, which might be tiring for your mum."
"Oof - fair enough, considering we even wanted to visit Miyajima while in Hiroshima. I'll rethink my plans over the weekend then. Thanks for the advice!"
"Best flight experience would definitely be SQ, but since the flight duration isnt long, wouldnt matter that much"
Was so tired that i walked home from bus stop on auto pilot mode. N became pleasantly surprised when i reached home because i dint rmb myself walking!
Should be shock and worried instead since next time might be wake up dunno where.

"Just finished my walk at the Marina Barrage and I saw a few couples having V day picnic. Some of them were so elaborate as tho the picnic mat was decorated by Martha Stewart. The true test of love is not impressing your date at a fancy restaurant but whether you s/o can endure the mosquitoes and occasional gusty winds.To these couples in the park I salute you, may you live long and prosper."
Perhaps the ambience smoke you saw that accompanied the decor were lit mosquito coils.
shit leh i 166 only
180 for me bc i’m like 175 LOL
damn woman you tall
thanks but i don’t like it HAHAHA
Holy fk taller than me. why u do dis :(

Maybe I should start wearing heels instead of the ladies. Damn.
HAHAHAA quite rare to see people as tall as me
"I stereotypically labelled all tall asians (especially ladies) as future models. I dont know why, it just seems that way to me..."
too ugly to be one oops
I feel your pain :(

178 and above lorI'm 173 so the standard for me is 180
Whats the average internship pay for uni undergraduate in sg?
Depends on the field! I got 1k/mth back in 2016 before CPF.
Depends on the industry itself; $800 isn’t uncommon
So little? My poly intern already $800
"Believe me, I had the same reaction as well. I’ve heard of ones that are real high to me( 1.5k+) and I’ve also heard of unpaid internships (I’m looking at you, US Embassy), so $800+ is pretty much right smack in the middle /shrug"
"Zero is more common than you think. I was shocked myself.It depends on industry, looking at you finance. And companies. Looking at the smaller ones."

(Valentine's Day Aside)Do you think it's a good idea to bring a girl out to Atlas Bar (Parkview Square) on a first date?
No. Don't spend too much on first dates before you even decide if you like her or not.
"If Atlas Bar and other similar establishments are the places you enjoy going to why not? I think it’s good to go on dates to places that reflect your lifestyle habits so the other party can calibrate their expectations. It’s also not too noisy, you can still have a decent conversation and hear each other."
"Depends on your age. Early twenties, don’t. Too much pressure - vibes are too serious for a first date. Middle aged, sure why not? Quite a nice chill place."
Might the opulence induce awkwardness? Or would the classy setting be jarring to typical youths in their 20s?
Setting the baseline there hurhur
"Depends on the girl, how close you are to her, and what kind of image you're trying to send?"
Well been chatting for several months now. Maybe if I were to set a more refined and classy image to her. Would that work?
"well, are you classy and refined?"
"Well I try my best to be haha. I take an interest in classical literary (think Plutarch, Kipling & Fitzgerald) and I refrain from using profanities in my speech. In short i aspire to become a man of considerable means and good standing"
"So I think if it's too drastic a difference she might be turned off? Like if she was attracted to you because you were very grounded and down to earth, she might find it confusing and your plan could backfire, esp if she's also very grounded and down to earth.Conversely, if she's mentioned that she likes refined and classy guys, then it would work great! It's a very nice place after all.Different girls like different things, so it's important to figure out what she, specifically, likes."

"I swear to god, psychiatric medications are such slippery slopes... I have been prescribed quite a small dose, but it's noticeable already. Although I still feel palpitations, they don't travel to my palms anymore. I don't always feel needles all over my neck and back whenever I feel anxious. I can actually perform some things I have never dreamed I'd be okay with doing.I'm not sure if I'm okay with being introduced to such a world. I don't know if I'm okay with having to take a pill every morning to function the way I want to. I feel like it's a crutch or that it's cheating. But at the same time, it's so easy that it makes me uncomfortable."
"Sometimes it does help, and that's a good thing. Of course lots of people would rather not have to take them, but when you need it you need it. I've been off medication for 5 years or more now, but it took a long time to slowly lower the dosage and eventually go without it. Looking back I understand why I hated it, but now that I'm older I also can see how it helped me a lot. Some might say it's just a placebo effect but I can only speak from experience.Don't take it too negatively. It's part of the process of getting better and learning to cope."
Are you referring to benzodiazepines or antidepressants?
"Not any different from my dad who takes high blood pressure pill before breakfast, or me putting on my ointment to manage my eczema.It's just another condition that need to be managed so you can do what you wanna do."
"Hugs. Loving yourself is enabling and empowering yourself to do what your heart desires. Give the prescription a try. If it achieves its objectives, then treat it as a routine that unlocks a better version of yourself. If the issues that pop up are disconcerting, then it will be within your power to discontinue.Be brave, bidoof"
Why are you so hard on yourself? It's OK to rely on medication for help. Especially if it makes your life easier. Life is hard enough as it is.Unless you're afraid of side effects or something.
"Do you think people who take medicine daily for illnesses like diabetes or high blood pressure are cheating?Psyche meds are no different. You are just ill, that's all."
"As a super shy, introverted and quiet person with almost no social life, I always wish that I have someone to spend vday with. Online dating is not my thing because I'm always occupied with work and I'm generally terrible with conversations anyway. Still kind of recovering from a heartbreak too. This is cringe af to say but I just want to love someone again and be loved properly in return."
"Well, same here bah. Except for the heartbreak part. But know that you’re not alone in this, so hahas, cheer up, ya?There’s nothing cringey about wanting to love someone and be loved in return. It’s what drives us forward to learn how to love another person better.Maybe you just haven’t found the right one yet, so hold yourself up high, and focus on improving yourself for that one person who is to come your way bah."
"Also someone with almost no social life, let's be friends!"
"There is nothing ""cringey"" about wanting love, perfectly normal feeling.I know what you mean and how you feel. Keep trying, there will be someone out there. Nurture your broken heart, and focus on yourself at the moment."
Sorry but why would it be cringy to say you just want to love someone again?
You've mentioned perfectly whats on my mind most of the time
"“The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.”From Moulin RougeKeep your head up, there’s someone out there looking for exactly you."
"Always keep trying. You can fail 99 times, but all it takes is one success. People like to stereotype meeting people online (in forums etc.) as taboo, but honestly its the best way for people like us with little social life. We meet hundreds of people everyday online after all."
"I think trying to keep a conversation flowing is one of the biggest headaches...No shame in wanting to loved, most just use Valentine's as an easier excuse to execute their plans."
"Same here, right in the feels."
"For valentine's Day, my boyfriend got me a gift which I really didn't like. On one hand I wished he has put in effort to research on what I like etc while on the other hand I felt so bad that I didn't like his gift and was very guilty over it.If you were me would you be honest to your partner if you received a gift you didn't like? :("
The best and lasting relationships are always built with communication as one of the key pillars.Instead of asking reddit. Talk To your bf about it.If you can't even talk to him about something as simple as this...
I’d be tactfully honest. Or he’s just going to waste his $ the next celebration.
"I would accept it (coz it took effort to think of what to get) and then tell em next time that you actually don't really like it when u mention valentines. At least he tot of you.If he asked like why didnt u tell me on that day, u can reply with 'cause ur action matters'"
"Is it your first Valentine’s day together? I would let him know after some time not immediately unless the present can be changed and he is the kind that doesn’t mind. I wouldn’t feel guilty if I were you. It rarely happens to me though, before events like birthdays, anniversaries, Valentine’s etc. I would casually mention what I want, what I don’t want, or if I even want anything at all, to avoid situations like that"
"A gift would remain meaningless on the surface, only the meaning would make you appreciate it"
Then no need gift already what. Mind matters.
luckily i'm a bbfa so i can choose my own presents /s
"No... I was honest with my ex when I didn’t like the gift he got me previously and he got really affected and unappreciated haha. But then again, maybe your bf wouldn’t take it so hard."
I wish i had partner so i could answer your qn :((((
"You don't need a partner to be more sensitive to human minds and emotions, my friend."
"Being honest is one thing being tactful about it is another. Accept the gift. Put it in your room as deco for a while. Inform him about it after a lot of time has passed (months?).""Actually, I didn't like the gift you got me this 9 months ago. Perhaps you could find out more on what I like for next year's? ""Not just the gift matters, the thought counts too. But to be so blunt soon after receiving doesn't reflect well on you but idk how close are you and your partner."
that's what death beds are for

"I had a Chinese tutor when I was 12-13 years old, who also tutored 2-3 other families who knew mine. Not a bad teacher overall, but she had one glaring flaw. She blabbed. A lot. Nothing was safe with her. My mom didn’t realise this until gossip began to circulate amongst our acquaintances. This tutor also taught my younger brother and sister (they were pretty unmotivated when it came to Chinese) and she apparently gossiped big time to the mothers of the students she liked better. As a result one of the students began to taunt my little sister because of the things he’d heard. That was what finally made my mom switch tutors. As if that wasn’t enough, this tutor had a pet whom she would constantly use as a yardstick against all her other students (not just me and my siblings). Soon we all knew her by her catch phrases “xxx did this better than you” or “xxx did this better than that student”. Remembering this tutor made me realise that some stuff that teachers pull really isn’t acceptable at all. I mean, nothing wrong with having a favourite pupil, but it sure gets old fast when you keep bringing up that one kid during lessons. Being annoyed with unmotivated students is normal and justified, but that doesn’t mean you as the adult should gossip to other parents indiscreetly about another child’s academic progress (indirectly leading other kids to bully said child).In short, those who stir the shitpot should have to lick the spoon"
Your mum was right to switch tutors
"Yeah, only it’s ridiculous that it took her so long to do it"

"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ofo-lta-suspends-operating-licence-february-14-bike-sharing-11242812Thought: would it work if LTA, instead of removing the bicycles, instead chose to remove the locks on these existing bicycles and make it free for all - thus contributing towards the goal of a car lite (and easily connected) singapore? It would also help to reduce waste due to the disposal of already built and perfectly usable bicycles."
"Use your initiative. Unlock the bikes yourself and repaint them pink if you want, and keep them indefinitely. It's not stealing if it doesn't belong to anyone."
Indeed. I've seen people doing this and I don't think anyone really cares.
Lta is only involved in granting licence/permit. If I'm not wrong it's $30/bike + $30 deposit. Properties still belong to ofo. Unable to do that.
we don’t deserve good things. someone’s going to screw these good things up. So don’t bother.
Then how would LTA earn money with all the free bikes?
"Friend was approached by a angmoh at HV and he gave her this name card (https://imgur.com/a/f17EVfA) asking her if she's interested in being a model. After some (alot of) research, we speculate it to be some escort hiring tactic.Googling the company registration number shows that it's primarily registered as a tuition centre, but secondary business is ""matchmaking"". Company registration address is a unit in a HDB block at Jelapang Rd.Its website has random women that it claims have acted in various Mediacorp shows. Only first names, no full names given.The tuition centre's website (https://www.besthometuitions.com/) is shady af, and its FB page isn't even theirs, it's a tuition centre in India.Conclusion: there are creepy people everywhere and don't fall for these traps. Always research everything before falling for these traps."
Never trust people who approach you randomly on the streets promising you some insane opportunities lol

Why bother when SAF is the de facto training ground for the CEO position in Govt linked companies anyway
Don't need global search. Just do a SAF search.
"""Look at it this way, a large pool of scholars are from Mindef. Some of them will join private businesses, and if they like it, they stay.""Good to know that we get judged by our accomplishments 20 years ago and not for our current ability."
generals are good enough anyway (as if)
Might as well embark on a universal search or even a multiversal search
They can make it into a version of “The Apprentice”. Get different CEOs to host an episode then give the position to the last person standing.
"Yet another fast food restaurant trying something out of their comfort zone, hoping to earn some fast cash, but is it worth the price at $8.95 for the meal?Surprisingly, it's actually quite fine.The meat is huge in my case, almost 1.5x the size of a normal mcspicy patty. Good ol' Zinger meat that can't go wrongMac and cheese patties for the bun was a miss. Salty and has a tiny weird aftertaste imo1 dried piece of bacon broken into half to act like there's something in the ""burger"". Actually destroyed the harmony the burger had. Everything was juicy then comes along a little dead bacon. Akin to biting into a piece of dried leaf.Verdict: 6/10, worth a try. The burger is super big, definitely eaten deconstructed. Double down was better but we can't have everything ¯\(ツ)/¯"
oof thanks for the verdict. was quite keen to try it but imma broke so my wallet thanks your review!!
imma brokei’m going to broke ?
"the cheese tasted like it came from pizza hut.Was expecting something like the kraft mac and cheese, recieved something akin to a cheese filled croquette with meat."
both sound delish
"Thanks for heads up. Like this, I go munch off the bacon first before eating the burger"
The bun to me tasted disgusting.Never gonna buy it again.
"1 dried piece of baconWell, it's turkey bacon, so no surprises there."

the blacks tho :/ nice photo nevertheless
That looks absolutely beautiful.

"I’m curious to know how long the process took (from going to A&E to the surgery table and recovery period), and how much it cost etc."
"went to polyclinic the day after my 'A's on a Saturday morning around 7am, saw the doctor at about 8, did a blood test and everything by about 1030am. doc wrote a referral letter.Then, I took a taxi to CGH A&E and reached about 11. After pre-registration and everything, was about 1130 when I had my bp and stuff taken, was taken away from my parents and asked if I smoked or took drugs. About 30 mins before seeing a doc (overheard that he's a new guy), and then sent for a few tests inside A&E. Was sent for one test to the other, with quite a fair bit of waiting time in between. About 1500, my parents were told to go and register for hospitalisation procedures. All my tests finished around 1530-1600. Was told that the appendix was swollen in a weird way, no idea what it meant.Inquired about costs at any opportunity I could, and asked for a non-invasive option if it wasn't urgent. Was told that removal wasn't exactly necessary but recommended. Chose the one that left a scar cuz it was much cheaper, and more reliable at that point in time. Kept asking to be put in the cheapest ward, no idea if it affected anything. Changed to the patient gown before being shipped to a wing, was told that the operation will probs happen the next day. was told it was after visiting hours and my parents cannot stay.was pushed to a lift and had a few detours before reaching my bed. thought it was cool they had a tv longue and everything. shared a room with like 6 people. had a nice nurse, had a chat with him and realised he's from the Philippines, with a masters in teaching. pretty cool guy, probably severely underpaid. he enjoyed the work there and was telling me how he wants to make enough money to go back and build a school back home. pretty inspiring. guy beside me was terminally ill, was told by another guy in front of me that no one visits him and i should talk to him more if i could. laid in my bed for awhile, got up (after a long while because of the pain) to go to the toilet. parents came in around 5-6pm, stayed for awhile, showed concern and was then told to leave since it was after visiting hours. had a good dinner (porridge and peanuts and stuff) and went to sleep cuz it was a tiring day.got woken up suddenly, told that there was an opening for an operation, and i could go in for one at around 11-12am. my parents rushed in and told me about it. i was kinda prepared for all sorts of complications, even if I were to die, so nothing really fazed me.pushed to a surgery room, tbh it felt more like those places where you kept dead bodies rather than operation. had a small wait in a rotunda before being pushed in. asked and was asked a few questions, heard some remarks about my bushy area from the nurse, and then anesthesia was injected. told to count down from 10, lost consciousness around 7 or 6. felt like i was kinda awake but not exactly throughout the operation. the next time i regain consciousness, I heard the doctor saying some stuff and just observed for awhile. waited for about 5 minutes before opening my eyes and about 5 more before I started moving. nurse came by soon after, and i asked if i was being pushed back to the same room. yes, apparently. It must have been 3-5 am around then, didn't keep track of time but it was still early in the morning.first thing i noticed when i woke up after sleeping after the op was that my bushy area got shaved, and then the op. scar. it felt very weird and tingly without all the hair down there and it affected me more than the scar itself honestly. but nothing major happened. had an allergic reaction to some of the drugs I was given. insisted I go home since each day probably costs quite a bit. had a chat with the nurse, with people around me, explored the hospital abit, although I should have stayed in bed. told the doc i was fine when they were doing rounds and told him i want to go home. was told to stay for a few days. insisted I was okay and wanted to, but was persuaded to stay for one more day. I didn't want any more tests, and after much insistence, the doc deemed me ready to check out on monday. said i shouldn't walked around too much, and to rest for at least a week. had an appointment to remove the stitches from the scars, and some medication.although i was told to rest in bed for about 1 week and everything, i went back to school on wednesday by public transport. some post-A's celebration or something. I was walking slowly but it was okay. went in at wee hours and took relatively flat roads to school and went home in the afternoon where there were relatively few ppl. just need to take care not to open the stitches. told only a few people about it and not much people cared that i was limping from one place to the other. bathing was abit difficult but everything was kinda normal 2-3 weeks after. closes up nicely and left a nice scar when stitches were removed. barely visible now.after insurance and everything, it costs about 60 dollars. before I think it was about 300? that's excluding the polyclinic arhh...long wall of text cuz I procrastinating now ahh"
"You left in a lot of details that I think OP wasn't interested in, but damn was that a fun read.Anyway, considering all the tests and the surgery itself I'm surprised it cost $300 before insurance."
"referral from polyclinic i think got huge discounts ahhh. and then singaporean got government subsidy mah. maybe i keep asking about the bill, the nurse also kind-hearted, help me reduce here and there. it's a two night stay and i think appendectomy quite routine also so not that ex.maybe i also remember the number wrongly, cuz i only saw the bill like wayyyy afterwards after flipping through my parents expenses lorh."
"I was touched by your bravery but at the same time saddened a little about your constant asking for cheaper alternatives.Assuming that this happened a long time ago (since your A level days), you doing better now financially?"
"actually not that long ago lah, about 5 years i think. now still in uni having fun. 3rd year undergrad arh, trying to figure out what the hell this Levi-Civita connection is to do my bloody homework. no idea what to do when i graduate, hopefully can get stable income lo. but then just taking one step at a time, having no goals and stuff liddat, cfm die when i graduate de. i think i will survive arh, just give me 3 meals a day, a floor to sleep on, i happy liao.i think i was never in a bad state financially, but bcuz of certain family situations back when i was young, comparatively I was kinda homeless for a period of time, and then had to live with very little money lo. usually skip lunch and stuff like that. but then dunno why i want to study suddenly, and then can go jc, go uni. but socially and everything else all pretty dumbo lah. see everyone else so smart, i just silent silent stay in one corner do my own shit lorh."
"They remarked about your bush right in front of you?You have insurance, why worry so much about the cost?"
"If you read the narrative given by “alternative” news sites, you will freak out by the costs too. But the truth is that, the costs of common illnesses are pretty Low. I am still supportive of Single payer but it is what it is."
"of course not in front of me lah, they where got so insensitive de. my ears abit sharp ahh, heard them talk about it among themselves at a distance away from me.i young and dumb back then mah. now not so young but still dumb. still trying to learn about alot of things ahh. i think i still very rigid in many places ahh, and cant talk in front of ppl also, so just keyboard warrior here only."
"So what happened to pinoy nurse schoolbuilder dude, your story not enough detail"
"life is liddat la, where got time know the backstory of everyone de. didnt even get his phone number cuz back then i also dont have phone. my head canon is that he got enough money to build school ahh,but then from then on got a very good impression of them lo, my buddy in army also pinoy, now also training to be nurse, but then v greedy arh. only goal in life is to get wife and make money, but he still very hilarious so i still like him.if i want add abit, maybe i will say some stuff about how the pain hor, actually occurred like 1 week+before le but bcuz i'm like, if nothing must finish A's arhh. just tahan lo. everyday lying down on bed thinking about the exam and then how to do well stuff liddat. my parents actually told me see doctor ald, but i say is normal stomachache, so just tahan and tahan. walk also abit weird but just tahan only. last day of paper i just let everything go, and then reluctantly go to polyclinic afterwards with my parents cuz they seem worried.idk what will happen if my appendix burst. maybe i will die, maybe i will live with alot of complications. who knows arhh."
"I think I’m due for a appendix removal, wanted to see how quickly I could get it removed without alarming my parents. It seems that normal procedures can take place in a day? I want to reduce my hospital stay too because I don’t think I can afford to stay in a hospital for too long..."
"are you like under 18? cuz if under 18 maybe need parents consent, not sure about the law here ah. but then even if you dont want alarm your parents, i think they will still ask for your emergency contact when you enter de, so have like a trusted friend on standby or something. make sure (s)he can contact your parents ahh.please see a doctor about this asap ahh. appendix burst is no joke. serious. you will spend way more if your appendix burst. the things the doc need to do to prevent infection and other stuff is like alot alot more.hospital stay really dependent on doctor de. nowadays got hosptial bed shortage, and the flow for op room also q hectic. ED/ED-SDA should be able to handle appendectomy within a day or 2 if its not like super urgent, so maybe you need to add 1 day to wait for op, and then maybe one more day for recovery, but there's no guarantee the doc will release you if he thinks you need to stay longer.you have the option to leave against the doctor's advice, but you have to sign quite a few release forms and everything. don't do this unless you know what you are doing ahh. cuz it will cost you more to come back and handle complications de. i not doctor, but if you do that, the doc there cfm tell you all the possible complications. not sure if he will exaggerate but he will tell you stuff. so take everything in critically ahh. best if the doc discharge you, then got anything you also will have recourse de."
"Removed my appendix at Ng Teng Fong Hospital, went to A&E about 6pm on a Friday and operation took place before noon the next day. If your condition is more severe I’m sure they’ll operate sooner, compared to my condition which was still not too badRecovery took about 2-3 days to walk properly but about 1-2 weeks to be 100% again(Unsure about costs cause I did it as NSF)"
"Just curious, were you in-camp when it happened? Or already booked out?"
Was sent to A&E by in camp MO after reporting sick
Did they IV you first? 😂
"Is that a meme? Generally IVs are done more for heat exhaustion cases, or suspected HE cases.Or you're in sispec and your encik wants to give your medic more practice, on whoever even remotely looks like he has HE"
Not sure about it now but they used to do it for fevers and the runs.
"Here's a scary one for you.Couple years back, had appendicitis MID FLIGHT while i was travelling with my family to India. It got pretty bad but i had to tahan until after landing.Went to a local clinic after touching down, was given some medicine to take but I immediately threw up. I was immediately rushed to A&E (in a really good hospital though) and had my surgery to remove it the next day.Till today that remains as the scariest moment in my life. Luckily for myself, my mum actually got all of us insurance and I was well covered for the surgery and other misc. costs.As for the actual surgery; was rolled in, given anesthesia told to count back from 10 blablabla next thing I know im being rolled back out to my ward.Honestly it almost ruined the rest of my 3 week long trip, as the first 10 days or so i was stuck in the hospital for the surgery and also recovery. Rest of the trip also still was quite painful while walking, after the trip I came back and got the staples for the incision points removed from a polyclinic.This is a great reminder for everyone to get insurance when travelling because you never know when shit might go down for real!"
"Went to a local clinic after touching down, was given some medicine to take but I immediately threw up. I was immediately rushed to A&E (in a really good hospital though) and had my surgery to remove it the next day.damn, wouldn't you go straight to A&E right after touching down?"
"Didn't think it was Appendicitis at first. After I went to the clinic then it was confirmed after i threw up. Going to the clinic actually saved me more time because the doctor called the hospital immediately and I did not have to wait at A&E, was immediately warded!"
"yikes, what a horrible experience!!!"
"I'm never sure how to know when you ""get appendicitis"". When I had it I'd spent the day at the beach and had a few beers in the evening, went to bed as normal. I woke about 2am feeling like someone had stabbed me, couldn't tolerate it, took some painkillers etc and just tried to suck it up. Went to work that day and felt progressively worse as the day went on, before eventually excusing myself to go find a Dr. The appendix was out that evening.Another mate of mine had a similar experience - but earlier in the evening he felt the stabbing pain - then went to A&E where they said his had already burst and performed the op.I can imagine it being petrifying to get that kind of pain when mid-air, but I'm not sure the initial burst of pain is necessarily tightly tied to when it's a proper medical emergency. Then again I'm no doctor, and maybe I just got lucky."
"Wow, I just had my appendix surgery done recently on the 26th of jan.Went to a&e on the night of the 25th after a day of lower abdominal pains(thought it was food poisoning). Got admitted after 5 hours of checks and appointments and waited 12 hours for surgery.Turns out my appendix had ruptured and was leaking pus into my body. Woke up from surgery with a tube inserted into my body to drain out the pus. Spent 6 days in CGH before being discharged with 2 weeks mc from date of discharge. I lost 8kg over a short period of 3 days, worst pain I have ever experienced in my life. I look at the mirror and all my bulk was gone. Doc said my recovery will be prolonged due to the complication of my case. Im still having abit of pains today.Dont even know what caused it, had my dinner and went to bed early and it happened. Overall, a very traumatic experience. Incredibly grateful for my agent who pushed me to get a rider plus just a few months before which allowed my stay in class A ward to be covered.(He didnt earn a dime on that rider as it was not his company's product but felt it was the best option for me in the market, Ive been working for just about a year).Yet to recieve the official bill, but its around 10kish of which ill not need to fork out a single cent.Main take away: Shit can happen to anyone, make sure you are covered."
"If CGH didn’t make you wait for almost a day, your appendix might not have ruptured. That in itself carried greater risks. Glad you are ok!"
"Yeah, in fact it apparently ruptured during the waiting period for surgery. They dont consider appendix to be very serious as well, so some dude who got into an accident would just be put in front of my queue for surgery.I heard from a doctor relative of mine that if I was female these kind of complications could lead to infertility as well."
"If your insurance covers private costs, and the long public queue is risky, get to a private A&E (for all the folks who still have their appendix). The long wait at public hospitals is too dangerous for some. And the MOH is not fixing it."
This is an odd question considering how appendicectomies are usually surgical emergencies with little time for considering costs and location.You or a family member encountered issues with care?
I suspect I’m due for a removal (sharp pangs within localised area) so I want to see how quickly I can get everything done without alarming my parents.
Go see a doctor instead of speculating. :)
"Go see a doctor, last thing you want is for it to rupture, further complicating your condition"
Didn't miss a thing
I waited for over 15 hours at the hospital. I spent zero and actually earned sgd 1000+ from my insurance. I got the money reward for staying at government hospital instead of fancy private hospital.
"I just got my debit card and wanted to get stardew valley but my account is US based and requires a 5 digit zip, how do i get around this?"
Try 97330 this zip code doesn’t have tax
"aite cool, just confirming, this is not illegal is it?"
totally not especially when Nintendo doesn’t even have eShop in Singapore 🤦‍♂️
"ah cool alright, just checking, thank you!!!"
Hah good old Oregon
"https://eshop-prices.com/prices?currency=SGDUse this to see which country has the best prices first. For stardew valley for example, Mexico has the price always at lower price cuz of economic pricing reasons. Just keep switching regions and buy there. Switch games are region free. We can do that cuz we don’t have an eShop in SG. You can switch to japan also to get some exclusive games there too.For more help, you can check our the switch sg group on fb. I can’t link it here but just search Switch Singapore on fb.Edit: hope you really haven’t bought the game on the US shop, if not butt hurt wasted $5. https://eshop-prices.com/games/368-stardew-valley?currency=SGD"
"ah damn i alr bought it, i'll take note for next time tho, thank you!"
"Yes, this is what I uses too to compare the price. I have 3 profiles, Japan, US and Mexico and I will change the US one often to other cheaper options when there's a need. The price difference can sometime be around $30! With exclusive store offers, it can go even higher sometimes."
"i use a canada eshop account to get my games. from what i've heard, the tax is cheaper there but i can't confirm because i'm too lazy to check."
U could always log into your Nintendo account online and change the account to Canada to take advantage of the exchange rate. It’s slightly cheaper than US. I use PayPal to purchase the digital game.
Buy eshop credits on platforms such as Shopee. Use promo codes for discounts. With normal promo code can usually offset 10 dollars off a 50USD credit. Maximum I got before was 100USD for 70SGD
What promo code did you use and how much discount did you get?
"The promo code that is consistently there is the ones you redeem with Shopee coins. If you have 250 Shopee coins I used the 10 dollar off 50 for mobile and computer category. If not you have to wait for seasonal sale promo codes. Eg. During CNY. However, do note that the free promo codes they release have been decreasing in value over the months."
"just set your Nintendo a/c to US, then add Paypal as payment methodyou can set your system's region to UK or Aus/NZ if you prefer 24H time and temp in °C"
is it cheaper to buy games digitally on switch rather than physical ?
"should be same price, depending on region, could be cheaper or more ex.some games are only available digitally, like the smaller games, the ones not big enough to be made into physical forms"
I like to use https://savecoins.app to compare prices. Better interface imo

No...It's just improved PR in the age of social media where mindef cannot be fully dependent on mainstream media to protect them and deflect public attention or anger.
"As someone has mentioned before, the Betteridge's law of headlines states that any headline that ends with a question mark can be answered by the word ""No""."
"I dunno man, i mean it has alr changed quite abit. Alot of procedures put in place and blah blah blah. SOP more than badminton."
when sop too many. it's humanly impossible to follow. not practical.
Issit tho? Or issit cause people lazy to follow?
"true true but if that is the case even if he is a changed man to implement more sop, cultural problems won't go away."
"Cultural problems cant be solved overnight. Too much to be discussing it on v-day. Problem can solved when people put one another’s life into consideration i.e warrants and officers looking out for their man. And the man playing their part, looking out for your peers. Parents also need to teach their kids not to just siam dodge geng when they can, but also do their best, if body cannot then just tap out. And public shouldnt be quick to judge when our nsfs take a sit on the train/bus. Well list can go on. But i think everyone kinda knows."
hahahaha what to do I am one of the sad ones that doesn't have a valentine.yea it's a mixture of issues I certainly agree. but ultimately cultural problems are very difficult to change. my personal opinion (and probably most will disagree) is to attempt to employ a private sector method of bringing in someone from the outside to helm the ministry. which in our case would be quite hard since it automatically excludes half the population. not saying this is the best idea. but just observing it has never been done here.
"Yea i feel ya. I also one of them but discussing this on v-day even sadder. Can hug sar-21 and cry. Lol.It may work and it may not. One reason as to why it may not work is they are not know the inner workings of the ministry. Heck, my rank too low and my job designation too low to know how to run an organisation. Private sector leaders tend to be more profit minded. Or in some cases, not empathetic to their employees. too many aspects to factor in. But hey who knows maybe one day they might. (Japan had brought in a monk to lead an airline before, so not say it might not happen, maybe we need a monk to lead also 😂)"
you just made my day but I hope we get a monk soon 😂
Glad i did bud 😂 time to cry ourselves to sleep
"I usually sit in the front because I think it feels more respectful (??) to the driver, and less awkward if we somehow make conversation. However my boyfriend told me that sitting in the front may not be the safest so I should sit at the back...I had an experience with a hitch driver telling me that I should sit at the front yadayada and afterwards I just made it a point to sit in the front no matter if I get a justgrab or a hitch.Just wanted to find out what other Singaporeans thoughts are!"
"Front for a hitch, back for a normal Grab/GoJek/etc."
Front if I am alone. Back if I have a lot of bags or am with my wife.
"I sit in the back if I'm alone. Feels safer, especially after incidents of molest cases happening."
^ :)
"isn’t it like taking a taxi? sitting at the back is what i do, i treat it like a taxi.I’m surprised people sit in front thou"
"Ya, for Grab rides, up to you, since it's their job.For Hitch rides however, app advises sitting in front and yeah since they aren't professional drivers, I guess I'll sit in front."
"Cool, thanks for the explaination"
"curious, r hitch drivers classified as private hire drivers? do they need to go to the training and get license?"
"Don't think so, at least according to Grab.All I know is that they're just people mostly going to and from their work, since Hitch drivers can only do 2 trips per day."
Hitch don’t need PHV.
"Do most people sit in front? I sit behind, way too awkward if the driver isn't the chatty type. Would be nice if the app had an indicator for the driver to specify which they prefer."
"Since i am a male,i usually sit in front.it doesn't matter if the driver is opposite gender.As long as you remain respectful to your driver & vice versa,i am fine with it.It easier to have a chat with your driver."
"Fuck care. Sit at the back la, they not doing it for free... there are more important things in life to be care about, for both rider and driver.."
"For hitch I will sit in front, justgrab will sit behind"
"Sit at the back since I’m paying for their service. However, if my friend or parents are the one giving me a lift, I will sit in front"
"When I was a wee lad, my neighbour who was my family dentist gave me a lift to his clinic because I was his first patient of the day. So, when it was time he swung by my place, I jumped into the back seat. He turned around and said, eh, come sit front seat. Was quite stunned cos usually my parents would sit in front and us kids sat at the back. So I did. Later that day told my father this story then kena sound by him... Eh think Uncle X your chauffeur ah? Haha!"
"Yup, mine was when my father first fetched me to school, I sat the back seat and he said it’s basic courtesy to sit in front if someone is giving you a lift. But for taxi/grab I will definitely sit at the back."
"Sit a the back, Sitting in the front is really awkward, especially when you're the only one in the car"
"I'm one of the few who prefers the front. I don't know, I prefer the view out the windscreen."
I prefer to sit in front coz I like to view out the windshield and pretend that I'm the one driving.It feels awkward to me to have so much space beside me when I'm alone in the car coz I'm tempted to just lay down and nap 😂
I strangely sit at the front. A driver asked me once about it but I figured I tend to get conversations when I sit in front so I figured since theyve been driving all day Ill just do that and it makes their day a little better talking to someone. plus its totally a better view.
"random side story:i had a girlfriend who went on a date with this guy. at the end of the date, they called a grab - naturally she went to sit at the back, but the guy actually went to sit in the front. even the driver tio shocked, ""eh bro uh sit at the back lah"", the guy was like oh no no it's ok. the whole journey got pretty awkward after that + it wasn't like they could really make conversation lol.edit: ok afterwards the girl asked the guy why he sat in front, to which he replied ""huh it's only polite to the driver what"" zzz"
tldr: girlfriend complained to me about her ex
"For hitch, I'll msg the driver to ask if I should sit in front or at the back. It's their car, and I'm getting a discount on the fare so I don't mind asking.I don't take hitch often, only the few times I need to take long distance rides from one end of the island to another. Usually the hitch drivers will ask me to sit in the back. A couple of times they have their own regulars who will sit in front and they're used to chatting with.For normal Grab/GoJek/taxis, I'll just sit in the back. I think the drivers are also more used to this. I realise that some cars even have the front passenger seat pushed all the way to the front so there's more space at the back. Also means they're not used to having a passenger in front."
Always at the back for normal grab cos I don’t really want to strike up a conversation?Ended work at 3am one day and the driver kept trying to explain to me his theory that aliens exist and sci fi was created because there was no other way to share this information zzz would have been worse if I sat in front I guess
"If it's someone I know, and no one else is sitting or is expected to sit at the front, I sit at the front out of respect. Because that signals that I are socially open to the driver. That is polite because the driver is doing me a favour by giving me a ride; and doing so because of a desire to build or honour friendship/kinship. By accepting the ride offer, I have acknowledged that desire and imply that I bear a similar desire. I could have rejected it otherwise.For taxi rides (or equivalents), I sit at the back, for the very same reasons. Because that signals that I am not socially open to the driver. I am paying for a ride, the driver is there to provide the service, and I am in no way obliged to engage in anything beyond superficial social contact with the driver.Of course, I could choose to sit in the front if I wanted to be socially open; but I then would have to commit to being in a socially open position for the entire trip, even if I later realise that I do not enjoy the society of the driver."
"Back, behind the driver. The center seat is statistically the safest seat in a saloon car with seat belt on, but it’s awkward to be there alone so behind the driver is the next logical move. This way, the stranger driving the vehicle can’t have eye contact with you nor effectively speak with you either."
I like to sit in the front because I want wider view to see outside and also aircon is directly in front of you. Seating in the back makes me nausea.
"Ladies should sit at the back regardless of hitch or normal grab/gojek/taxi IMO.yeah sure you want to be nice and not all drivers are sexually deprived perverts. It is still safer for the lady.For men the likelihood of being in ""that situation"" is less but i won't ruled it out. Okay to sit in front if you are in a chatty mood."
front if I don't mind having a chit chat with the driverback if i'm going to be on my phone and listen to my music
"I usually sit in the front, but I'm a dude so there's less issues about being molested. If I'm with my girlfriend on a JustGrab or GrabShare I'd sit in the back with her."
in my experience taxi and grab drivers. or drivers of hired vehicles in general prefer you to seat in the back.often they don't expect to have a full car and use the front seat as a sort of storage space. if you sit in front you actually cause them the trouble of clearing up the seat for you.that being said some people feel sitting behind is rude.
"Always the front if I am alone, and the back if I am with someone else or when I am really tired. It makes conversation flows easier."
i sit in the back if its not shared like justgrab or gojeckif it’s shared like hitch or grabshare prefer to sit in front so wont have to move about in the back to allow others to get on or off
"I always sit behind. I prefer to get to my destination without talking at all, apart from saying hi when I board the car. I cringe inside when the driver is chatty but I have no choice so I still reply politely."
"I sit in the front. I have motion sickness, and I usually travel alone on Grabshare. Heard that sitting upfront is better for motion sickness than at the back."
front for hitch (though I've had hitch drivers telling me to sit behind) and back for just grab. used to sit in front for normal grab too bc it felt weird but got used to sitting behind now.
Back.For safety and comfort.
Hitch? In front.Shared Ride? In front.Anything else? At the back.
"Just sit wherever you like man , I usually seat at the back cause there’s more space."
"I student so i always got bag, sit at the bag can put bag at the back seat"
Been taking hitch alot at night and i no choice have to sit at the back cause the driver bring wife along hahahah. Happen to me quite a few times alr
"It's down to your own preference, no one should dictate. Think it's weird(rude?) for someone to force you, if there are empty seats front/back.Personally I like to sit in front to converse. It's interesting listening to their life stories. Joy, success, anguish, bitterness, regret, hope, are but just some of the themes I've encountered. One day I shall perhaps, compile a book ..."
"Front. Safer, theres a front airbag."
I prefer sitting in the back for the most part because I don’t want to invade the driver’s space sitting in front. I do naturally go shotgun if it’s a friend’s car.
Back. I just prefer the distance
"Used to sit in the front when I came to SG because I was used to it. I liked the view, the back made me carsick, and I thought it made the trip feel less like a business transaction - thought drivers would appreciate being able to talk and break the monotony a bit.But a lot of drivers here gave me the impression that they felt it was weird/awkward and wanted their own space to work in silence. So now I'm a back-sitter as well."
"If you prefer to sit at the back, ask the driver first before you get in the car. Most drivers don’t mind if you do that!However my friend did encounter a grabhitch driver who said “no. Sit in front” 😅"
tbh you're supposed to sit in front on Hitch. App even tells you so.But for regular Grab rides I'd prefer the back.
"I don’t think there’s any “supposed to” because it’s not a regulation. Grab recommends that you do that, but if the passenger prefers to sit at the back (e.g.because of safety purposes), I think it’s ok.I’ve also had grabhitch drivers who told me they prefer their riders to sit in the back. Perhaps it’s just the older generations of grabhitch drivers who don’t like this? I heard that it’s because they don’t think of themselves as “chauffeurs” and find it rude when people sit in the back."

"SINGAPORE - A paedophile, who sexually violated the eight-year-old son of a friend despite the valiant efforts of another boy to protect the victim, pleaded guilty in the High Court on Wednesday (Feb 13) .The prosecution is seeking at least 12 years' preventive detention for Sanusi Ahmad, 57, a recalcitrant offender who has spent a large part of his life behind bars since he was 26.The current offences were committed less than a year after he was released from jail for molesting and threatening a 29-year-old woman with a knife in 2013 after she rejected his sexual advances.The boy and his mother, a single parent who depended on social welfare, lived at a rental flat with another woman and her son, who was the same age as the victim.Sanusi was a friend of the boy's mother and would occasionally visit the flat.One day in June 2016, he turned up at the flat unannounced, while both women were sleeping in the living room and the two boys were playing in the bedroom.The witness was absorbed in playing mobile games and did not pay attention to what Sanusi was doing in the bedroom until he heard the victim shouting ""abang, help me, help me"". Abang is Malay for older brother.When he looked up, the witness saw Sanusi performing a sexual act on the victim.Shocked, he told the man to stop his disgusting acts. But Sanusi stared at him menacingly and asked the witness to sit on the bed with him as well.The witness tried to pull the victim away but was physically blocked by the man. He watched helplessly as Sanusi performed oral sex on the victim, who was begging the man to stop.Sanusi asked the boys to touch him but they refused. He left after giving the witness $10.The sexual assault came to light after the boys' mothers became suspicious.The witness's mother wondered why her son received $10 from the man.Meanwhile, the victim's mother noticed that in the days following the incident, Sanusi kept engineering opportunities to be close to her son, even though the boy seemed averse to him.Under questioning, the victim revealed that Sanusi had touched him inappropriately.His mother confronted the man, but he denied any wrongdoing. A neighbour who heard the commotion called the police.According to a child psychiatrist's report, the victim was shy, spoke with a stutter and has learning difficulties.The accused, who is sexually attracted to boys aged 10 to 12, said he preyed on the victim as he found the boy ""cute"".He pleaded guilty to one charge of sexual penetration of a minor. Five other charges, including two for showing a pornographic video to the two boys, were taken into consideration.Deputy Public Prosecutor Yvonne Poon argued that Sanusi was a menace to society who should be taken out of circulation to protect the public. Among his criminal history, he was sentenced to seven years' preventive detention in 1996 for molesting two 10-year-old boys.The court called for a report to assess if he was suitable for preventive detention. The case will be heard again on March 13.A psychiatric report stated Sanusi has alcohol use disorder, paedophilic disorder, and gender dysphoria, a condition in which people identify with a gender different from the one they were born with.According to past media reports, Sanusi lived as a woman for six years and took female hormone pills but decided in 1991 that he wanted to be a man again."
It is time (overdue in fact) for a sex offenders registry in Singapore.
"I will support that if and only if it is implemented in a fair and logical manner. In other countries there are minors who get placed on it for life for sending suggestive pics to other minors. Usually only the male gets charged and registered, while females get away scot free.In Singapore this will happen even more since there are many acts that are only considered sexual crimes if committed by a male (eg rape)."
Agree with this. When employers see a dude on the offender's list they imagine a grown man predating on underage girls when it could have been two 15 year olds exploring their own sexuality. The registry needs proper planning.
Not sure why is there a HIV registry but no Sex Offender registry lol.
How can a registry help in this case?
"In this particular case of a recalcitrant paedophile purposefully going inside a rental flat filled with kids to target them, then yeah, a registry wouldn’t help.If I were the authorities, I would stipulate certain conditions for release, like he is forbidden to be in close proximity to a child unless supervised, or it is back to jail he goes. And if a prison psych deems a paedophile as likely to re-offend, then don’t release him into the general community."
"Leads me down along black mirror/China tech monitoring lines, if upon release, potential recalcitrant probationer are tracked on their whereabouts and online activity, for their social worker to better and safely assess their rehabilitation into society."
truly disgusting
yo wtf
Lock him up and throw away the key.

Fuck this guy with a bulldozer. As a parent just reading the article makes me furious.My condolences to the kid for what happened. I hope he turns out alright.
I live close by. They have been closing down for almost 2 years.
Is this pasir ris ? lol
Yuup.
It's not only pasir Ris Branch actually lol. i've been waiting for the closure for a long time now.
oh my lmaooo
Gotta hire people to close the place down.
"Ok we get the joke, don't need to post this on here every week..."
Closing down sale leh you not excited meh?
"Even if not excited, just visualise and smile ◡̈"
Fire sales 4ever
Singapore's top unsolved paradox
At this point even valuedollar the boss probably knows this is a joke and is using this for free advertising like this
Maybe Closing Down Sale is their shop name
Isn’t this located at Pasir Ris? I live really close by and I swear they have been ‘closing down’ for at least 5 years now.
Eh my house nearby. They have been closing down for as long as I remember haha
They meant closing down after operating hours
Never happens
Where is this place?
This particular outlet seems to be in Pasir Ris Drive 6 there
"Everywhere they are located. They stumbled upon this tactic at one of their outlets and now it's being used at other outlets. The one that neighbourhood mall next to Boon Keng MRT Station, the new outlet at Marine Parade Central etc"

lol yeah I read this and was like wtf? Kinda doubt this too.
"Farrera-Brochez first obtained the HIV registry, he said, after recovering two laptops that had been stolen out of his apartment by somebody who Farrera-Brochez believed was having an affair with Ler. Having noticed that some of his files were missing, Farrera-Brochez uploaded a program from the internet to recover them. That’s when the registry popped up, Farrera-Brochez said.So many questions...If someone ""steals"" a computer file, why would it be missing? They can just copy them right?Where do I find said program?"
"He is making the allegation that after the laptops were stolen, there has been alterations or deletions to the files.So he claims to have downloaded a data recovery software to recover / roll back data back to a certain point in time. Most data recovery software can do that.Then what he is alleging is that during the time the laptops were stolen, or perhaps before that, there was a point in time where the said registry was on the laptop and subsequently deleted. So the said data recovery software would have recovered not only the allegedly ""missing files"" but also recovered back the ""registry"" which they claimed were never copied into the laptop by him or Ler."
"Man, the article does not paint him in a good light..."
"He's always been a lying scumbag. No matter how you spin the story, it always going to end with him being a lying scumbag."
"Hell, he didn't paint a good picture of himself"
Well it corroborates with his motives given that he’s the key interviewee and information source.
*roll my god damn eyes*Do note that he has lied before soooooooooo
That’s an interesting article. Thanks for sharing
"Only the cover up is believable. Every other part reeks of bullshit. Considering he’s well-known for spinning tall tales (child prodigy nonsense that appeared in the news a while back), it’s hard to take him at his words. He should just release whatever evidence he has that exonerates him."
He probably doesn’t have anything to exonerate himself.
All the better to destroy whatever credibility he has left so we can all move on.

I thought he was playing dravidan/TPJ Bingo here...
Care to elaborate? I don't understand what you said
"dravidan is infamous reddit user around here, always posting about anti government stuff. People explain to him why he is wrong and he just ignores them and almost never replies.TPJ is the fake Oxford historian who called Mahathir to bring democracy to Singapore. His doctorate is real but his title and position at Oxford is an unproven mess.I think what the guy means is this Brochez guy is stirring shit like dravidan/TPJ."
Isn’t TPJ's appointment at Oxford legitimate? The university has already confirmed it.
"He's not really a staff at Oxford. IIRC all Oxford said was his doctorate is real. Basically they didn't employ him. I think it's some research group where academics come together to pool their knowledge. What people said is Thum is actually teaching in Singapore.Research associates are not employees of the university, said Rouse, but are “valued colleagues with whom we have shared research interests”.https://sg.news.yahoo.com/oxford-clarifies-thums-role-research-associate-school-anthropology-report-083013903.html"
"This is such bullshit. Many countries in which you intend to permanently reside require a health and criminal check and have the grounds to deny your visa based on your assessment; what would be the point of keeping the aforementioned information if not for the purpose of adding to a registry of who's in the country and who's not in the country. I imagine any country in this digital age would have a registry of information of who is in the country.He's not a whistleblower, just an attention seeking maniac."

"Edmw CSIs are debunking his ""evidence"" now. Very interesting."
Why is it that I trust EDMW CSIs more than any government response to his claims
They can discuss until everything seems to check out. A says something. B questions. C changes hypothesis. D refutes. E suggests something else. Repeat and repeat until everything seems to make sense.Tiagong last time got an angmo death case in sg. SG police closed case as suicide. EDMW stirred until FBI came in to interview them. Ended up not suicide I think.
If this is the Huawei case I think FBI came in to CORROBORATE the suicide verdict.
Any link for that for my reference?

"Isit just me cause I can't stand the way he presented his points.Like alot of unnecessary attacks (""Lee regime!"", ""Oppression on LGBT!"" ""REEEEEeeeeee"") and a defense that reeks of desperation.Though since I have yet to looked at the evidences in the attachment, I won't jump to conclusions la. Just first impressions."
"Totally like what a half delusional guy would do what lol. He had HIV and faked his blood test, then now he's saying we gave him HIV by getting him gang raped in jail. What a crazy ass story."
And the fact that he highlighted he was placed in a cell with Muslim inmates. Racist much??? People are gonna imply that they passed the HIV to him. But wasn't he in jail because he faked his blood test and had it all along?
The religion part is just not right la.
Most of his comments arent right lor
"Maybe the Singapore government is so homophobic that it gets Muslim inmates to rape gay men in jail for reasons undisclosed.Or more likely, this guy is a professional liar who's fabricated a tale that is supposed to outrage the American left and right alike."
"Should we invent a new name for it - the ""Michael Fay complex"" or the ""Bill Browder complex""? You choose, I guess."

"My friend made the same point while chatting to me about it - his post and replies sounds like a local guy. Aka *suspicious *Friend also has this conspiracy theory it could all be the work of China. At first I was dismissive but I asked him what he meant - ah, connecting the dots and lines from the various health data breaches so far and that this seems along the same line plus pretty well orchestrated. He feels China is doing all it can to bring Singapore down. Which might not be a wild conspiracy theory if you think about it."

Golden rule of the internet: take everything with a pinch of salt
There are a number of grammatical errors in that post that I would not expect an American to make
He’s just embarrassing himself tbh
"Actually I suspect he is just trying to transform himself into a victim of political persecution by an authoritarian regime so that the US courts are less inclined to extradite him back here to Singapore. If he can convince them that the charges brought against him are politically motivated, it is likely that the US government / judiciary will block any request by Singapore to return him back.That and he is also clearly a compulsive liar; shame isn't exactly his thing. Perhaps he and Amos Yee should link up in the States, seems they have so much in common"
He should just face the consequences and stop lying. He reminds of me that weird US marine guy who kept shitposting this sub about him beating up a local taxi driver.This Brochez guy is obviously delusional.
"that weird US marine guyYoungsters, gather around. It's a deeeep rabbit hole."
"Wa, I don't even know his name, you still remember lol."
It was a seal
"Can’t take him seriously if he keeps using “Lee regime” but if this turns out to be true, looks like some people are gonna resign"
looks like some people are gonna resignHahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahaahahahahaahahahahahahaahah....hahahahahahahahahahahaha
"looks like some people are gonna resignYes, just like those times when the SMRT CEO, the Chief of Defence Force, and the SingPost CEO resigned after repeated train breakdowns, training deaths, and delivery failures. Looking forward to that!"
"Ok, resign and posted to another cushy spot"
He and Alex Tan should be bffs

"Lol dude even if this is true, no one will admit to it, much less any resignation. This brochez dude is trying to instigate an uprising by the lgbtq community in order to save his own ass. Even if what he said turned out to be true, don't even think for one second that the gahmen will not just double-down, and brutally crush any sort of uprising attempt. This guy better not return to sg. If he thinks Changi prison is bad, he is really going to hate it when he gets to lim kopi long long time."
"I don't understand what's up with people and their obsession with ""if you don't come clean I will release incriminating evidence of you""-esque threats.If the party allegedly framing you is virtuous enough to release evidence of their wrongdoings and admit to their lies, they wouldn't have framed you in the first place.Likewise, if you have the evidence contrary to everything else that's presented against you, why wouldn't you release it right off the bat unless 1) you are just bullshitting 2) you are a piece of shit trying to blackmail the other party?Grow the fuck up man, life is way more than kids threatening each other to tattle to their teachers and parents."
Stupid American
"release this email if they have nothing to hideYou mean the email you sent them? You know, the one in your email account which you can access anytime and release to the public?"
He released that in his facebook post.Enough evidence to back up that MOH at least knew about this during the time of his emails.

"Came to play Buzzword Bingo, not disappointed at all.It's pretty clear that he's just trying to push all the right buttons to get as much as attention as possible, and then hopefully get the US government in on this. Problem is that his reputation and credibility is about as watertight as the Titanic after it high-fived an iceberg. Considering how many things he has lied about, taking his words at face value would be one heck of a misstep.Doesn't stop people from doing so though, unfortunately."

"""When Farrera-Brochez showed up for a blood test later that day, Ler served as his doctor. And instead of submitting a sample of Farrera-Brochez’s blood, Ler handed in his own, HIV-negative blood under his partner’s name.""It is hard to believe that Ler would remain HIV free if his partner has it."
"Not really. HIV is manageable with antiviral therapy (which Mikhy was probably on), and so far there have been zero cases reported of transmission from HIV positive individuals with an undetectable viral load. Also, as Ler knew Mikhy was HIV positive, doesn't it follow that they would practice safe sex? You think Ler as a doctor (or anyone with common sense) would willingly have unprotected sex with a person he knows has HIV and not on treatment?"
Thanks for the enlightenment!
"You think Ler as a doctor (or anyone with common sense)Looking at all the shit Ler pulled, I’m not so sure about that"
Yes it's possible. Anti viral drugs plus protection

"Never been an addict of nicotine, but I have heard friends recently speaking of vaping.When I looked deeper, it seems that Singapore banned it despite less health detriments compared to smoking.Furthermore, there have recently been some ads regarding vaping being badIs vaping a recently rising thing, or has it been a problem for a long time?And why dosen’t Singapore want to let smokers switch? Seems awfully suspicious what with the cigarette tax and all.Edit: corrected my crappy phrasing"
"Govt is worried about the vast numbers of people who have never smoked before (teens especially) picking up vaping in other countries. I believe that if they can find a way to make it prescription only (for smokers who want to quit under medical advice), they will allow it. But it’s too difficult to enforce because of all the online sellers."
"Yeah, thats what I thought too. Its good for quitters, but bad news for newcomers"
Gateway drug is an issue. The main reason is mods. These are customized addons to the unit. Many of these mods have violently exploded.
"i believe that its a mixture of its a new thing, and fear of the lack of control.Anything new is always taken with a pinch of salt, the government must take a stand early on if they will allow vaping to be legal or illegal. Theres no middle ground. If they take too long to decide, the market will be filled with vaping products and control will be hard. Similar to E-scooters. it started off as a simple motor powered 'board' now its everywhere on bikes, and scooters with heavy criticism from many pov.Since like what others have mentioned, vaping is not harmless, therefore the easiest solution is to ban first, regulate later when other countries or the Singapore gov themselves find better ways to control and Singapore to slowly integrate it into the market.Also, possible pov is that the vaping liquid is hard to control. Now people bring in cartons of cigs through custom as unpaid duty cig, if singapore were to allow vaping, thats one more item they have to look out for which can be hidden anywhere. Waterbottles....gas tank... how will they implement new measures to ensure these are not smuggled across borders?"
"Damn youre right.I honestly thought that the vaping liquid was the same as drugs, but it seems that its much easier to smuggle.But this means that there is a possibility that in the future, e cigs can be used for good means/ regulated enough that the gov deems it safe?"
"it could be thought to be of anything really.. mostly because its illegal in singapore, so no one really bothers to research about what it really is and then rumors spread... yada yada.. but its possible.. but the question really is.. when?"
"despite health benefits compared to smoking.Wrong words to use. Smoking has no health benefits, neither does vaping. The correct phrase should be ""less health detriments relative to smoking"""
Ayy ima edit this now
thanks!
Honestly couldn't care less about the benefits.Vaping is a great alternative to cigarette smoke as a non-smoker all power to vaping!
"In my experience its easier to mix your own juice for vaping compared to cigs, the only part you have get for is the physical component. Therefore its much harder to tax as compared to cigarettes. Furthermore there's no big vaping mnc to pressure the government to sell it neither unlike traditional smokes."
Best to read different sources to determine pros and conshttps://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/quit-smoking-tobacco/is-vaping-safer-than-smokinghttps://www.pcrs-uk.org/news/e-cigarettes-may-be-more-harmful-we-think-vaping-still-safer-tobacco-smokinghttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/e-cigs-and-second-hand-vaping/

"Around 12% of Singapore population are smokers. Assume on the average, a pack of Cigarette is smoked a day. (tax is around $7.50 per pack gst $ 1)5,6000,000 * 0.12 * $8.5 = $5,712,000 this is around 5~6mil tax per day.multiply by 365, around 2bil in tax a year. that's the reason."
"I don't understand this argument, we are regulated enough that a tax on e-cig's wouldn't be that difficult to achieve in the medium-term."
Why can't vaping be taxed too?
Pretty stupid considering they can tax the liquid
Then theres also the additional costs of subsidising healthcare for people who get sick as a result of smoking.The net income is almost neglible.
Average pack cost 11.90. Even the breaks are about 9 bucks.
Damm
"""Health benefits"" hum..."
"""Compared to smoking"".I don't think anyone (outside conspiracy theorists) claims that vaping is actually beneficial overall, but I also don't think anyone is saying ""smoking cigarettes is better than vaping for your health""."
"Yes, but you can't say for ""health benefits"", just explain vaping is less dangerous than smoking. Life/health is too important to avoid semantic. There is no benefits for health to smoke or vaping. Both are dangerous, one less than the other."
"There’s a huge cultural problem with vaping especially in the younger generation that’s going to far outweigh the possible benefits that e-cigs may bring in helping smokers quit. Almost every high schooler / college kid in the US would’ve come across trendy versions like the ‘juul’. Not to mention that the studies have CLEARLY shown the adverse health effects associated with vaping. This is not even considering that every once in a while someone ends up in the AnE in the US because their vape pen exploded. Never forget that the tobacco industry at one point vehemently denied any adverse effects with cigarette smoking. Smoking was even encouraged during pregnancy.There is already a heavily subsidised smoking cessation programme available for those who are serious about quitting smoking. Even if e cigs are the only way for them to quit, it can be provided in an extremely controlled manner to those who want to quit.Personally I think that anyone who believes unbanning e cigs will have more benefits than harm is just being naiive."
"Yeah looking at the JUUL crisis in America now, I bet the Singapore government is glad they took the conservative route. Many regulations to think about/put in place before they would ever think of legalising e-cigs."
Govt haven implement their tax system for vaping
XD
"despite health benefitswot u smoking, m8?unless there are e-juice sold consists of nothing but multi-vitamins.Furthermore, there have recently been some ads regarding vaping being badfor the uninformed, those ads works!And why dosen’t Singapore want to let smokers switch? Seems awfully suspicious what with the cigarette tax and all.that. and our gahment alrdy fork out monies for programs for quitting. can't just let one or another alternatives to claim the achievements"
"""Health benefits compared to smoking""But yeah I gotta agree, now that I think about it itll be pretty stupid to put all that rehab money to waste"
"https://www.todayonline.com/commentary/singapores-ban-e-cigarettes-misguidedThe Ministry of Health in Singapore has maintained that there are no long-term (25 to 30 year) scientific studies to show whether these devices materially increase or decrease diseases in the using population. Thus, caution should be taken in acting on the current evidence.One reason for Singapore’s ban is that the authorities are choosing to take a moral stand: that allowing e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn tobacco products can be seen as condoning nicotine addiction and addiction is sufficiently heinous to outweigh the benefits of reduced smoking.It's a silly reason (and definitely not the whole story) for justifying a complete ban, but considering Singapore's authoritarianism reputation, it's not really that surprising.As for anti-vaping ads, I haven't really kept a lookout for them but I'm guessing media manipulation is part of the reason.Not exactly related, but this is a pretty interesting read, comments included. I'm supportive of e-cigarettes (note: I don't smoke) if it helps people quit, but this is a good example of how it has its cons as well (eg. exacerbating the youth smoking problem in this case) so I guess the complete ban isn't all bad."
"Vaping is a “less harmful” substitute for cigarette smoking. It’s almost as bad but recent advertising and exposure make it a “better” option if you are a smoker. However, teenagers/young adults who never smoked in their life are suddenly enthralled by the cool aesthetic of vaping and are misled into believing that vaping is not harmful. Vaping is supposed to be smokers’ less harmful substitute but young hipsters nowadays pick up vaping too. Vaping can cause respiratory problem just like cigarette smoking. Same thing as shisha and smoking weed too. Long term usage will definitely damage the lungs regardless. Furthermore, people tend to vape more in public because the stigma of vaping is not as serious compared to smoking. Yet, vaping also causes secondhand smoke to others. I have asthma and people have the audacity to tell me vaping doesn’t trigger my illness because it’s “healthier”."
"I mean, there hasn't been any long term research about vaping yet, because there aren't any long term vape users.Singapore is always slow to pick it up because they're scared, wait for a few years and then it might get legalised."
"I think it should be prescription only.Early research seems to support the notion that vaping is less harmful than traditional cigarettes but there are some caveats.Traditional tobacco companies are now buying up vaping companies. See the Altira-Juul deal.Vaping liquids contain more nicotine than traditional cigarettes - i.e., the addictive component. The exact pharmacology (read: dose delivered) is still under research but it begs the question of why E-Cigs have a higher nicotine content if part of their utility is as quitting aidsUptake by youths. This is a massive problem. US states that track data show that vaping, because of its perceived ""safety"" and ""coolness"", are heavily subscribed by tobacco naive youths."
"If vaping liquids were regulated, could nicotine levels in it be regulated too?"
I don't see why not. Little incentive for vaping companies to do so though.It's literally a legal drug that is addictive. Doesn't get any better than that to ensure a strong customer base.
"I'm was a regular cigg smoker for more than 20years, I've recent moved to heat not burn ciggs. These devices cut down chain smoking as it requires u to charge the pen after 1 cig. There is no burning of the cigg just heating it up. There is near no smell of the heating tobacco process and I still. Get. My nicotine fix. It's mostly vapor. Recently someone gave me a normal pack of my old favorite luckies. But I couldn't stand the taste and smell of the burning. I also noticed that my usual blocked nose have been cleared compared to when I was smoking normal ciggs. Imho I rather they tax these heat not burn ciggs and let me just continue smoking iqos instead of outright banning it 😭"
So it clearly seems that it definitely is a better option than normal ciggs. To me second hand smoke from ecigs are much cleaner too.Hopefully the govt can sorta get a good grip on what to do soon
I’m fairly certain that’s not a tornado.
"Yea it was a waterspout, realised my mistake. Thanks"

Anyone remember if there was a waterspout at Johor Straits around 2001?
I saw one at Tuas back in 2013 on my first day in unit. I saw a spiral in the sky which then bent over and just kept extending downwards.
"I remember that well, we were on the beach down at the east coast at the time."
"Uh you need to add some context. Otherwise it could be ""Mindchamps teachers arrested for sexual abuse."""
Lmao
“Police display auto lock feature”
"""ma'am stop ma'am"""
Was wondering the same thing
“Kids getting arrested because they are Chinese”
This is fucking hilarious
"Those are Community Engagement Police Officers. Specialised in well, community engagement."
"Mata wear shorts, my Ah Ma says. Now I understooded."
couldn't have said it better myself
"You better behave in class ah, else I call police catch you."
"Its a good thing, community engagement from young builds trust. I say well done la men in blue"
The one in white is a community policing officer. Community engagement is a very important aspect in policing.

Apparently they’re offering $20 for unlimited data? https://mustsharenews.com/circles-life-20gb/
https://i.imgur.com/n48aUGX.pngcheckout the image filename:/wp-content/uploads/20unlimitedprank-plandiscontinue-1.pngwaddya think?
Sure hope this is true
This sounds promising for consumers. But how are they gonna sustain in the long run?
"Most users likely don't exceed 20gb/month, so changing it to unlimited could be just a marketing move."
Maybe they will throttle after 20gb?
article shows them claiming it's at 4g speeds though
Fair Use Clause lohlasr time i checked it was 100GB for Circle Life
"Most likely they offered the 20GB as a test, and majority of the users that had it did not even use it to capacity (myself included). Offering unlimited for the same price would give them a huge leg up over the competition for virtually no cost. They will probably have some T&Cs to curb abuse though because that’s what will happen."
Damn I used up mine in like 2 weeks
"PSA: note that their current terms and conditions has a fair usage limit of 100GB per month, because they've always had a $3/day unlimited addon which works out to around $90/month. This is likely to stay around if they do start to advertise their ""$20 unlimited"" addon.As a point of comparison, M1's fair usage policy is 50GB a month for their $98/month ""unlimited"" plan."
"Their $20 for unlimited has a different T&CUnlimited Data for $20Unlimited Data for $20 is an option (“Plus”) which provides the User additional 20 GB of 4G+ speed and unlimited 1Mbps throttled speed after full data allocation consumption for twenty (20) SGD available within a given month. Once activated, the Plus will auto-subscribe after each monthly Billing Cycle by default, unless the User deactivates it. Circles.Life reserves the right to alter the throttled speed limit at their discretion.Only if you boost using the $3 unlimited data per day (i.e. $90/mth), then the cap is at 100 GB per month."
Thanks! Is there a link to this somewhere?
"It's in the same link you linked to, below the section on 'Data Roaming Cap'."
Can confirm! From live chatting with the customer service on live chat.
"The comments on their Facebook is exactly why Singapore doesn't have adventurous marketing attempts. Chances are they will offer unlimited data up to x amount before throttling, to keep themselves relevant to MyRepublic's boundless data."
"To be fair, you gotta know your audience in any marketing campaign. It's kinda like not going for something overtly and unnecessarily sexual in a conservative country."
Go for $10 for 10gb by Starhub's $25 SIM only base plan 3gb and 100min talk time!
"Or you know, stay with circles and get unlimited for 20 bucks"
Or singtel's $20 SIM only plan for 20gb data instead of 13gb from Starhub
Wait what singtel has a new plan? How much talk time and messaging? Any weekend free data or what?
the starhub one comes with unlimited weekend data though. Only downside is no free messages
"So over the last few months, they attracted new customers like mad, then stopped the promo?!"
They're upgrading it from 20gb to unlimited
Hold your horses guys the fb group for circles life says they’re gonna announce something so wait for it!
did they mention a date?
End of the month I think? We can expect the official announcement to be out any time soon though!
change in strategyNew keikaku.
Translator's note: Keikaku means plan

"Is SingTel the only one who hasn’t really announced any really competitive plans that boasts of more data for subscribers? Maybe they have and I missed it, but it’s as if they don’t give a shit"
They recently came up with a 20$ for 20gig as well? Or did I miss something :(https://www.singtel.com/personal/products-services/mobile/postpaid-plans/simonly
does anybody remember the daily thread whereby some of us complained to circles on the live chat and got free gb of data which they said by 15 Feb. Anybody received yet?
I did. Mine was done pretty much on the same day I think.
received on the day i asked. same with my bf
complain about?
Annnnd this kills zero mobile’s foot hold in Sg now.
This is Circles for crying out loud - they’re definitely launching something better. They always use guerilla marketing tactics to catch people’s attention and true enough it does.Excited to see how they continue to improve themselves.
I saw an ad in BV that says 20GB for $28
Omg they're offering unlimited data instead!https://mustsharenews.com/circles-life-20gb/
Makes me wonder about my 12Gb legacy plan that I have using since iPhone 3?
"Tbh, I’m happy paying $35 nett monthly (inclusive of caller ID, and I have the multi-plan discount from Singtel) and having to live with 3G.Though, the recent $20 SIM-only plan has piqued my interest of late."
I can get 4G speed as I am using M1 legacy 12GB.
"I had that, but after weighing the options i found that this C.L was better for me. (somehow my 12gb plan was $45 instead, i think cos of IDD and something else.) anyway really depends on your usage. i dont make much calls so 100min is more than sufficient. i dont use sms either, cos everyone whatsapp nowadays. the biggest pull was 3g -> 4g. i was like you, found a way to settle for the 3g speeds, its not bad, its reliable although not fast. but speed is addictive, once i switched over to 4g i realised all the convenience and speed i was missing out on. and i had so much more data to waste, for about the same price... (i added the 20 for 20)..."
I can get 4G speed as I am using M1 legacy 12GB.
Wow literally right after I ported over to circles... Fml
"Don't fret, it's an upgrade. They're going from 20gb for 20 bucks to unlimited gb for 20 bucks"
"But the unlimited GB definitely have a limit of lets say 1-2GB/Day(Except higher tier singtel plans), after which it will be throttled to abt 1mbps under Fair Use Policy as compared to 20GB straight up non-throttled. But i may be wrong anytime but from what i’ve seen from the term Unlimited (Zer0 Mobile, CL Unlimited Whatsapp and all), this should be the case."
"Based on T&C you still get 20GB at 4G+ speed, then unlimited at 1Mbps"
This is really confusing. The email gives us a deadline of March 1st but doesn't reveal what the alternative plan is. I know some folks are super excited about the possibility of getting unlimited data for the same price but even if this were true there will likely be caveats. Leaving your long term patrons in limbo is not a good marketing strategy IMHO.
They are announcing the alternative plan tomorrow. But many redditors have already sourced that it could be $20 for unlimited data. But we'll see how it goes
"I'm disappointed to see the ""free whatsapp"". I understand why they do it, but I don't think they should be promoting Facebook in that way."
Isn't it a prank? They used to do all these slightly more adventurous marketing stunts.
"Existing circles user here, am I able to upgrade to this plan? From my $28 per month for 20 gb to this?"
"Doesnt look good, last month they discontinued their Whatsapp Roaming Passport, which was 1$ a day, and i used it tons on all my travels, now they discontinue the 20$ for 20$ plus option... pretty much everything why i signed up for is gone now."
"They missed a real good marketing opportunity there. They should have said they were discontinuing the 20GB plan because they were going to introduce their unlimited plan instead. From the terms stated, its seems they are not going to throttle after 20GB and i could not see an actual limit in the terms.Edit:Upon reading other comments, the cap will most likely be at 100GB a month, which is basically unlimited unless you watch 1440p videos continuously 24/7 on youtube."
"From the terms stated, its seems they are not going to throttle after 20GB and i could not see an actual limit in the terms.From another comment, they'll throttle you to 1Mbps after your extra 20GB."
"I mean even if it is slow, Its still better than their previous plan right? Free data slow speeds>Paid data faster speeds...?"
"GG. Glad i swapped to Circles way back then. I was constantly shanked by Singtel whenever I renewed my contract by having pay more for the exact same service. I am now a few months into Circles and they announced unlimited data. Throttled or not, its really amazing."
So they aren't even offering an alternative? How do I get my unlimited data now...
"I thought I could get more info from the email, but that's all it says."
"Yeah. If they say they were upping the price, then I don't mind since I make fully use of my 20gb.But if they discontinue it like this, then I'm not really sure what my other options are"
u use 40gb of data a month? o.O What do you do?
They will probably announce another replacement service. I guess meanwhile getting the $3 unlimited/day for data heavy days might be a good alternative?
They're offering unlimited for 20$ now

XD-meetup.com(holding off for now and the amount of badminton group man)-go for some workshop(broke af how can)-volunteer(still searching and maybe some recommandation)-tinder/okc/bmc(trying tinder&okc now)-apparently there are some meetup planned here by some redditer?"
"Depends what social circle you’re breaking out of an breaking into. Get a new PT job, make some new work friends, use PT job money to go to some workshops, learn new skills and get a better job and make new work friends.... repeat..."
Try peatix too? They have free events listed
"Volunteer work (Church, old folks, reform inmates, trouble youth, cancer patients, events — such as chingay, ndp, marathon), there are a lot of groups and can meet new people, while doing something meaningful. Can try both local and overseas too. Also, there are free workshop like from Apple where you can meet people and learn new skills.Or pickup a hobby and you get to join the group / forum where there’s meet up and going for competition. E.g - Card games communities have a lot of opportunities as you have to meet people to compete and exchange ideas with. Even online gaming communities have meetup and go out together, there’s a lot out there so hopefully you can find something that interest you. (Got chance to meet future S/O through meet ups too)"
"I actually look at some volunteer work ytd, but seem like most of them r looking at least 6month commitment and im not sure im rly 4 tht + im not sure whn im going ns as well. Hmm, i wasnt awear tht thr are free workshop, will look it up.I did saw ALOT of badminton grp at meetup.com, so am considering."
"If you like drawing you can check out oic singapore, they have regular sketch walks and portrait drawing sessions, but you have to bring own materials."
Volunteering is definitely a place to expand your social circle. I would say people at animal shelters are definitely friendlier and more approachable (at least to me). If youre okay w animals definitely do try out.
I would REALLY love to volunteer at animal shelter but.... Req is at least 1yr commitmemt i wont be able to as im going ns in i dont even noe whn
"I know alot of places do ask for a required period of time of commitment, but not all do follow through it. You can email some of the animal shelter and ask if they are okay for short term commitments. Afterall, all these organisations do somewhat depend on the goodwill of volunteers, so they cant exactly be so fussy about it either."
"Hmm, thats good to hear, guess ill try my luck and c hw it gos. Tkx for the input"
"Hey lovely Redditors of /r/singapore!I'd love to start volunteering on a weekly basis (weekdays only).Problem is I'll have my 2yo with me as I don't have anyone else to watch him for me. He's a well behaved kid and good with independent play, so if there's something that I can do for a couple of hours every week where I can bring him along and let him play in a corner while I do stuff, that would be great.We also don't have a car so somewhere in the east or central would be preferable - we live in the Katong area.If this is impossible, that's fine too, guess I'll wait till he's older.. I can't think of anything and just wanted to see if you guys had any ideas before I give up? Thanks very much!"
"You can volunteer with nParks. They have weekday gardening sessions at various parks. Your kid can play around the park, or help you do weeding etc.You can sign up at http://vms.nparks.gov.sg And see what is available near you.I volunteer Wednesday mornings in Bishan Park. I find it quite enjoyable working in the park."
I've never thought about that! Great way to get the kid outdoors too. Thanks for the idea!
thats nice of op to think about volunteering even tho she has a toddler :) fighting!
Aww thanks very much!
"I can't really suggest anywhere, since a child around that age range still requires a lot of care and attention.A lot of organisations would prefer if you are able to concentrate on your task. It can be a safety and manpower liability for them, since you cannot stray too far from your child and someone must be there to attend to it's needs.If you insist on volunteering, then head to your nearest community center to see if they have any elderly engagement sessions that can cater to your needs, place your child in child-care then looking for NGOs or even consider digital/virtual volunteering programs which you can do at home like...Be My Eyes which connects you with the blind and you try to help them to identify items on their phone or this website here to see how you can do volunteering at home."
"Thanks for your input! Yeah as said in the post I'm definitely just looking for ideas and if there aren't any good options, I am fine waiting till he's older. There's a few great suggestions down the thread that I might try out ☺️"
Look into orphanage or old folks home?
"Yeah, I think the hospice might be more receptive if you have a young child tagging along.I just did one cny event yesterday for cancer patients, basically just needed to help the staff manage the folks in wheelchairs, ensure they get food and drinks served at their tables.All folks love having kids around, especially if you have a charming one :)"
time to get pinched cheeks xD
That's a great idea! I'll see if I can find something near me. Thanks!
Check out dayspring center. It’s a center for single/unwed/ troubled mums and their babies. You can volunteer play dates or mummy support.
That might work really well since toddler can be an active part of it! Thank you for the suggestion :)
My grandma wanted to go to Kitchen.mart to buy some affordable cooking utensils and I found out that they closed down.

CANNOT DEPLOY HERE.
AK47S FOR EVERYONE!!!!
TIL there's such a law
A good move.
I'm fine with this as long as women can rape men too. else there's no equality.
"Sexual assault now applies to women too. I get your point that it's weird for rape to still be men only, but sexual assault provides identical punishment as rape.There is not perfect equality but let's not pretend that it's completely not there at all."
"The very idea behind the necessity of current penal code reforms (prior to which you can sue a spouse for sexual assault) is that of fair labelling in reflecting the severity of the offence, and the conceptual idea that a married woman can be raped - which legitimises their grievances and allows them to speak out/report it more.The exact same benefits would apply for recognising rape of men - it is not just a matter of the identical nature of maximum sentences."
"I don't really agree that that is the point of the current reforms.Martial rape exception is an ancient law written by dead white dudes. The same guys also conceived of rape as something you need a penis to do. These laws have to be updated, in particular martial rape because the principle behind that was that women give lasting consent to sex once they get married. Thst kind of thinking is just no longer applicable today.I think one thing that is holding back a full redefinition of rape is that if rape is amended in that way then we'd basically have two identical offences between rape and sexual assault. One possible work around is to increase the sentencing for rape and then expand that the definition of rape to include women rapists. Of course this takes time and had to be done in steps."
"Hey I'm a guy here and I am quite curious, how does one prove that he was raped by a woman? For women it is quite clear and cut, do the rape kit, check for semen. I can't think of a way to definitively prove that a guy was raped."
"Usually through both victim's and suspects statement that will be scrutinized carefully and through cross-examination in court. Psychiatrists would usually be involved also, and witnesses (both defence and prosecution). This is how people who got sexually abused when they were younger are able to bring justice to the perpetrator even after some time. But it definitely requires the victim to have good memory and give consistent statement. Physical evidence is not always necessary."
not pretending. but marital rape is quite different from that with a stranger
"I don't really get your comment.Women can commit sexual assault in marriage too, and that would carry the same sentence as rape by a man in marriage."
"marital immunity applies to rape, revoking such immunity means the wife can claim she was raped and the husband can claim he was raped by her as well.it is unclear as of yet if a married couple can be sexually assaulted by each other under the law.so until the bill that allows men to get raped is passed and tested, don't be fooled by the media into thinking sexual assault is rape and rape is sexual assault. because they are set out as two distinct events.further the proposed amendments to allow men to be raped needs to be tested in the courts first since I would find a very appealing argument that those definitions are considered foreplay and therefore may or may not constitute rape even though it is set out in the definition (subjectivity of the circumstances). which begs the question can a married couple sexually assault each other? I could paint more explicit pictures to elaborate on how the law could fail unless tested by a judge. however I do not wish to be banned.the lack of marital immunity could lead to false claims of rape in estranged couples or those going towards or seeking a divorce it is an exceptionally complicated issue because you simply can't prove consent."
"Uh yes married couples can sexually assault each other right now, because as you yourself points out the marital rape exceptions protects rape, not sexual assault. Rape and sexual assault are under two different sections in the penal code and the sexual assault section has not marriage exception.Foreplay is not a legal term, and not a legal defense. If something meets the actual legal requirements under the section for sexual assault, the offence is made out.You can go try sticking your penis into a girl's vagina and pull out half way saying it's foreplay. So long as she did not consent to the whole thing, the ""foreplay"" is irrelevant."
""
""
"This is an overdue piece of legislation which seeks to address acts committed by a violent segment of society which rape (and usually also abuse and beat up) females who are married to them.The social workers and law enforcers see this happen so often but because there is no written law which states that raped women are protected from their rapist husbands as the latter cannot be charged since there isn’t a marital rape law, this new law is entirely necessary to address such violent acts.Many women who are raped and abused dare not tell or report because they know they are not protected. And violent, criminal individuals take advantage of this loophole in the current legal system. We are finally addressing this and it’s a good thing."
Women's Charter review when?
Good.

Getting some first day jittersEDIT: going to kranji camp 2 BMTC 5
"Your BMT life is gonna be pretty slack. Next week you'll be having this ""Amazing Race"" where you'll get to go out of camp around the Yew Tee area. For your batch, you won't get to throw live grenade sadly. You'll be posted to Bravo company, maybe platoon 1.The guys at BMTC Sch V are there to look out for you. So just follow instructions, and don't get into any trouble. Your BMT will be a breeze.Pssst.....Tomorrow's lunch is Western."
What’s Bravo company? And why no live grenade throwing?
"In sch V there are 3 companies. Alpha,Bravo and Charlie. Alpha enlisted yesterday. A company is made up of platoons, a platoon is made up of sections and each section has a certain number of soldiers.Charlie company is for the vocational training.The reason for not having live grenade is probably safety concerns in spite of the recent incidents."
Cuz you're not combat fit
"False. I’m pes c9 l9, non combat fit but I threw live grenade and did live firing."

I'm sooooo looking forward to see some major disruption to the HR/Hiring industry. Interviewees being able to give feedback and evidence of the hiring process.Shaming trashy employers and their ridiculous questions.
Love that man. Glassdoor was a good initiative but quickly became a marketing site.
Yea it would be nice to have a website where people can anonymously review their employers or comment on hiring processes. Wish there was something out there.But how would such a website make money to cover operational costs if they don't sell themselves out like Carousell with Caroupay?
Glassdoor still works fine.We have some local forums like salary.sg which helps

Starts from the job hunting process itself.No idea if the job is real, open or even the company is serious (including jobs bank from Gov as the posted dates are 6+ months old)Auto reply mail with the standard reply ""we'll get in touch with you if you are shortlisted""Interview process of 6-8 rounds, various tests and a friend told me once that he was asked to code during the interview :|HR negotiations. What was your last pay? Seriously? Why would you be worried about a different company comp structure? Isn't it supposed to be confidential for that company? or How can you value the individual based on the past and not about the value you want to get in future?The lengthy, & long process going over months (one company came back to me after 4 months :| )If a company behaves like this, how could even they expect to get good talent?"
"Coding during interviews is standard for tech companies in different countries. Lots of people cheat during the automated screening tests, so they want to make sure you can actually code. Usually it'll be an hour at most."
"Usually it'll be an hour at mostNote that if you're applying for a developer position at a big tech company, the interview process will have a lot more than 1 hour of coding.When I interviewed with Google, I had a 1 hour long phone interview followed by a ~5 hour long on-site interview, which consisted of 5 * 45 minute long sessions with a lunch break. Every interview session was a programming test."
Yeap. Imo you should be worried if the place doesn't have a coding interview and it's a technical role.
I guess I have to agree.
HR negotiations. What was your last pay? Seriously? Why would you be worried about a different company comp structure? Isn't it supposed to be confidential for that company? or How can you value the individual based on the past and not about the value you want to get in future?It really is more of a trying to squeeze the most of you for as little as possible.
Guess so. Went for an interview and the negotiations were horrible than Pasar Malam. HR Director started like they are doing a favour by giving a 10% hike to my last pay. My ask is nowhere near the 10% and I shared politely that if it's for 10% I would have stayed back. When I mentioned the expectation and I still regret not taking a video of that person's reaction. Anyway didn't continue the negotiations as it was waste of my time and their time.
""
""
a friend told me once that he was asked to code during the interview :|what's wrong with this
"My friend, welcome to the real world.Main problem is that many companies have this sort of ""hiring or not hiring one more person will not cause the company to shut down, but if no one hires you, you will be desperate for a job"" kind of mentality. So they can take their time to cherry pick from the applicants.Also, with how simple it is to submit resumes nowadays, HR has a lot of applicants to choose from and thus will take their time to find one that fits their criteria.Not to mention conflicts of interest between management on the hiring process. E.g. HR might like this guys attitude but technical might think this guy's knowledge isn't up to task. End up the entire interview process will quite some time.As for the HR asking about the pay, it is mainly more for market analysis. Knowing how much companies in the same industries pay so that they are in a better position to negotiate with you for a lower salary."
it's not my job to help HR do their job of knowing the market salary. They should offer how much they think they value the candidate and start from there.
"Yes. I'm not advocating the fact that it is right for applicants to tell HR their prev salary and let them do their market analysisIm just stating the fact that HR asks for your prev salary, so that they can do market research and find out what other companies in the same industries are paying. Of course, its more for the benefit in terms of cost saving of the company rather than the applicant."
"""hiring or not hiring one more person will not cause the company to shut down, but if no one hires you, you will be desperate for a job""Yeah, I see that. Unfortunately, that's what stopping the innovation or disruption and promoting group thinking. No Risks, no alternative views, no changes to the routines & make sure there is a fallback plan (point finger?)"
Interview process of 6-8 roundsWHAT? 6 - 8 rounds? For C level position?
My previous job required three interviews and two tests. It wasn't even a managerial role.
"That's 3 interviews. I think that's fairly common.6 - 8 rounds, Who did the interviews? The In laws? I'm just flabbergasted."
"I had 7 rounds with Singtel for a ""senior"" role with junior pay"
"Easier for higher level though. Manager , assistant director, director for NC$ and Singt&! don’t have to go through so much. Which also result in inadequate level of competence and lack of technical / managerial skills.There’s a lot of micro managers there too (some would even time your toilet / lunch break, but it’s okay for them to disappear for hours). They care more of you physically being there where they can see you than actual productivity.Also, you’re getting junior level pay might be due to cert. These SG companies don’t pay based on the job / role. In the same team can have different pay, so enjoy getting paid less while doing the same job as the rest. Should try going for actual international MNC where they compensate you based on the job and not your cert."
I'm in an actual MNC now taking 3x of what Singtel offered.
Oh woah which Mnc if you don’t mind? My jump offer was only 1.5x from 1 of the big 4.
"Sorry, prefer not to talk about it."
"I'd check out by the 5th round and head elsewhere.7 fucking rounds, that's bloody inefficient. Seriously, I highly doubt there was a need there for 7 different interviews. Did you speak to the ALL the departments? Related or otherwise? lolAny insights on what the different rounds were about?"
I can say it's true ;) Been there done that.
"I've had 8 different interviews with 12 different interviewers, with a top investment bank at the end they still rejected me."
O.M.G. Are they all so unconfident of their own choices that they need so many people to give consensus?!
"Usually its because the team is small and the fit is very important, as you will have to work long hours in a high pressure system with each other.As you can imagine, any sort of personal conflict will be magnified when people are stressed and tired, so it is important to make sure everyone on the team is comfortable with the new hire. And as you can see, interviews are really an imperfect way to assess someone. Even with 7-8 interviews, thats only 7-8 hrs of time spent. Multiply that by the number of interviewers and you can tell the company is actually serious about the hire., because they are investing their time into the hiringBest case scenario is of course putting the new hire through a work scenario, which is why internship hire are so much more preferred as they are literally working with the new hire before hand.Conversely, a place that hires you after just 1 session is probably urgently filling a spot, and know that interviews are 2 way streets, so it also means you dont get as much time to assess the company and your future colleagues."
"Yea. That's just bull, it's seriously inefficient. You can have multiple people sit in to do the interview, that's one. Or have the heads to decide if the person is a correct fit for the team.You can't have to go through that many rounds of interviews to decide, seriously. There should be a good idea whether a candidate is suitable after 3/4 rounds imo.Even you agree that interviews are a poor way to access a person's fit to the work required, team dynamics and all. So how's another 4 more sessions of that going to help?Obviously, these are just my worthless 2 cents. I'm pretty riled up because I think these are a waste of everyone's time, especially when candidates invest that much time and no hire. To me, it's just too many cooks, bystanders who have nothing to do with the hire and chefs who cannot decide."
"Happy Cake Day!What’s the typical number of interview rounds one usually has to go through before being hired? I’ve personally applied mostly to the CS and there’s never been anything less than 4 rounds, including psychometric tests... it really sucks to have to keep taking leave for interviews but no choice right lol"
"Well, I mean typically 2 - 3, 4/5 if they have a more complicated process. Anything above that, I really think it's a waste of time."
"Hmm, if you switch it around, what about the time invested by the interviewers? Instead of spending the time on the work, they had to carve time out for a one on one or two on one with the candidate. They, in your words wasted 7 hrs as well to do the interviews.Sure we can do round table interviews, 7 on 1. And just like a group outing, how much interaction can you have with a single person?Hiring someone essential to the team is like starting a new work relationship. Its important for both parties that its the right fit. Any company hiring you after 1 interview is probably for an unimportant, easily replaceable, not valued position. Any organisation who takes hiring seriously will have multiple rounds. Its the ones hiring after 1 interview that you have ti watch out for, as that means they dont care that much who they actually hire.Although having said that, some places might be inefficient. If you feel that way, its also a way for you to reject the company due to their hiring process, as it is a red flag. So it is still valuable info that you can take away from the process. More importantly is to have that time spent so you can do your due diligence on the company as well."
"I'm not saying that interviews should only be restricted to a single round. 2/3 rounds should be sufficient, heck I'll give 4-5 rounds if the role is really important or the hiring process is more complex.Even you agree that it's a waste of time for the interviewers. Do you see my point? How much time is wasted? On both ends? 7-8 rounds of interview to decide if a candidate is worth it, someone's head should roll for the decision to have that many rounds."
"Not really, I dont see your point. If I’m hiring for a position, I would want to make sure I’m hiring someone that will help me do my job better. It takes a lot of time and effort for me to deal with a wrong hire. And the business suffers in the mean time. And now, after 3 months I would then have to let this chap go because he or she is not up to the task, and initiate another round.Unless Im hiring for a non important role, which in that case, yes I agree probably 7 rounds is excessive.What I don’t get it why do you think it is excessive? Its as much a problem for the company if they have a wrong hire, so they will of course need to hire carefully.Please also note, in my example 7 rounds is probably consist of 3-4 rounds with different team members and managers, and the technical competency tests, and the group interviews stages, which might include informal drinks, coffee chats."
"I'm not saying that it's not important to hire the correct person. I'm not saying that technical tests, group interviews are not important.I'm saying that, your 3-4 rounds of interviews with different team members and managers are excessive. You mean you are that ill confident of your own decision? Aren't you heading the team because you can make the decisions?Even if you want to make sure the candidate meet the team members & managers, won't a single round or 2 be sufficient? Get a general feel of a candidate, make sure everyone is comfortable? You mean everyone needs a heart to heart talk to the candidate? Everyone needs their question answered? Are these match making sessions? I'm quite sure you are dealing with professionals that work in a team?If you are interviewing a C level candidate, head of an important department candidate, or a role that has to have many hands in many depts and people, I'll give that you want to have that interaction as much as possible. Outside of that, if it's a regular team player, not that I am saying that's not an important role, 7 rounds??? For real? I'd personally think by the 5th round, you should be able to tell if the person is up to it. 7-8 rounds means there's a bunch of incompetency with the interviewing company.Well, at this point, I'll have to say that I am not seeing whatever you are seeing. I'll just have to agree to disagree. Any more replies from me will just rehashing what I've been saying and saying over and over."
"Hey, never thought of it that way before. I’m currently in the midst of job applications and always rolled my eyes at the amount of hoops they made applicants jump through. But what you brought up actually makes a lot of sense!"
"I’ve a hunch (also based on anecdotal experience of people I know) that the lower the barrier to entry of an industry, the more likely you are to face such crappy HR processes. Quite simply because every applicant is so easily replaceable. The nature of the work is such that there’s no shortage of people who can and are willing to do the job. So HR is relatively “powerful” and has no qualms with putting up all these hoops for you to jump through."
"Interviewees should definitely speak back if you notice bad behaviour. Like seriously, what's the worst that can happen -- you don't get the job. At least you still have dignity rather than work in a company that doesn't respect people."
Yes. Totally agree and hope there will be more info in sites like Glassdoor.
I called an ex-employer out on Glassdoor once. She managed to throw her weight around until they removed my review 🤷🏻‍♀️
"I think 7-8 rounds, if done without meaningful assessments is a waste of time. Unless every individual involved is unbiased and is genuinely looking for someone with value to bring onboard. Or it could be looking for someone to fit the mould. I think interviews should be limited to 3 rounds at max because let’s not forget that during this 7-8 rounds, there are going to be other companies competing to hire this potential one too."
The funny thing is that Human Resources is one of the most useless and unnecessary jobs out there. The toilet cleaners have a 10x more value added job than those HR lackeys.EDIT:Editing to say that cleaning toilet is a noble job. Don't mean any disrespect to those cleaners who are trying to survive and get by. HR on the other hand..
Sorry you got downvoted by all the HR people eating snake at work
"Commentary: When demeaning job interviews and bad bosses are still the normThat's really offensive, there's no such thing as useless, it's how the HR industry find value for themselves."
Cause hr is to benefit the company not you the employees or potential employees.
Rude. HR is probably one of the toughest jobs because there are so many different expectations to meet and it is all people related. Every situation is going to be unique. If it was useless then it shouldn’t be one of the most in-demand jobs la.
"I am a hiring manager and I have a team of several dozen.HR is useless.They don't write JDs They don't do screening interviews They don't do fit or culture interviews They don't help with evaluations When it is time to help our employees skill up they just say ""use google, go find course lah"" When they do something administrative they screw it up like put the wrong compensation on a contract or cut/paste from someone else's contract and keep the name/IC from the originalHR is in demand because only idiots go to HR. If you're smart, motivated, detail oriented and ambitious you end up as a recruiter (even your own firm!) and make a lot more. In-house HR is a parallel to in-house IT: its where idiots go who can't make it on their own."
"Oh man, just your luck to have such a HR team then. Sounds like they are entirely hands off in recruitment and even other parts of the employee life cycle. Sibeh good life then!My team delivered those services :)Lots of recruiters make their way in-house too. So it’s really because of your poor experience that you form such judgement."
"Fair point.I will be slightly less bitchy and more even-handed.I would love to have a competent proactive strategic HR team. In reality in the past 3 companies I have been in across Singapore, Hong Kong and London at best I have had transactional HR which does what they are told and at worst totally incompetent.In my current company, HR reports up to a global head of HR they are totally disconnected from the business. Their focus is on meeting their KPIs.Story time: I had a meeting with the APAC head of HR recently where her complaint was that I wasn't meeting her KPI of all positions to be filled within 60 days. When I asked her what help she is offering to me to meet her KPI, she told me that her team was too busy to help hire and that they were focused on other more strategic thing!So yes, HR can be a competitive advantage and differentiator. If I can find such an HR manager or director who doesn't want to go make money as a recruiter I would love that but so far, I haven't had such luck.Don't get me started on marketing people now... :)"
Wow. Recruitment is the toughest bit and your HRM gets to skip away from this task.Now I get why you are so pissed. And 60 days to fill is a bit hard to achieve these days if you don’t have a TA team maintaining an active pipeline for you.Hope you have better luck!
"Thanks for the kind words...We're working through it with my team doing the screening and the initial interviews but they're sales people, they dont know much about this kind of thing.Also I dont really want them to be involved in the comp and bens part and the compa ratio which HR doesn't even provide. They just forward the latest Mercer reports and tell us to work it out ourselves and send for their approval.So if you're an HR Professional (with a big P) then you do have a lot of upside potential cause there are businesses like mine who would love to have you. The downside I suspect is that our HR department is underfunded so you pay peanuts...you get monkeys."
"Hahahah goodness. My heart is with you, but I got my ass kicked out after my maternity leave cos the business decided my team was too pricey to fund that they really just needed HR to pay and hire people only.Yeah, so weird to get your team involved in the sourcing and selection, the C&B matters will be very hard to keep confidential. And good luck, good sales people are so hard to find now!"
And therein lies the problem. HR is underfunded so doesn't attract smart motivated people
"Just when they made attempted suicide legal, I see you Singapore."
"Just thought it was insane anyone would think this up, tried it and its mediocre at best. The patty is too dry (but could be because I ordered through delivery)Also, does anyone actually eat this as a burger rather than deconstructing it? I feel like this is their 2019 version of the double down."
double down was actually good.
"Agreed. It was calorie cancer, but god damn was it good."
Imagine double down mcspicy

Mac and cheese patty in a burger is not unusual I think. Had it in Australia at a cafe (fantastic) and in johor (not as good but not terrible).
sounds like my kind of food.will try it out soon
It's actually not too bad. Just wish they didn't bread the mac'n'cheese 'bun'.
"Oh I thought the Mac & cheese was a spread, didn't know they turned it into a patty.That's.. Weird.(Yet to try it tho)"
Do you actually eat it like a burger or break it down using say knife and fork?I can imagine the ‘buns’ exploding in my grip and dripping down my elbows
"the mac is so hard, the crust is so oily that it soaked through the burger wrapper. oh god."
The wrap around the MAC and cheese bun taste so jellyish. Had to deconstruct the burger to eat it
Just tried today. It's very heaty. Three pieces of deep fried together. This is way more heaty than normal two piece chicken. Normal Zinger meal is better. As least you know what you are getting. Wish I had read this post earlier.
Got a fever from just looking at it

"In Singapore, we born-and-bred Singaporeans are all instinctively socialized to respect all religions because all the main religions are represented in sizeable numbers in this island. So, that isn’t the issue. The issue is ash and smoke swirling around at 2am close to residences. Clearly not conducive to those who are asthmatics or suffer from allergies. If the bins are at isolated spots then it’s far less of an issue."
"If they have to burn it at such a specific timing, I think it is only fair that they have to respect the fact that it causes disturbance to others.Putting in thoughtful measures such as burning a smaller quantity of incense paper or putting the fire out with a bucket of water to prevent the ashes from flying all over the place goes a long way to show that they actually care about minimizing the disruption caused to everyone else.These folks who burn large amounts of incense paper without caring about the well being of others, simply using 'Tradition / Religion' as their defense are just selfish."
Its not that he purposely wanna burn at 2am. Its the timing for the tradition. Just like muslim pray 5 times a day and have a certain timing. I would say its town council fault? Since the bin is placed there by them.
"Chinese here. Burn is ok, but at least have the courtesy to move it away from buildings. In this case, he can bring the bin across the road. If we dont cherish the privileges, and when its gone, its too late to cry."
"When you are on ground level you won't know the wind direction on higher levels, and since the bin is placed there people will just burn without second thought. Best is to make a report so the govt authorities will have paper trail and act upon that."
"Moving across the road will help much, the wind will still blow in the same direction. I lived on the 25th storey and I can still smell burning ashes opposite my block. Learn to give and take, close the window and its settled."
"Yeah, best solution is to close the windows. Smell hard to avoid, but by moving across the road, it can at least reduce the smell and ashes from flying around. For this case, there is a huge open space across the road. So there is no doubt that the other side is a better placement for the bin. someone should have shift it to there.But cannot put all the blame to the guy, because he might have encountered difficulties in shifting the bin to a new place."
"Yeah I agree completelyAlthough I also think its on the onus of us, the public, to write in this sort of small matters. When oversights happen at least we are part of the solution and get it done too"
people also scared to move the bins around right?? So the TC must exercise more common sense also lah but most of the time it's the supervisor tell the Bangla worker to just out around.
Usually when u go down the bin is already hot and burning. Unless you are to first person to use then you can move.
burn incense vs health. religion vs tradition vs culture. doesn't have to come to this
"Health more important.Why burn at that time?If want to do that, then go find somewhere further from where people are living and sleeping to burn.Or burn earlier so the affected neighbours can close windows / turn on aircon before they sleep."
It's burnt at that time because the Hokkiens are praying to Ti Gong
either you're young or a troll
"IKR, his username does not check out at all."
"There are many religious idiosyncracies la, if everything talk by right and logic, its really hard to live in harmony in singapore. Best is just to live and let live especially if such occurence do not happen often. This is Singapore after all.I never forget what my mother once told me after i grumbled to her about noise levels from the wedding at the void deck below, ""boy if you are unhappy about other ppls religious practices, go live in a cave or jungle, dont live in Singapore."""
I'm ok with void deck wedding. I'm not ok with the contingent of cars honking loudly before 7am on a Saturday when everyone is trying to rest.
"To me, if groom has reached to fetch the bride, he can give a call before honking. Honking 1 time ok. Honking multiple times is an asshole behaviour."
Yeah. Any form of vehicular sounds as a mark of arrival is verging on a deliberate act of nuisance already.
"probably not the issue at hand, but clearly this guy picked on this chinese uncle 80% because he looks meek and easy to makan and maybe 20% whatever others things. highly doubt this will be happening to a gangster looking uncle with ang kongs and shit."
Such a polite confrontation.

13.5% of households earn over 20K per month....wtf??!!
How is that surprising? 20-25% of each cohort gets into local uni. Starting pay for local grads range from around 3.5-5k.Imagine you start work at 3.5k. Give about 10-12 years even in civil service with one of the slower pay growths you will hit 10k gross. Two average graduate couples in their mid-30s to early 40s should be earning that much already even if they are not stellar performers.
Is graduate but can't ever imagine getting 10k gross. :( #poor #lookingfor10kspouse #please
"Good read to kill time.Median monthly household income is 9,293 or per person $2,792.If your household income is >30,982 or household member income > 13,581 then on 'average' you are in top 10% earners.Interesting:It is notable, for example, that some resident employed households in the lowest 10% owned a car (11.3%), employed a maid (11.8%), lived in private property (7.0%)HDB 3rm dwellers received 4,535 / per person in grants or transfers while landed residents received only $3,152 :|"
"It is notable, for example, that some resident employed households in the lowest 10% owned a car (11.3%), employed a maid (11.8%), lived in private property (7.0%)Could be rich retired folks with no income."
No income from work... These are folks who hit fatfire and is just coasting on dividends or business owners
Maybe also no kids. Want to adopt me?
"HDB 3rm dwellers received 4,535 / per person in grants or transfers while landed residents received only $3,152 :|IMO this is how inequality gets perpetuated. Landed property owners, who are the most asset-rich class of persons, gets more than condo owners in transfers. They are also ONLY 1.5k annually behind in transfers as compared to a 3-rm flat. What is 1.5k in a year? An extra $125 a month to take bus/mrt? How are we going to really address inequality if we are only giving families in 3-rm flat a $125/month head start as compared to landed property families? Should we even be giving landed property owners so much in terms of subsidy? Why should we let landed property owners keep their expensive properties while taking subsidies at the same time? Just so that they can pass it down to their children and perpetuate entrenched inequality? MPs keep telling HDB owners to downgrade their flats in retirement when they need aid but never ask the same thing of these landed property owners. Why the double standard?"
"Tend to agree on the gist but the spiral is due to many other reasons. Getting our of poverty is much more harder than we all think.For the grants, the devil is in the details. The 'transfers/grants' consists ofNew SG shares, NS50 grants, GST Credits, Senior Citizen bonus, Pioneer gen/Silver gen packagesWIS or Workfare bonusesUtility rebate, EASE or Digital TV stuffEducation subsidies (Edusave, Subsidies on Primary, Secondary, Tertiary or SkillFuture)Baby BonusHealthcare subsidiesIT rebate or Property Tax rebateSo it may not be 'direct cash deposit' to offset costs and we don't have to worry about giving a lot to Rich landed folks. For example, if one guy going to NUS Engineering pays 8,200 / year and enjoys a subsidy of 30,000 :|"
Haha. Agree.I thought it was laughable that landed property owners get more subsidies than condo owners for one.We need to re-introduce estate and capital gains tax.
*looks at my CPF statement*
"This reports summarizes the income trend of working families only, meaning working stiffs and peasants. And the Gini index presented is calculated solely within the context of this subset. It is somewhat disingeniuous to claim that the country's Gini index is the best in a decade when you exclude the families who are truly destitute with no working member as well as the families whose primary income is from asset ownership, businesses or who just had plain old grandfather's money.You know the saying about statistics and data being like bikinis.

Finally someone who puts the focus on a guy with HIV willing to hold HIV people as leverage.
"Farrera-Brochez first obtained the HIV registry, he said, after recovering two laptops that had been stolen out of his apartment by somebody who Farrera-Brochez believed was having an affair with Ler. Having noticed that some of his files were missing, Farrera-Brochez uploaded a program from the internet to recover them. That’s when the registry popped up, Farrera-Brochez said.wat."
FBI WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
"FARRERA-BROCHEZ FIRST OBTAINED THE HIV REGISTRY, HE SAID, AFTER RECOVERING TWO LAPTOPS THAT HAD BEEN STOLEN OUT OF HIS APARTMENT BY SOMEBODY WHO FARRERA-BROCHEZ BELIEVED WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH LER. HAVING NOTICED THAT SOME OF HIS FILES WERE MISSING, FARRERA-BROCHEZ UPLOADED A PROGRAM FROM THE INTERNET TO RECOVER THEM. THAT’S WHEN THE REGISTRY POPPED UP, FARRERA-BROCHEZ SAID."
"He has a few understandable points. It's valid to debate the necessity of the HIV register, and he was correct that medical records were not sufficiently secure.That said, his methods make him a ridiculous hypocrite. He leaked the records to prove that the records would cause harm if leaked. That's like planting a bomb in a crowded place and killing 100 people, then saying that you're an anti-terrorism activist who opposes the government's lax security which might lead to loss of life."
"But is it his place to comment on and also to take such drastic action?Let's be honest, he didn't do this out of some altruistic reasons to improve the condition of HIV sufferers here."
"He has a few understandable points. It's valid to debate the necessity of the HIV register, and he was correct that medical records were not sufficiently secure.please lah this is just bullshitit was vengeance plain and simple"
He did say he went to the MOH to tell them their security is lacking; if what he says has truth in them then I’m just helplessly confused by our own police’s reactions to the matter.
“Oops the HIV registry had been unsecure. Let me make it even more unsecured by letting everyone know the contents”
He also claims he was raped and tortured in prison and made a daring escape. ¯_(ツ)_/¯
"You dropped this \To prevent anymore lost limbs throughout Reddit, correctly escape the arms and shoulders by typing the shrug as ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ or ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯^^Click here to see why this is necessary"
Doesn't matter even if he did. He had no permission and no right to steal the data. What's so confusing?
"Listen to him to do .... what exactly? The only people who suffer are his fellow HIV sufferers.“Farrera-Brochez said that he told Ministry of Health officials on multiple occasions that the registry had been compromised, but they didn’t act. When asked about the 2012 complaint he’d made about Ler, for purportedly revealing his HIV status, Farrera-Brochez said he wasn’t referring to his own status but rather calling attention to the breach of the registry writ large.”=“I don’t have HIV and I dont know about a leak.” And then “I got ratted out by my Husband for having HIV” and then after that “actually it was because of a leak”Right..."
"Why does it seem like redditors here are trying to justify his actions? Is this some kind of white privilege?He obviously has no good intentions.

Changi City Point
SSShhh !! Don’t reveal the secrets !!

Tanjong pagar area has quite a few bars that are significantly less crowded.
You can try those near to the chinese temple. Forgot the name of that area.
not OP but is that the Thian Hock Keng temple?
Amoy street! There’s this fu lin bar quite quiet
"Tomorrow being Valentine’s Day is an awful day to go out, across the board. Cook something at home and show her where the heart is.Remember chefs and restaurant workers have boyfriends and girlfriends too."
There's a forlorn looking Harry's in the Velocity building by Novena. It has all the ambience of a bank branch but it's usually not crowded at any hour.
I know a few bank branches that are 100 times more lovely than that Harry’s. They could do so much more with the outdoor space next to it as well
The bars at Holland Village are kinda quiet when it's not Friday
Tuckshop on Guillemard
"Hard to find a good quiet space in sg, especially on valentines day.Ever thought about buying stuff back home to avoid the crowd? That's what I usually do."

I know its a decision I have to make myself but I think hearing what you guys used it on could be easier for me in decision making."
I suggest udemy cause their course is cheap when it's on discount.
The courses are forever on discount
yup but people who don't know will accidentally buy in full price.
"Genuinely asking, udemy seems like they are conducted as something like online lectures (e.g. for programming) . So how is it different than watching YouTube tutorials which you can access for free?"
"Free courses have limited information. Majority of the the course are video based which is true. I find MOOC websites more structured and comes with discussion forum, quizzes, assignments, Q&A’s, an interaction with instructor which are quite important while learning. One of the python course I learned from, provide me me a folder consists of notes lab practices, assignment and projects that can be access from jupyter notebook. I also feel that I will learn by putting ""money on the line"" which helps fund for future courses make by the lecturer. If I don't like the courses purchased on Udemy I can refund it within 30 days."
Icic. Thanks for the detailed explanation. Saw that there are some courses having valentine day discount. Tempted to try them also. LolHmm. But what is your opinion on the certs that they give out? As in will employers recognize a certificate which is obtained from an online course as compared to one from a registered institute?
But what is your opinion on the certs that they give out? As in will employers recognize a certificate which is obtained from an online course as compared to one from a registered institute?This one I don't know cause I haven't start working yet but future employer will see that you are willing to learn/upgrade yourself.
Ic... alright thanks for your replies!
"The certificates from udemy especially are usually useless as there is no curation for udemy courses, of course there may be those from reputable schools companies but usually recruiters will only take that you took moocs to improve your skills, those on other platforms like edx with curated courses are another ball game altogether, some of them even provide actual college credits abeit not in sg"
Will you recommend to use edx instead of udemy? I only finish 1 course from udemy which is Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp
"Oh boi if u want to learn data science there are many good and quality free resources from Microsoft IBM blah blah, can't rmb them off the top of my head but iirc datasciencemasters.org has like a list"
"ok, do you think it's worth getting a verified cert for 99USD"
"Try applying for financial assistance :/ if u really want the cert Worth of certifications for moocs depends largely on companies and recruiters.Most will actually skimp past moocs certification declared inside cv (akin to just knowing u took moocs), if u got past the initial automatic vetting or eye check and get into an actual interview, try linking stuff to the course u took like oh I learn how to perform data cleaning after taking course x on platform z, then elaborate on the actual process, it would have more effect than oh I got a certificate for course x. This applies to mooc certs in general. For other certs like ccna, aws certification, they will definitely help u ( aws cert exam alone is actually pretty cheap, just that training u may want will cost a bomb, and they only last two years)"
ok thank. I currently only got ITIL v3 foundation cert not counting that 1 course I took in udemy.
"Enployers will only see that you took some effort to learn this area, but it still wont be enough. Best is if you did projects (if you’re learning programming) to prove that you’re able to apply what you have learnt to have a decent chance imo."
"I see. Thanks for the info! But in your opinion do you think employers will recognize project and enthusiam rather than a degree?I'm asking because I have some interest and feel like venturing into IT, but my current degree isn't really related to IT, so I feel like might lose out when HR are sieving through resumes :/"
"Yeah projects will definitely help. Maybe you can include a github link and list down projects that you have done.Once you’re at the interview stage, you can just talk about your projects, what tools you used and what you learnt from them."
Better content because the lectures are created by people who get paid when you buy it
True price of most courses are $9.99With the exception of courses by Linux Academy
"Is it time for me to plug this again? You can access Lynda for free using NLB account :) On spending those credits tho, most people I know spend them on courses that costs a few thousands like AWS courses but reimburse with discounts + sf credits to offset. Most cheap ones are ehh quite meh"
Pick up a new language or something
Drone training? Since you are in photography.
"I don't see myself using drones a lot, for the work that I do. Drones are mostly videos, and its kinda niche. Plus it ain't cheap."
Used $150 on the handyman course by Homefix XPC.
this. same here. i also did the carpentry part which was very DNT ish.anyway the trainer was slightly knowledgeable i feel.
"Spent mine on Basic Sports Science from RP, as a prerequisite for the swim coaching cert from Sg Sports Council. Then spent the remainder on the CELTA to teach English as a Second Language. Pretty much burnt it all."
"Used about $90 on the following courses on Udemy. Although most of the content can be found via online, I think the Udemy community was quite good in answering questions that I had.- Powerpoint (not so useful)- Excel Macros (nothing that can't be Googled, but good practice)- PMP (Experienced PM, needed the PDU hours but didn't want to go and sit 4 days in a class. Just let it run in the background, cleared the PDU hours and went to take exam)- Python & R"

You can take a specialist diploma
really?
Yes I took one up during ns but didn't use skill future although all my classmates used skill future so I'm pretty sure you can
"Interested, where can I find the course."
"Just search on the poly website for specialized diploma. Got quite a few course and many on IT stuff. I took web development in sp. It's a one year night course. Just touch and go , bare introduction but was a good foundation for my career now. I'm a freelance web developer now"
Freelance web developer after you ORD? How you study while doing NS
"I strike lottery. Kena 8-5 as something like admin take care of building. I sneak in my laptop do work while on job, after that just go study lor. Lucky for me my sir lepak and live on the way to sp from my camp. So whenever I got lesson I just go lor.Ya actually before I enlisted I already took on like 2 or 3 jobs already. But was still very noob. The course helped me have a better grasp of what I was doing. Something like coding when you just start up you may have many questions. So having a teacher explain them to you is very helpful."
"Nice but I thought specialist diploma, you need 2 years working experience."
Huh? No la. I think that's advanced diploma ah. Specialist dip requirement is just either already have an existing diploma similar or pass a basic test. And the test is basic as hell. I studied like 2 days without prior knowledge
ah I see.
"If you need a hobby to get mad at, pick up Python. (programming)If you need to enjoy something, don't pick up anything related to programming. Simple. (maybe basic GUI-based ones are relaxing, but the CLI ones make you want to die)"

"I used some of my SkillsFuture credits for baking classes, specifically chinese dimsum baking classes. It costs $125 for 6 hours.I mean I learnt some stuff, but really, $125 for 6 hours? And it's a class of 6 people - I don't think its very worth it."

"I'm surprised at the efficiency with which these ""investigations"" were carried out. Less than a day after multiple allegations were madeHe made those allegations before 2016 in an email to MOH. They investigated it back then.He said he caught HIV from getting raped by prison inmates, then he requested for HIV medications to deal with the condition.How did he even know he got HIV from the inmates? Self diagnose? Lol.The authorities said that when he was admitted into prison in June 2016, he declared he had been HIV-positive since 2008.Truth is he self declared that he got HIV since 2008."

"Lol, sometimes people don't like to hear the truth.""Better go along with the media outrage or you are a paid shill"""
Cause they know it's bs plus he was investigated
"Lol the bulk of his allegations were within the last three years - it’s not hard to dig out records, especially if they’re digital. I’m also guessing that some of the things he mentioned are things that require witnesses and record-keeping in triplicate, so not hard to provide receipts.Plus, there’s apparently previous investigations to build off of?"
"His allegations are incredibly huge. It honestly wouldn't take long at all to dig up the necessary records, such as disturbances in the prison, medical history, etc, etc."

"In total Won cheated the woman of $178,150. He made restitution of only $12,710.I know a portion of that amount was from her mother but damn, a 26 year old with over $180,000 to lend is kinda insane.She was just a receptionist as well.I'm almost 30 and have nowhere near that amount to lend."
Poor girl might have borrowed from other relatives or even worse from loan sharks.. 23 months jail is too short for this kind of cheat.
probably like $10k from her and the rest from the mom or something
"The money cheated can be never be fully recovered. Most are lost at the casino. Should there be a publicly accessible database system marking such assholes, so that they won't be able to cheat others again ?"
You can actually exclude a family member from entering the casino by law.
There's online .. and illegal toto/4d/Soccer
"Ah.. I didn’t know that. I used to work at a hotel that had a casino, so I was aware of the exclusion law heh."
"Before casting judgement of the girlfriend and the mum, let's remember that this giant asshole was willingly taking advantage of those that trusted him."
It's still kind of ridiculous how neither of them smelt a rat after 23 transactions.
More than that. 24 times in 2015 alone. And they met in late 2015. I wonder if that guy is super handsome.
"There are people charming beyond reason. I know one such person, and it's insane what he can get people to do for him.He's a great guy, and doesn't take advantage of people, but if he did, I'm sure he would get away with genocide in broad daylight."
Know some too. Most of them are big liars like the mikhy.
"Lol... so just because the asshole willingly took advantage of those that trusted him, it exonerates the girlfriend and the mum from their questionable actions?"
"Nope. Not at all.Just that the framing should be on the person who exploited their ""willingness/whatever you call it"" , rather than victim blame.They should have been more guarded yes, and super suspicious of someone taking that much money from them.Fact is they weren't and the law punished the perp and not them. It is always easy to say that they should have known better, but people get still get swindled in this day and age for a reason."
So what the reason?
"I can't speak for this news in particular, but I imagine something along the lines of love, faith, charm/smarts from the swindler.Wasn't there a recent post about the guy who lost 250k from his cpf due to his loving wife? We can pity and feel sorry for him. Blaming him doesn't help imo.People give to charity, but how often do we actually track where the money we give goes? We've all lent money to a trusted friend or relative - at times not even expecting the money back.I'm just trying to diffuse sentiment against the victim here. Yes they shouldn't have trusted the asshole, and they've already lost financially - I just don't think we should add to that by layering extra blame on them.Maybe counselling and advice for them? Maybe I'm naive and too nice. I'm just sharing my opinion here. Feel free to criticise friend."
"Would feeling pity and sorry instead of blaming the guy who lost 250k help the guy get back his money?If you’d ask me honestly , I don’t think human beings can be trusted - especially with large sums of money , may be unpopular opinion, but always be prepared to only lend what you’re willing to lose.Especially in this case where the girlfriend and the Mother literally send him money so many times, without even insisting to see any proof of what he used the money for ."
"As outsiders, short of donating to them, no, we can't help them in any way but we should reserve judging the ladies harshly. Even more so knowing how they handle money.I agree with you 100% - money lent is money gone."
And I am still single....
Indian here but yeah channel 8 had some really good dramas. Anyone remembers 'Tong Xin yuan '(portrait of family) with Pierre png and felicia chin and also 'Zero to hero' which covered paranormal stuff(and was pretty heartwarming too) .Sorry if i spelt the hanyu pinyin wrong.
hanyu pinyin on point bro!
"Am a she,haha"
"I think channel eight has a couple of good shows too... I believe part of the problem was the industry's ability or perhaps refusal to capitalise on local mannerisms. for instance some shows have great scenes only to be ruined by the actors feigning an accent. embracing Singapore's culture in the past could have made more shows watchable and hitting closer to home. that being said, I suppose we have shifted towards a more globalised culture now and my above comment is moot."
That’s why Jack Neo films are so popular despite being of mediocre quality. Nobody else captures that Singlish atmosphere quite as well as him.
"It's 'Growing Up' for those who don't wanna open the link.Also, there are many other shows that all races enjoy, such as 'Holland V', or the Nonya show which China is reproducing with some local casts!"
even today (like just last week) I was watching the Holland v Show on toggle hahaha. I am totally anti toggle but sometimes I just want that little bit of nostalgia.
"That show always reminds me of chen liping's ""死太监!"""
"I liked Holland V a lot, even though some of the drama was probably lost on me when it was aired since I was in primary school.I hated the rape arc, since it was so dark, depressing and uncomfortable. I loved the last arc when Xie Shao Guang's character started falling in love with Chen Li Ping's character. He started acting very out of character and it was hilarious to see her get grossed out."
there was also that Temasek Poly channel 5 drama.
What about Phua Chu Kang and Under One Roof? These two plus Growing Up are the Big Three imo.
Agree !
"Yeah, agree.Oh, this reminds of me being on duty when the guy who played as Aloysius(pieere png's son) was escorted into camp for db check up."
Before marvel movies there was VR Man.For the uninitiated: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWZJ-U6NSKk
"The one I remember was CLIF. I was a kid then and I guess I liked the action.But nowadays everything is so pushy with propaganda. Some have obvious ads right in the show itself. It's fucking stupid.With streaming getting popular, hopefully they start realising their money's drying up."
Not only for local shows. Local movies as well. Have u seen the local movie liang simei? Holy shit that show is trash. The amount of advertisement and the way they were portrayed in the show is crap. Can you imagine cutting to a scene where the protagonist spends their time describing and advertisement an electronic door lock?
coughAh Boys to MenI can't remember the last time I watched a piece of Singaporean media.
Pls. Its ah boys to cashcow. Lol. Milkin it like how they milked the Singapore idol craze
"I watched the recent movie with the 4 radio hosts and hated it. The extras had horrible acting, the depression thing was so easily solved they might as well have fixed the ailment with panadol, and the advertisements were done so obviously and in bad taste. There's being funny and calling shade on a product placement, and then there's the local method of doing it.Unfortunately I don't think it's really a problem of the producers, but more the people who actually watch these shows being unable to make connections and inferences for subtle and vague advertising to work."
I remember how 警徽天职 was the only show I’d come out of my room to watch. The plot twists were actually really mindblowing.
"I think there are several good shows but this is probably the very definition of ""old is gold"". Really quite a classic that I enjoyed when I was growing up, and even now when i am older too"
"You're right. Old MediaCorp shows were quite good. E.g. return of condor heroes, little nyonya, chu lu etc.. nowadays the standard has dropped drastically."
The Pupil was not bad. Triple 9 too!
"Yeah, The Pupil is pretty underrated. A pity the plot got a bit insane near the end."
Excuse me but VR man was the best
I liked Don't stop Believin
Ok chop
"早安老师。Had it all. Strong local flavor, humor, romance. Even a good theme song.Edit. Just realized you said mediacorp. Oh well."
Yeah it was my favorite show back then
My favourite was triple 9. Wong Li Lin my boyhood crush
"The Ride Home, anyone?"
"双天至尊 (The Unbeatables), starring Li Nanxing, Zoe Tay, and a pretty stellar cast I must say."

Is 东游记 that 八仙过海 one where 谢韶光 was some sandshrew demon? Because I loved the theme song for that show.
"I don't quite remember 谢韶光 in that show. But speaking of 谢韶光 , his 活佛濟公 is good too !And yes, that is the one about 八仙 . This is the link to the first episode, inclusive of the OST"
"The Legends of JigongThe Legends of Jigong is a Singaporean television series based on legends about Ji Gong (1130–1207), a Chinese Buddhist monk who is revered as a deity in Chinese folk religion and folk hero in Chinese culture. It was produced by the Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS) and was first aired in Singapore on TCS Eighth Frequency (now MediaCorp Channel 8) in 1996. Xie Shaoguang, who portrayed Ji Gong and sang the theme song for the series, was nominated for the Best Actor award at the 1997 Star Awards.[ ^PM | Exclude ^me | Exclude from ^subreddit | FAQ / ^Information | ^Source ] Downvote to remove | v0.28"

"Jokes on them, nobody will buy their oil. Venezuelan oil is so Low quality it would cost more than the oil is worth to refine it."
any source behind that claim?
"https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1CN2EOhttps://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-Quality-Issues-Could-Break-Venezuela.amp.htmlhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/judeclemente/2017/11/05/venezuelas-oil-problems-abound/amp/The disputes involve cargoes soiled with high levels of water, salt or metals that can cause problems for refineries, according to the sources and internal PDVSA trade documents seen by Reuters.Phillips 66, a U.S. refiner, cancelled at least eight cargoes in the first half of the year due to inferior quality. It also demanded discounts for other shipments. Refiners in India and China have also lodged complaints.Already very low, Venezuela’s crude oil quality has been dropping. A lack of funds has limited PDVSA’s ability to process and therefore sell its heavier grade. There has been a shortage of chemicals and equipment to properly treat and store oil, so facilities get shut down, or production is rushed to avoid delays. Exacerbating that, a flood of other factors like a fleeing workforce, U.S. sanctions, food shortages, uncontrollable inflation and violent protests have all left the government simply unable to respond"
"This is a specification list for Venezuela’s crude oil: http://www.genesisny.net/Commodity/Oil/OSpecs.htmlIn the industry, Crude oil with >0.5% sulfur needs to be refined to make viable petrol. Using high sulfur oil will damage engines and produce extremely toxic Hydrogen Sulfide gas.Venezuela’s main crude oil exports are Merey and Leona. Merry has 2.74% sulfur, while Leona has 1.52%. These are difficult and expensive to refine."

THINK OF THE CHEWREN
It’s interesting cos in most countries 0.3 percent thc is generally considered the threshold. Anything below that is industrial hemp and above that is considered psychoactive. But sg doesn’t really distinguish so every part of the cannabis plant is illegal. Actually kinda doesn’t make sense since cnb does allow poppy seeds in for industrial and culinary purposes.
"""Cannabis is clearly addictive and harmful, and there is no scientific evidence of the safety and efficacy of raw cannabis use. ""It's almost as if they think that if they repeat this enough times, it will become true in government department making a wish to the fairy godmother sort of way."
Follow the trail of Big Pharm and its hold.
If only the CNB has been that effective.Exercise: go to CNB website; they have a list of publicly released reports going back to 1997 or so. Read the 97 report. Then open the 2017 report. Tell me the difference between number of drug users arrested in 1997 and 2017. You'll be surprised at CNB efficacy at tackling that number.The 97 report haf past data of the previous 10 years or so to show how awesome the CNB was. The agency wrote a short report. The 2017 report had 2016 and 2017 data. The report is a very long 20 pages document.

If it costs me $100 to learn how to make those 2 or 3 dishes exactly the same then it would be worth it for me. I know the cooking class would make a different recipe though.Hmmm, I wonder if I can ask the cook and get him to show me."
I’m not sure cooks will be willing to share their recipes with you since that’s the only thing that sets them apart from competitors
"I know, just wishful thinking."

"If you take a red marker to draw the prohibited circle, does it count as vandalism? 🤔"
"Technically yes. I remember there was once an Aunty in her 40s or 50s. She saw a staircase landing at her block being vandalised by loan sharks or something. She painted it back to the original colour (or very similar color). The police were called in as someone spotted her. But eventually she wasn't arrested as they realized she was not vandalising. Rather, she was fixing the vandalised wall. Lol. They advised her to call the Town Council though, rather than do it herself since passers-by will react differently."
The kaypoh Kia also kum gong who vandalize with white paint!? I'm assuming she used a proper roller too!
"So using the same logic, not too far fetch idea. If I were to stand right at this post and lit up a cigarette. Technically I do not break the law?"
It's against the law to smoke 5 metres from entrances of any establishments (including MRT and Shopping malls). Its already in black and white (Singapore Statutes under Chapter 310).Sure you can argue to the judge during your sentencing but I highly doubt you'd win even if you have a defence counsel. Lol.
Yeah plus you can be considered to be smoking even if you just light the cig and not inhale/exhale smoke.
People these days really act like jerks by calling a hotline to report anything without proper facts! Sad!
"I think its cause generally don't dare to approach a matter for the fear of getting into some complication. In that case, its kinda good that people are actually reporting right rather than giving benefit of the doubt. If something bad happened, its nipped in the bud. Else, some brief investigation and they are let go. No harm done in the bigger scheme of things."

"Take out the cigarette, do not light it, just put it in your mouth until you enter the mrt station, then you put it back into the packet. Make sure you put the cigarette back in the packet in a remote location, you don't want unwanted attention from tourist or people not from pioneer."
Hang around rubbish bins and enjoy second-hand smoke.

"Although the cynical side of myself and many poke fun at how the government really benefits from cigarettes, high tobacco taxes are really a win-win situation if you think about it. On one hand you discourage smoking and on the other its revenue. To suddenly ban it outright would create widespread resentment and losing a big chunk of income.Where it gets abhorrent is when said government then bans alternative products like vapes under the guise of ""health concerns"" when they are really just trying to ""protect"" their tobacco income stream."
"Right. Banning e-ciggs and Vapes are just excuses . They are healthier than tobacco cigarettes. But since the govenement profits a lot from sales of tobacco due to taxes, they ban the e-ciggs and vapes. Lol."
Why don’t they just tax vapes too lmao
"Idk tho, but if vape was legalised, u might see more yp who smoke in open areas, saying “its not cigarette smoke what, where got second hand smoking?”"
"I don’t see any harm in that.Aside from vape smoke being an annoyance for it might be constantly be in your face, I’d rather inhale vape smoke instead of second hand smoke. What you are describing could be an annoying situation, yes, but I’d rather live with that. At least vape liquids smell nice."
""
millennial privilege i guess
Yeah agree. That is an area of concern too. Might encourage youngsters to start smoking. They'll think Vape is harmless. Then will slowly transition to tobacco ciggs.
Why transition to tobacco when vapes are cheaper and you can always get a stronger liquid?
Curiosity. And vape taste very different from smoking ciggs actually.
"Hmm ok, maybe there are people out there who will like the taste of tobacco. I have both vaped and smoked. Much prefer the taste of vape, so even if I tried ciggs for first time, it would be my last."
Aren’t vapes worse for health? What I think is good is that small thing u can clip on the end of the cig so that the smoke doesn’t come out n give second hand smoke. I see that a lot in japan
get informed.https://news.sky.com/story/almost-half-of-smokers-are-unaware-vaping-is-less-harmful-than-tobacco-research-11592996
"I thought it had less tar and Tabacco (probably why the colour changed) but same or more of other harmful stuff. The very first wave when it came, it seemed like it was far less harmful, it was only after that more reports started popping up that it wasn’t as “healthy” as people thought."
"Two words: popcorn lungEdit: A friendly reminder that 'less harmful' does not mean 'harmless'. Whenever you see articles claiming that e cigs are less harmful, keep in mind that there simple isn't enough info available at the moment to determine the long term effects of vaping. The harm of e cigs is also highly dependent upon the substance vaped. Diacetyl is a known cause for popcorn lung, and it is found in a lot of the cheaper, fruity (marketed to teenagers) vaping liquids. Although there is no documented case of a vaper having popcorn lung, it is important to reiterate that the effects of long term use (and long term secondhand exposure) are still largely unknown.I feel the need to post this every time some sycophantic article about vaping gets linked. Get informed indeed."
"Seriously, if the government introduced legislation for eciggs it would be so much better.No vaping outdoors, only indoors and at approved areas. e-liquid to have the same laws as cigarettes; only sold to age 21 and above. Eciggs to undergo safety mark certification. What's the issue here?"
Revenue that don’t go back into the system.
"Outright banning it would also typically lead to a huge black market of cigarettes, which would make it harder to control as suppliers would either smuggle more aggressive or attempt to make their own with (possibly... Maybe???) even more problematic impurities.In most cases for nearly anything around the world, banning something tends to create a black market for exactly the thing you're trying to get rid off, usually in much much worse quality."
"I'm really curious where this rhetoric of the govt trying to ""protect"" the tobacco income stream came from though. Was it from a report or just popular speculation turned truth?"
"""MOH is committed to lowering smoking prevalence in Singapore through a “comprehensive, multipronged approach to discourage and reduce the use of tobacco products”, the spokesperson added.""Literally the first result from ""singapore ban e cigarette vape"" and every subsequent news item. There is no other logic behind banning alternative tobacco under the above excuse while still allowing cigarettes."
"The sentence you quoted did not say anywhere that it was trying to 'protect' the income stream though, just that it's about discouraging and reducing the use. That's what I'm curious about because from all I've read and googled there has never been a reliable source about tobacco as an explicitly mentioned income stream. And tbh it was a genuine question, you didn't have to be so mean and snark in your response. Thanks for googling it too though."
"I think the frustration arose from the fact that you were looking for an explicit admission for something this obvious which, at least expecting such from our government, is deeply naive at best. Regardless, I realized how it came off and went back to edit it. Sorry."
"It's alright, thank you for being patient and even apologising about it. I was hoping maybe there would be a commentary from someone about the issue as well on this."
What if you're out of smokes?
Then u get fined boi

"Against cigarette addiction?! Since when sia?Multi-billion dollar tobacco industry and also putting fines for specific smoking ""violations"". Have you any idea how much money is made from this? Then, people get cancer and chemotherapy helps earn another part of money out of people.Tobacco is one of the best business to get into. No government in the world would be dumb enough to completely abolish it."
Would having more people being ill would be unproductive for the country?
Then why do cigarettes even exist in the first place? Ever thought of that?They are profitable. Too profitable. They are profitable for multiple industries to not have in a country.The government can do things to make it restrictive and that makes it look like they care.Reality is that they do not. It's the money it brings them that they care about.Think about it. Even making it restrictive comes in the form of fines.People being ill still earns profit somewhere. Your medical bills are subsidies by who?
"Cigarettes exist because it's a multi-generation habit that can't just easily ""abolish"" without bringing it down into the black market which is more dangerous because there'd be no more regulations like tariffs, sin tax and packaging guidelines to make cigarettes less appealing and accessible.Governments don't need to depend on cigarettes for revenue, because the amount is minuscule compared to economic policies like tax rate (income tax/corporate tax and healthcare model/appropriations.Without revenue from cigarettes and alike, governments save money from granting healthcare needs like lung problems.While tobacco industry plays a big role in the economy because of macroeconomics, it can always be abolished once the time is right (like now—new generation, gradually). When tobacco is gone, new industries will emerge OR existing industries will thrive from increased consumer spending diverted supposedly from cigarettesNB: Cigarettes are all imported products from mostly multinational companies. The Singapore government benefits very little from Marlboro's bottom line."
"All good points except your last line. Tobacco tax revenue consistently exceed 1 billion dollars annually, hitting 1.2 in 2015 which is almost double of what's collected from road taxes from every single vehicle on the island that year. There are alot of ways to describe how Singapore government is affected by Marlboro sales but ""benefits very little"" is not one of those."
"I've strike out the last paragraph. But again, I believe this isn't the govt fault at all. If you believe they are evil for benefiting from cigarettes sales instead of blanket ban, your best bet is to not buy cigarettes in the first place.I think the govt policy is just killing two birds with one stone. They aren't that evil as it purported to be."
"I'm not saying it is evil although it may seem that way if you want to talk about ""good and evil"".It's just how the world works, isn't it?Nicotine/tobacco is addictive, corporations market and sell them to make money out of it. They pay governments so that they can keep doing their business. Chemotherapy is another market that cigarettes ""benefit""."
"That is definitely not in Singapore. Foreigners do not get into politics in Singapore. Local businesses don't get to influence govt policy to benefit themselves because lobbying is illegal in Singapore.You're thinking too too much. The world is evil, but less sinister than you perceive."
"Huh.. How could you possibly say that with such certainty? Government is run by humans and humans, can be greedy. You hear news about different people being part of other countries' government all the time doing unspeakable things.Just because we don't know does not mean it does not happen in our country too. For all you know, they are probably so good at covering themselves.Our government or any government is not 100% transparent so forgive me for being somewhat cynical."

"There are so many choices in Singapore that it is hard to sieve through all of them, unless you are really sure what you are looking for. Sometimes, small but good outlets also get lost in all the information.It would be great if you guys could share what you have participated in ( sport/ martial art/ gym membership or any type of exercise really ), the location and price range. A list of personal pros and cons about the classes would also be helpful. Hopefully this thread might aid others who are also looking for places to exercise in Singapore."

"Not precisely a sport per se but I have gone for basic Shinkendo classes for a good 2+ months & it has been very enriching, really. Compared to usual Kendo which focuses on competitive sparring, Shinkendo teaches holistic Japanese swordsmanship & not so into competition :) It may not have any practical usefulness in this day & age but it's a good workout for your core muscles & trains you to stay focused as you learn how to draw out/hold/maneuver the sword (also there's some elderly folks singing karaoke next door the dojo in Toa Payoh South CC so extra practise for concentration :D )$120 in total for the 2 months, once a week. Discounts apply if you sign up as a PAssion card member. If interested you can pm me for more info :)"
Sounds fun! But so far..... Do you guys use a shinai or a boken?
"For the beginners' class everyone uses a wooden bokken for kata work & light contact. A shinai, whilst straight & rigid for sparring purposes, does not replicate the structure/curvature of an actual Japanese sword.oh btw, a live shinken is only used for tameshigiri (bamboo test cutting) in Shinkendo :)"
"Wait, what? You guys do live cutting?!"
"Er nope, only the seniors who attain the 1st rank (aka ""black belt"") are allowed to do the cutting under supervision of the sensei :)"
Ah right. That makes sense. Pretty cool still though
How much did you have to invest in your gear? Uni had kendo clubs and stuff but the cost was a lil prohibitive :(
For Shinkendo a good wooden bokken is the only thing needed for practice as there is no investment in heavy Kendo armour. No one wears armour in Shinkendo; intermediate/advanced students just invest in a white gi uniform & hakama. That's it! :)note also it's not compulsory for all Shinkendoka to own an Iaito (unsharpened katana) & it's entirely up to your discretion to own one. A white oak bokken will just do fine for the classes :)
"Oh wow, thats news to me hahah. Always thought gear would be an essential bit of any form of practice. I'm guessing this is because there's minimal contact sparring?"
"more or less :) even if there is alot of contact sparring between the more proficient Shinkendoka, everyone ultimately uses the bokken for basic training (though the seniors can bring in a wooden naginata, yari, the laundry pole used in wushu & even lightsabers after class for funsies :D) If interested you can drop by over 1 Shinkendo class to have a look :)"
Every year I participate in IPT and RT.
"I went for a few trials and free classes. Those I went for consisted of fightg, 9round fitness, and yoga+. Those I am planning to go for are bxg boxing and fitness, anytime fitness gym trial and revfight club.I'm open to more suggestions regarding any other activities. If anyone has questions about the trial classes I have attended I can try to answer them too!"
I recommend 9round too! Especially for beginners.
"If you are into MMA, you might want to try grappling?I do Brazilian Jiujitsu and the classes are like this: warmup > drill techniques > rolls (sparring). Some gyms learn a certain technique for a week so that you may remember it more, some are quite versatile, a few techniques may be taught throughout the week.MMA gyms are generally in town areas, ranged around $120 - 350+. Usually they have access to gym equipments, so if you don't feel like taking a class for that day, pure gym training works too.Facilities may not be the best unless you go to Evolve, but it's adaptable."
The bungee classes at dancevault is pretty cool. https://www.shape.com.sg/fitness/first-ever-bungee-dance-workout-singapore/
Oh wow. It looks rather interesting
"Currently on Evolve membership.But this is ONLY for people who are strongly committed to MMA.Currently they ONLY offer annual plans at about $5,000 ++. So unless you're willing to go 3-4 times a week (to make your cost-benefit ratio worth it), I'd say think hard.Otherwise, quite a worth option to look at!"

Do you have a budget in mind?
"Yes, I personally wouldn't go past 200 a month. But feel free to recommend anything higher if you feel like the benefits overshadow the price."
"Yeah don’t think you need to spend so much. If you are looking for a combo of mental and physical wellbeing, then I’ve been to this workshop where they teach stress-relief techniques and breathing exercise for $300 over a 4 or 5 day period.You learn something which you can practice on your own daily for 20-30mins. And it is recommended you come back for group sessions where you do a longer version together, and all you need to do is pay $10 for each follow up session of yoga/meditation and breathing exercises.Aside from this, I think CCs offer a good selection of classes at prices like $80+ for 12 sessions also."
"Hey there, this post is also an update to my previous post where I left my wallet in the bus - a kind soul has returned my wallet to me yesterday morning and I've thanked the person myself.Now, since I've deactivated my existing credit card and am waiting for my replacement card, how long does it usually take to receive the replacement card from them? Am having trouble to withdraw money without my card XDThanks!!"
The higher the tier the faster it is. Got mine done in 2 days before.
hmm within a week?
Bank can issue on same day as request. Jus head down to the bank. U may need to give them time if it is very busy period of the day eg lunch. I got mine in 2 hours two weeks ago. I went for coffee and they messaged me I went at 930am
"Let them know that you need the card for a overseas trip the next day and they'll usually send a courier over.I left my card (Citibank) at a shop, and got it back. But because the numbers were exposed, I asked for a new card to be sent to me.However, because the next day I had to leave for my vacation, they were nice enough to courier the card over to my office."
"Correct me if I'm wrong - 'withdrawing' money from credit cards is not a withdrawal, it's in all essence a loan with interest to pay for it, isn't it?"

"So I at Lavender and this y’all Ang Mo dude started to ask for help, telling me that he’s a banker in Malaysia working for HSBC, that he got wasted last night with his friend and lost all their stuff.He asked me for money, like $16 because he needed $40 for 2 tickets bus ride to KL.It was pretty sketchy to me, I even searched for the tickets and it was $40. So I decided to just trust him that he needs help and I went to withdraw my savings which wasn't a lot.He gave me his WhatsApp and told me he’ll return me the money when he reached back home and I’m not sure whether I did the right thing.Edit: He replied my text, he said he’ll pay me back in a few days, if y’all want another update.Update: He told me his name was RobertThis was our convo https://imgur.com/a/NXzwvVBAfter searching the number he gave, it wasn’t a Malaysia number, it was some number from Hawaii or something.I’ve accepted the fact that this was probably a scam and I’ll learn from this. Thanks everyone"
"Some people would rather get scammed now and then, than to chance passing up someone in real need"
It's sad that in Singapore we'd assume that this is more likely a scam than not (and probably rightly so).
"But to be utterly fair, the most common crime in Singapore is petty scams."
No worries. I'm from the States and I would immediately think this is a scam. This is the most common scam in my city. Like for reals.
I wonder if OP would have helped if the asker was Asian instead of white.
"Because this kind of people exist (at least in KL)I got approach by a suspicious couple in KLCC too asking for RM50. But so far, never happened to me in Singapore.If they ask for bus ticket and you feel generous, accompanied him to buy the ticket directly at website/ticket office so you know it's legit"
"The best thing to do for someone who asks for money to buy stuff is to buy the stuff for them. Then if it's legit they will be grateful and you just helped out someone in need. If it isn't legit, you just avoided a scam. Win-win"
"Agree. Also, I feel it's just a matter of exercising your own judgement,""Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.""The person who I've helped previously may also have a harder time convincing me should he approach me again.Still it's your money, do what you feel is right I guess."
It's a common scam in case you aren't unaware of this.
"I got scammed when I was in paris helping a ""designer"" who needed money to do some travel to italia (around 80 euros). OP, just take it as a learning lesson, and it won't prevent you from helping real people in need one day. People who scam just allow you to learn how to protect yourself from next time."
I mean that is how they sustain themselves in the long run though.
"Banker, right? He could have proposed to use a smartphone instead. Log in to his internet banking account and wire cash so that I withdraw it at the ATM for him. In addition to taking a train or plane back to KL (instead of bus) he could have had some spare money for proper meal and drink :-))."
I proposed that when a farang / ang mo tried that scam on me in BKK. Suddenly he had reasons not to wire the money .
"Charge him an overnight interest rate of 20%, compounded daily, until he pays you back.He’s a banker so will completely understand."
good one :)
You’re a nice guy. I’m an Ang Mo myself and woulda told him to go fuck himself
"I am a local and I find locals live in a bubble where they think everything and everyone is safe and nice. All one has to do to make a quick buck is hold a coin can with some stickers on a busy street. People will donate without understanding what they are ""donating"" to."
It's not just locals - those of us that have lived here any length of time start to drop our guard too. That said I guess if you've only ever lived here and/or not travelled much you might be more susceptible. I had to tell a local employee off before because he checked his work laptop into the hold on a plane we were taking - he hadn't thought for one minute that a baggage handler in Indonesia might be inclined to swipe his new MacBook...
"Yup, once you live in Europe for a while, you learn to avoid people asking for ""bus money"" and to run far far away when a gypsy approaches you."

I always whip out my phone and offer to help them call the police who can bring them home. someone who is really in need will appreciate that offer. oddly enough, the ones i meet always give some excuse or curse at me when i do that :)"
"Better to be safe than sorry. Sorry, but this world ain't so black and white. Hope you learn from this."

"you should direct him to the nearest police post. If its legit, he will be willing to make a lost item report. Pretty sure the phone and wallet of a banker is valuable enough to any banker that they will not mind making a police report."
^ help but be smart :)
"Offer to phone the police for him, so they can come there and file the police report with him. If he gets nervous about that, that’s your signal that he’s a scam.Heard stories about someone giving a sob story about a stolen laptop and wallet, needing money to get home, but when offered to call the police so he can report the crime, he had no interest in doing so."
plus the insurance will always need a police report
"You're way kinder than me. My way of thinking is any stranger that comes up to me in public is trying to separate my money from my wallet, be it insurance agents, credit card people, flyer distributors or scammers.So I just smile and ignore everyone.Reminds me of this one time I was walking to the mrt and this girl from prudential shoved a small box in front of me and went ""for you!!""So I immediately said ""No thank you!"" and kept walking and she followed me.Girl: But I haven't said anything! Me: No, thank you! Girl: It's free! Just take! Me: No, thank you! Girl: I haven't done anything! Me: No, thank you! Girl: Are you Singaporean?? Me: No, thank you!She finally gave up lol."

Haha yeah I’m still studying so...
"It’s ok, I know someone who ‘loaned’ $30k on 3 separate occasions via one online platform to who she assumed to be separate people.This after I had saved her from one cat fishing scam just a year or so ago, when she asked to borrow $30k cash, so she could put it in a bank account, so and her ‘friend’ can put the proceeds of her house sale into that account. I told her it wasn’t logical then. She had never met or spoken to that ‘friend’ in person. Lucky she didn’t go ahead with the plan then because she never heard from that person after that.This current occasion, she has maxed out her 3-4 credit cards and gave away all the savings that she had. Now, the police and bank can’t help her because on paper, it looks like she gave away the money willingly. She complained to the online platform and they shut down her account and deleted all her logs. She also got threatening emails from the scammers, warning her not to pursue the case.$50 is a cheap lesson if you realise that you were completely and utterly scammed. Never give money to a complete stranger - they can easy contact their friends and relatives for help, esp. if they are some high flying banker."

You did the right thing. If you get your money back you helped for someone who was in trouble. If you don't get your money back we all learned the lesson. Win-win.

"Did you try to buy the tickets for him? Even if you don't know how (easybook.com), you can suggest it as a way of testing them.This applies to a lot of calls for help. If someone asks you for food, offer to buy something for them. etc. etc."
I once gave an old man 10dollars because I had no small change n he said he needed money for bus fare.I'm not singaporean but he definitely is.I'd say you should keep that kindness and give when you feel you need to. Just don't do it when it's your last 50.:)
"Applaud your generosity even if you might have got scammed. What I would personally do in this situation is buy the bus tickets for them, never give cash."
I would have bought the tickets for him rather than giving him the money.
He works in a bank. So there’s no where else to get money but by asking people in the street?
"TBH, when I give or lend money to strangers I don't expect it back. Otherwise I won't give at all. That's just my policy. 😀"
You wouldn’t have given the money if it wasn’t an Ang Moh. Serve you right.
"Harsh but true. OP isn't the first and won't be the last to get scammed, so this needs to be said."
Not sure whether to upvote cos kind hearted or downvote cos gullible...
It's not gullible though. He knew the risk and went ahead anyway. It's a kind thing to do.
He sounds horrible :( please don’t get scammed again
"and that my friend, is life's tuition fee for youif someone had stolen his stuff, he wouldnt even have had a passport to get on the bus back to kl"
You got scammed dude.
I just met this guy - gave me the same story and he just seemed really sketchy.How much did you give him?
"Urm, how is he gonna get out of the country if he lost all his stuff and I presume his passport?"
I would have kindly told him yo fuck off back to his white homeland
I like you already.
Uhmmmm dudeeee. Scam.
Wasnt legit....
I have been scammed like that before !-_-
"Live and learn. It’s obviously a scam. Don’t be so naive next time or else it could end a lot worse for you.Also, if he’s texting you, does he have your mobile number as well? Another big mistake."
I encountered something similar too. Was at JE Mrt couple of years ago when this rather young looking (pre teen?) ang moh boy asked me for ten bucks to take the train. He looked rather flustered so I obliged. Made sure he bought the tickets before I left. Never got my money back though. I hope you get back yours!
"You should give him money. Source: I’m angmoh.Seriously, are really being so naive and believe in his story?"
Pls update if you ever get back the money lol. Wonder why he asked you of all people?
"Never trust anyone, especially sketchy looking people"
"Should’ve asked him if he know what an embassy is.Stupid banker from hsbc, seems legit though. Source - was a gloried salesmen there beforeAlso, got access to Whatsapp but cannot transfer money? This scammer really do know what bank to associate himself with to show incompetence."
"it's this kind of people that really ruin the faith we all have for people.many years back when i was still young student, this moderately old lady approached me asking for money (cant remember how much but it was affordable for a student) to buy food. i gave without thinking because she might really have needed help. when after i walk off, i turned my head and saw her counting her large stack of $10s.from there, similar incidents happened time and time again until now im always skeptical when people approach me for help(donation)."
You got scammed. His name is actually Bob
Broooo..
School fees paid.
"Next time, tell him go call the Embassy. That's what they are there for. But yes, don't expect to see your money again.A story - I was told by these European guys that they would go backpacking through Asia, run out of money, then just go to their Embassy and said their money got stolen, and the Embassy would buy them an air ticket back home. It was a common tactic. Can't remember which country it was, one of the Scandavian ones I think."
"Hearts in the right place.! This shouldn’t deter you in future I hope.Guess look out for the gaps in the story, the banker story is too ridiculous, could have directed him to the nearest HSBC branch or his hotel or a free Internet cafe for his next of kin contact."
"I'm sorry but this shtick is just too common in Malaysia. No matter if it's a 70 year old ah ma or Ang mo, the story is always similar. For me, the best way is to always offer to buy them the thing that they claim they want. They need money for food? No worries, let me take you to the nearest food court and I'll pay. You need a cab? I'll book one on my app for you. With enough encounters, you'll notice that they'll always say, ""oh. It's ok I just need to cash. Don't wanna bother you bla3"" That's when you know if their plea is legit or not. And, let's say they take your offer just to ""follow through"" with their act, and then threw that meal/ticket away, at least I get the satisfaction of knowing that his time was wasted and gained nothing from this."
I think we're missing the point that OP has only <$50 in his savings. Withdrawing $16 is more than 30% of his assets. Kudos to you OP.
"Don't feel bad, good lesson learned! Sob story scammers are found everywhere around the world, and they have many creative variations and can be super CONvincing.There have been a number past cases in Singapore before as well, such as at Chinatown, Clarke Quay, Bugis, Changi Airport or anywhere in town. Usually perpetrated by foreigners.An infamous example in the past was that of a well-dressed Chinese pair who claimed to be here on a business trip and even came with business cards!But in some rare cases, pitiful looking local elderly have also been seen doing such things.https://travelscams.org/asia/common-tourist-scams-singapore/"
was him being Ang Mo one of the trust factor that you decided to help him?
"Good question, I think it might have been. Shows how our perception can screw us up."
"Are you male or female? I'm curious to know which demographic scammers are targeting. For one, I know scammers love to target students because they are gullible."
Scam. Why he asks you for money when the real problem is his passport?How can he got out of sg via bus without passport?
Hmm. Normally quite a skeptic but for some reason I think this guy will return your money.
Yeah i think so too. Where got people scam you alr still reply your messages one hahaha
"Maybe he is just having fun trolling. I mean, $16 is not much money perhaps he is just doing something that was on his bucket list (to scam someone of a small amount of money). Who knows why; people do strange things in life."
Would be really wholesome if he does!
If you ask enough people you’re sure to find one sucker. People are still falling for the nigerian money scams as we speak even though it has been around for so long.
Or OP is just CSBing.
Posting here to check on update.
"Ang Mo + HSBC means he will most likely have a LinkedIn account.Also, where's his passport?"
"I don't see anything wrong with being kindhearted. If you insisted on accompanying him to buy the ticket perhaps it would've been a better assurance, but don't let the downers get to you for being a kind person.This happened to me once too, but it was a China man asking for taxi money. It was a pity I heard a similar story from a friend a few days before I encountered him, so I told him sorry. Offered to guide him to the police for assistance but he quickly left the area after making an excuse.."
Not gonna comment on your situation but just wanna say I really applaud you for acting out of kindness. Kindness is such a neglected quality and I’m very heartened to see it present in young people like you :)
"he’s a banker in Malaysia working for HSBC, that he got wasted last night with his friend and lost all their stuff.Should look for policeHe asked me for money, like $16 because he needed $40 for 2 tickets bus ride to KL.Can direct him to Malaysia embassy."
"Whenever I decide to help someone financially, I am prepared to lose that sum of money. Not that I am willing to be scammed, but most of the time, if the person is so desperate to approach me for money, chances are he/she won't be able to return it. Help within your means."
"I never give money to Ang Mos. This guy is likely a begpacker.https://observers.france24.com/en/20170410-“beg-packers”-white-tourists-who-beg-southeast-asiaMany times they all have similar stories about how they have a high paying job, and how they will return the money. DO NOT give them the money unless you can afford to part with it."
"Respect that you helped a dude out, even if it is a scam, doing good deeds is it’s own reward.I have a much higher opinion of those who help even if there’s a chance of scam compared to those who don’t help at all.Then again, best if it’s not a scam lmao."
Update us if he returned the money or not
I would have fallen for it - on the premise that perhaps one in X is genuine. But it does break your heart knowing the odds are not in your favour.
"What would you have done if you had lost your phone, wallet and passport? Ask a kid to lend you half his savings?"
Go to the police station. I'm sure they'll let you make a phone call at least.
Good point of view. Yeah I don’t think I’d be comfortable asking a kid.
"Quite late to the party here, but I just want you to know two things:1) Always help in kind rather than in cash; and2) Please don't give up helping people just because of a few bad eggsI've been scammed a couple times in the past, and it's something I do now as a matter of habit - if someone asks me for money to buy food, I bring them to a food centre and let them get what they want; and if they want transport, I order them a Grab (which is tied to my paypal so they can't take my money unless they're in cahoots with the driver, in which case, I'll slow-clap). But giving them cash has too much potential to go wrong, as you've probably seen, and there's something crass about having your good intentions exploited, so, for your own good and theirs, help in kind. And it helps screen people too. :)"
"the way I look at it, angmor or not, scam or not, whether you got cheated of what ever you had left is not the point.you believed you did the right thing by helping another human, if he was a cheat, then he's scum, but you had your heart in the right place... so good on ya. Faith In Singaporeans (slightly) restored."
What's wrong with you? How are people so gullible?!
Did you at least get his name? You can publicly shame him if he doesn’t return.
John Doe. Please don't shame me :(
"Did the same thing couple of time for some China Chinese, Singaporean uncle who bullied by wife, India teenager, etc at various place - VivoCity, MRT station, bus station, food court, etcLearnt the lesson - IF THEY NEED HELP, THEN HELP THEM TO THE MAX OR NOT AT ALLIf they need a bus ticket, accompany them to a bus stop, pay for them, send till their doorstep.If they have to cross Johor / KL, joined them and have a one day adventure :)If they need food, buy for them, feed until they flipped, no point helping people half way.If they are scammer, they will just need your money.If they are indeed need help, then your sincerity will make God cry :)"
"Encountered a lady 2 weeks ago, seemed like quite in a panic and stopped me to ask for some money. She said her mum's in a hospital and needed me to follow her to go pay the bill which was about $365. I'm not really in a good way myself (have been jobless for about a year too and $0 left in the bank that day, my odd jobs pay not in yet)I apologised and said myself I had no cash, but I gave her the last $20 I had for the cab fare. Hope she found the money.(She said she will return my $20 but haven't heard from her since). Maybe I was scammed, maybe not. But oh well, I always have a soft spot for these people, maybe they really are in need. And having been in situations where $2-$5 is important for my meals too, I always give."

"It's not a judgment call, it's the decent thing to disclose the breach the affected persons!"
"Please, it’s not that simple. Lifestyles are at stake here, perhaps ignorance is bliss? Perhaps disclosing the breach would in fact draw more attention to the data and cause further damage? There are many factors to consider, and you could argue for both sides, but there is no straightforward answer. This IS a judgement call."
If they warned everybody on the list but not the general public I would have been fine with that.As it current stands it is a cover up.
Disagree that ignorance is bliss.This is particularly because they cannot guarantee that the data will be safe indefinitely.It would have been responsible to at least disclose said breach to the affected persons.
"Disclosing the fact to the affected is responsibility and basic decency. If your credit card number were leaked by the bank, would it be right for them not to tell you? Ignorance is bliss?Sure, call it a judgement call then. An extremely bad and irresponsible one at that."
Clown should have been sacked long ago. But this is Singapore
"I think they should have warned the affected people but not make this public. On the flip side, warning so many people probably would make it go public anyway"
The bins are there for them to do it. They should not be burning on the pavement.They probably know but are doing it willfully because no one enforces it. You should probably tell them off.
Take a video and submit it along with your complaint to the TC.
It's called being an inconsiderate asshole
It is a fire hazard and should be reported.
"We have so much space on each hdb roof top, I don't get why we can't construct a safe space on the roof top got them to burn. It won't rise up to all the flats, won't litter anyhow and won't be a nuisance."
Might be because it is harder to put out a fire on a rooftop if it happens?
Ouh that's a good point
Have you thought the ashes would flow down into the homes of the other residents?
Somewhat relevant poll: Should there be more enforcement against indiscriminate burning in HDB flats?
Get out there with a fire extinguisher
"Ritual to god, respecting elders, Culture. Whatever it is, by causing inconvenience to others (& getting their curses) and vandalising property doesn't do any justice to the intention."
"Technically it's vandalism, can we charge them?"
"Won't get investigated/enforced. Now, if it was drums during Diwali or a Malay wedding..."
yes it is because you are Chiese.
Dare I say it but this is Singapore. During Taipusam (I believe I spelt this wrongly) they ban drums. Liondance trucks spamming their drums as they drive past okay. Indian cook curry they make noise (I believe people here know which incident I'm talking about) Chinese folks burn and let smoke fill the sky oh it's religion/culture and we should not say anything.Why?
Oh we all know why
"Not talking about drive-by drumming. I was in Tampines Mall yesterday and there was a lion dance troupe performing outside Courts/Popular, with the Nigel Tufnel Memorial amplification. That mall is already one of the more acoustically live places in the East Side; I and a dozen or so other mostly older folks had to go outside. I was just coming out of Popular at the time, and the decibel meter app on my phone registered 127. For a half hour? That's beyond inconsiderate; it's assault.Since the days of the God-King LKY, we've been proud of being ""more Chinese than China"", as I've heard from many. But even Chinese folks only get one pair of eardrums in this life..."

The gents (why is it always gents?) one floor below and two floors above me smoke enough (cheap but not inexpensive) cigarettes that the smoke is strong enough to trigger breathing difficulties even with my door closed and aircon doing its very best.

Lol. Gotta love em grandmas! 🤠
Yep shits me all the time - especially out here in the burbs sigh
Is this in Tampines？
"Just wanna share a different POV. There aren't enough bins for so many devotees who want to burn the offerings at the same time. Also they burn a large amount of offerings, not just a few stacks of joss papers but like huge structures. With a lack of space, I can understand why they choose to burn the offerings at places other than the bins."

"I'm enlisting at Kranji Camp 2, BMTC School V tomorrow morning and I would like to know from my seniors, if possible about what life is like at the camp for a new recruit. I have read that this camp was opened only recently, around August of last year. Any and all help will be greatly appreciated!"
"First few days nothing much, a fair amount of admin stuff to do as with any new batch. For first 4 weeks it's the BMT phase; you learn basic things like marching, drills, weapon handling etc. A few boring talks, and a bit of PT/swimming in between. If I am not mistaken, PES C have a 2D1N field camp. No route march/SOC/IPPT. The next 4 weeks is vocational training where you will have lessons relevant to your vocation. The small amount of physical activity remains. You may or may not move to a different camp for this. Last week, back to school 5 to prepare for parade.Cookhouse is edible but kinda meh. Every meal has chicken. It is sometimes a bit dry, sometimes ok. Pork is served but much more occasional, same goes for fish/prawn. I've had noodles only once: just about every meal has rice. I don't speak for breakfast as I am excused from staying in. Selection of vegetables is poor imo, partly because few are to my liking.Source: PES E1 enlisted in January"
I am excused from staying inWhat time do you book in/book out
"Sign in 730am, out at 630pm typically. First few days were much later due to admin stuff to settle."
Nice chicken cutlet at the canteen
"Is the ""canteen"" the same style as tekong where you only have 15 minutes to eat?"
You probably won't get to go to the canteen until you up rank or you have some awfully good sergeant or OC.
Ahh I see... thats why I never hear about any canteens within BMTCs then. I was actually quite shocked when he brought it up actually
Actually BMTC got canteen hehe the nasi lemak stall there not bad (makan there as recruit a few times)
"canteen and cookhouse are diff. canteen you pay money to buy food, cookhouse you scan 11b to get food"
Ahh I see... is the cookhouse food there at least slightly decent?
"Uhm.... I haven't tried the cookhouse before which is located near the medical center and running track. But If your cookhouse is near 41SAR or 21SA, boi have I some bad news for you"
"I will check when I get in tomorrow then. May I ask if there is field camp for pes c2 in kranji? If so, where is it held?"
"Sorry, I didn't take my BMT there so I'm not very sure about it. I was in unit already when I was posted there."
Do they still make curry salmon? The curry being there to disguise the fact that the salmon is about to go rotten.
There's salmon?! :O I rmb my time was the braised chicken drumstick or something. Meat was hard and I couldn't tear it apart. Used to give it a nickname rubber chicken when they cooked that dish
Ate at the cookhouse next to the medical center/ running track once for 2 weeks. The food was surprisingly decent tbh. Better than Tekong's staple of overcooked greens and the same double drumstick cooked in 101 sauces/ pork cubes in mysterious sauces anyways.
Personally I find it pretty bad tho compared to Tekong's muslim food. Sometimes the rice is undercooked and they like to make your plate overflow with gravy. The meat is quite bland too sometimes.
Eh bro. Come find me at kranji medical center . I'm Jonathan. Make friends with me and you might have a express queue when report sicks* wink wink*
Well im a new recruit that will be reporting to the centre tomorrow for a review so i'd be seeing you i hope

Hey Im going in at exactly the same time as you are!
"Not very sure about Kranji Camp 2's cookhouse food, but chances are you will not get to go to the canteen at all. Recruits and cadets don't get to visit canteens unless you have a really really nice sergeant/officer.I was PES C as well but my BMT was in Tekong. Your life will be relatively easy as compared to your PES A & B buddies.Your field camp will be a 2D1N event, tbh that's more of a field trip. You won't need to dig shellscrapes and there won't be any route march. No IPPT, no intensive physical training, pretty few outfields and your water parades are more frequent. It wouldn't be fair to say that I 'slogged' through my BMT, because it wasn't intensive at all. I've seen my some of my bunkmates sleep all day in bunk, skipping all activities because of various medical excuses such as panic attacks, severe asthma & allergies. Yes it can be very disheartening to have a bunk strength of 5 people during an activity because everyone else is excused this, excused that. I suggest you don't chao keng; participate in all of the exercises with your buddies. Honestly, unless you really can't, those are the times where you make true friends and most importantly, you shape your character to become a better man. It's always about the journey and never only about the destination.PES C BMT covers the very basic stuff like live firing, grenade throwing and physical training, which consists of a slow jog, some stretching exercises, some statics and some sports. I'm not sure about you, but I spent only 4 weeks on Tekong, so they crammed most of the 'high-key' activities together and the days became quite packed. Maybe it's different for you. (After which the other 5 weeks were spent on vocational training, so there weren't anymore fire movements, outfields etc etc)When you POP, it will be probably in Kranji camp and not in Marina Bay or Padang or whatever.Your available vocations are: Storeman, Driver, Medic, Air Force Tech, Ammunition, Admin Support and there are more but fk I can't seem to remember. The highest rank you can attain after BMTV is Third Sergeant.TLDR; your life will be easy. It won't really feel like military training. However, it is enough to help you understand not to take things for granted. Enjoy your BMT and good luck in the army! Serve safe, don't get into unnecessary trouble, just do as you're told and you'll POP/ORD soon enough.P.S Maybe times have changed, but this was what I experienced when I served from 2016-2018. :)"

"Trying to book lodging for 8 people for a week long trip.I've heard Airbnb is illegal, but this is probably our best overall option for what we want in living conditions. Hotels are too expensive.Are there any good hostel recommendations? Particular in the Clarke Quay area?"
"A decent hostel would be Five Stones Hostel, however it not in the Clarke Quay area but in Bugis. There's one called Beds and Dreams Inn located in Clarke Quay. I'm guessing you're interested in the night life a Clarke Quay? Take note that since you're on a budget, alcohol is quite expensive here. Bars can charge upwards of S$10 for a pint of beer. In my opinion the night life in Haji Lane(nearby bugis) is better than Clarke Quay. So if nightlife is what you're looking to be near to, you'd probably want to get a hostel near Bugis like Five Stones.You could also try book a hotel/hostel that is further away from the city centre to better fit your budget. Our country is really tiny and public transport is excellent compared to other countries.(although we Singaporeans aren't happy with it). You can get around really quickly with it."
"Hmm I'll check out Bugis.Is Airbnb okay took book, especially with 8?I'm trying to shift my group to a hostel, but it's looking like a losing battle"
"You can try Airbnb but at your own risk. The law here is that private apartments can only be leased out for a minimum duration of 3 months. This is to help with Singapore's lack of space and dense population. Which makes Airbnb illegal. If anything goes wrong you may well end up with no accommodation. However many citizens are reporting that enforcement of this law is weak. Still, at your own risk.If your group is reluctant to stay in a hostel, you could try budget hotels like Fragrance Hotel and Hotel 81. Although they are known locally to be used for ahem sexual encounters. They are the two consistent budget hotels you have here. These hotels have several locations around the island. Rooms there go from around S$80 a night. Most likely those further away from the city centre will have cheaper prices. There is a Fragrance Hotel in the Balestier/Novena area. This isn't too close to the city so it should have lower prices. It would probably take around less than 20 minutes of travel time to get to the city from that area. Most tourist attractions are downtown. Look up the websites of Hotel 81 and Fragrance to see which location is best for you. Public transport connection is islandwide so don't worry too much about accessibility to the city.Something cheap that you can get for cheap here is food.

Happy valentine’s fellow Singaporeans and redditors (:
Anyone else like me who’s gonna be lonely on valentine’s day?
Join the meetup! There's still space. :P

"Currently in the market for a reasonably lightweight laptop, with a decent processor and a lightweight graphics card. I ain't looking for an obnoxious gaming laptop. I'm planning to use it for JC, especially for PW, Photoshop and some CCA/enthusiast-level video editing on Adobe AE and Premier Pro.I've been eyeing the Mi Notebook Air 13.3"" (2018) and the ASUS UX430N. Both boasts an i5-8250U rated at 1.6Ghz, turboing at 3ish, an MX150 2GB DDR5, a decently sized SSD and a comfy typing interface. must say the prices are pretty affordable, considering the overpriced laptop market in SG. They cost around 1k, which was the budget set by my parents. I have considered gaming laptops, but they're really obnoxious and extremely bulky, though, I do love the desktop-level of power stemming from the full-sized graphics cards and better cooling.Are there any other recommendations for similar spec. laptops?Do note that I have a family desktop at home, but I do require a portable solution for CCA and PW."
"I'd go for the Asus, it's better optimised with a bigger battery. The Mi will do about 6 hours in normal use, the Asus 8."
"ThinkPad ,has Student discount onlineWorth it!"
XPS 13
I'd like to know where you can find one for ~1k.
"Normal price is at least 2k++, but there are refurbished sets going for 1.5k ish. But most people wouldn't want them as to them refurbished means old and spoilt, or price is too good to be true so becomes a scam. Older xps models might still have leftover stock inside actual brick and mortar stalls, which could possibly be cheaper too. I suggested xps13 because of its general performance and build quality, unless op really has a strict budget of 1k then it's a bad suggestion"
"It seems to be about <1.5k, which is the price of the Asus. XPS 13s usually go at silly prices, haven't even seen refurbs. Where did you see them at 1.5kish?"
"Will not go into specific stores just in case u think im a scammer. There are some on lazada, shopee. newegg has an older xps13 shipped from the states for 1.3 excluding shipping. Refurbs are common for dell laptops."
"Hmm, ok. Haven't looked hard enough. Thanks for the mentions!"
Hp Spectre
Would love to know what other Reddiporeans recommend too!
The Frozen II teaser trailer is exactly what a teaser should be. It actually looks pretty good this time round.This makes up for Will Smith as a genie.
"Oh wow, you're right. Dang, this looks like a superhero movie teaser."
Epic crossover. She is the daughter of this guy https://imgur.com/a/TgzUfJv
I don’t get it HAHAHA
The teaser trailer for the live action Aladdin has this which frankly looks quite terribly. Coupled with the fact that the trailer itself doesn't exactly impress. Both are owned by Disney so at least they're doing one thing right.

"for me it is not just I dont have the time to,its also i find myself too incompatible that dating a girl seems like an act of selfishness."
Same thoughts as me. I don't want a girl to suffer with a useless guy like me.Going to improve on myself first before consider dating a girl.

"Wow I watched quite a lot of Hotel Hell and Kitchen Nightmare episodes on youtube, but never came across this in my recommendation."
"How in the world? That's like, the one episode that went viral and was talked about in the news even. xD YouTube algorithms fail!"
I finished watching it. XD
HAHA I KNEW it was gonna be Amy's bakimg company even before i clicked on it..damnnn..it's so ridiculous that sometimes i wonder if it was all staged..
"Well, I did say legendary. :P I didn't even know there was a USA version of Kitchen Nightmares until this episode went viral."
I prefer the UK version tho. The owners seem more receptive to suggestions and change than their USA counterparts
"Oh yea, I started with that. Having Gordon voice it with his thought processes and impressions made a big difference. The presentation was more factual and less dramatic."
Some look staged tho.
"I don't know if its just my bad luck or something, went through 2nd interview and I did really well which I think I did. After 2 weeks, they sent in the typical generated rejected email. I found out from someone inside the company from another department that they hired someone else who has the skill which wasn't even listed on the qualifications list and that person has no working experiences. The most frustrating thing is that I have that skill set too but I didn't show it in my portfolio cause didn't think it was good enough and it wasn't really relevant to the job scope but the interviewer did asked if I knew the software, told him that I know the program itself and even had a diploma related to it. Well, there might be other hidden reasons.I am just gonna try it again in a year or so but won't it be awkward to meet the same interviewer again?"
It's always hard to figure out the exact reason why. All you can do is to evaluate your own performance and see where you can improve in. All the best for your job search!
Just try apply to another company.
You mean interviewer? And there are probably other factors that influence the decision like the difference in pay and traits.
Why do u all like to chew and talk with ur mouth open? Fuckin gross.
If you need to talk with your friends I think it's cool. In certain situations eating becomes a social activity.I'm more irritated by people who chew with their mouths open for no reason.

Lucked it out due to privileged birth, marriage and screwed a competent Scotman for political gains.Farquhar was the first saikang in Singapore history."
"Yeah, it's just that the exhibition was too hesitant to make that stand. The marketing for the exhibition was so sensational compared to the actual exhibition."
I know most historians know it but when you try to market an exhibition that questions his reputation and then don't even deliver an iota of it then it's a shit exhibition
LOL that comparison tho
Farquhar was the first saikang in Singapore history.Best history lesson ever.
"Actually what did Raffles do to the natives? Reading the article the most I can glimpse is that he was ignorant of some local traditions, which isn't surprising since he's no anthropologist."
I went to the exhibition and please do not waste your money.It didn't set out to do what it claims to doIt basically ignored and whitewash the shit Raffles did to the Malays
"I also found it underwhelming. There was a conspicuous absence of SG related stories/materials, given the whole bicentennial thing. His Javanese collection was mildly interesting."
Exactly! I was looking for more SG stories and it was missing. The write ups were so passive and bland.
Eh cause he didn't do much for Singapore so there aren't that much stories.The exhibition should have been re-titled: Raffles - The Imperialists and Imperial Knowledge
Hahaha true
"But it is so edgy! We are shit talking the founder of Singapore!Kennie Ting, Director of ACM, said the museum is “very committed to doing exhibitions that are unprecedented, in terms of the kinds of new perspectives and knowledge we are able to contribute to Singapore and the world”. If that means ruffling a few feathers, we’ll take it.Whose feathers will actually be ruffled here."
blah BS
basically raffles came to singapore and said he wants to name it singapore and let william fker to be in charge and left. so whats so good about this guy lmao
"He knows how to hire the right people for the job, something the PAP does as well."
If they did we wouldn't have had the MRT breakdown fiasco.
oof
New naratif have a podcast on the bicentennial celebration which covers the effects of colonisation on the indigenous population. Can listen via their website or Spotify. Well worth a listen!
Funny how the BBC sought them out to discuss the Bicentennial while PJ Thum is now a total pariah of the MSM here
"Thum and new naratif actually have some pretty legit coverage of asean, which includes investigative journalism and think pieces. Their little outfit might actually give better SEA insight compared to the msm which has a more international or global focus.I think it makes perfect sense for the BBC to approach them, honestly."

You’re joking. Ideological opinion pieces aren’t news.
Ha. Tell that to the numerous institutions and schools and companies that use his name to make it big.
"Hi r/singapore, my focus this week will be on the monitor lizards of Singapore.There are numerous species of monitor lizards, with about 80 species described so far, found in Africa, the Middle East, tropical Asia, Australasia, and all the way to the Solomon Islands and several other island groups in the western Pacific. They come in a wide range of sizes, from small Australian species less than 30 centimetres long, to the Komodo Dragon, the world's largest living lizard at 3 metres. Monitors live in all sorts of habitats, from deserts to mangrove swamps, from forests to grasslands. You’ve got species that spend most of their time in the trees, and others that live almost exclusively on the ground. And while virtually all species are carnivores, there are 3 species of monitors in the Philippines that feed heavily on fruits.Singapore has 3 species of monitor lizard: the Malayan Water Monitor is the most common and widespread, the Clouded Monitor has a more restricted distribution but can be easily spotted in forest habitats, as well as a number of our parks and gardens, while Dumeril's Monitor was rediscovered fairly recently in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve.I’ll share more about each of the 3 species of monitor lizards in the comments, but feel free to ask any questions you might have about monitor lizards, and I'll try to answer them to the best of my ability. You can also share your own stories and anecdotes, or suggest other animals for me to cover in future.Previous edition: Wild Boar"
"Malayan Water MonitorAs mentioned, this is the most common and widespread species of monitor lizard in Singapore.This species can reach a huge size; there is a record from 1932 of an individual that reached 3.21 metres in length - that's even longer than most Komodo Dragons! However, this is an exceptional record, and most individuals don't seem to exceed 2 to 2.5 metres in length, still pretty large. The Water Monitor is one of several contenders for the world's second largest living lizard.As its name suggests, the Water Monitor loves water, and the main habitat requirement seems to be the presence of a body of water. So in Singapore, you'll see Water Monitors patrolling our canals and drains, swimming in our reservoirs and rivers, or foraging along ponds and lakes. In forest habitats, they prefer swampy areas and streams. Water Monitors also live in mangroves and other coastal habitats, and can be seen patrolling the beaches. Being strong swimmer, Water Monitors are also found on many of our offshore islands. In fact, large monitor lizards swimming in the water are often misidentified as crocodiles. Like a crocodile, the Water Monitor uses its long and powerful tail to propel itself. Water Monitors are such great swimmers that apparently, after the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia wiped out all life on the island, Water Monitors were among the very first terrestrial vertebrates to recolonise the area, by swimming across from other neighbouring islands at least 12 kilometres away!The species is so widespread here that it's difficult to list all the places where it can be found, but perhaps the one place where the Water Monitor is easiest to spot is Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. Other places include Pasir Ris Park, Jurong Lake, Pulau Ubin, the edges of most of our reservoirs and rivers, and around the various lakes and ponds in the Botanic Gardens. Malayan Water Monitors can be seen quite easily in Sentosa, and one even nearly became roadkill during one of the practice rounds of the Singapore Grand Prix in 2016.Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, you'll often see Water Monitors hanging around resorts, in mangroves, along beaches and riverbanks, or surviving in canals in the heart of the city. Lumpini Park in Bangkok is famous for its thriving population of Water Monitors.It's a versatile and adaptable species. Although semiaquatic, it is also skilled at climbing trees; juveniles will hide in tree holes to evade terrestrial predators, while large adults will readily climb trees to bask in the sun.The Water Monitor eats a wide variety of prey, from large invertebrates such as snails, centipedes, and crabs to fishes, frogs, smaller reptiles, to mammals and birds. Needless to say, the larger the individual, the bigger the potential prey. They will not hesitate to go for toads or venomous snakes, and have even been seen swallowing turtles whole.One important source of food is carrion, and the scavenging activities of monitor lizards play an important role in nutrient recycling. Elsewhere in the region, Water Monitors living close to human settlements depend heavily on leftovers and scraps (which is why they often hang around rubbish dumps), and may be seen as pests due to their habit of snatching poultry.Monitor lizards, like snakes, swallow their food whole. Their flexible jaws enable them to widen their gape and consume large items. If prey is too large, the lizard uses its powerful forelimbs to pin down its food while ripping off strips of meat with its sharp teeth.Water Monitors also love eggs of all sorts, and will raid bird nests (apparently this is why the swans in the Botanic Gardens keep laying eggs but they never manage to hatch), and are known to dig up the nests of sea turtles and crocodiles.Juveniles are a lot more colourful than adults, and large adults often bear scars on their backs, the result of fights that break out between males as they compete for females. Rival males will rear up on their hind legs and wrestle in a contest of strength; whoever manages to overpower and pin his rival down wins."
"Water Monitors are such great swimmers that apparently, after the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia wiped out all life on the island, Water Monitors were among the very first terrestrial vertebrates to recolonise the area, by swimming across from other neighbouring islands at least 12 kilometres away!Why would a water monitor - or any other animal for that matter - swim so far? Would it have sensed or seen food for 12km away?"
"#wanderlustBut in all seriousness, random dispersal events were the most likely reason. A monitor was feeling adventurous, went for a dip, and started swimming, with competition from rivals likely to be a push factor. For young adults, which are being displaced from prime areas, they might decide to swim between islands in search of a new place to settle down. And while at sea, if the monitor had managed to sense that land or a food source wasn't too far away, it might have decided to just keep swimming. It's also possible that a monitor might have been swept further out to sea by bad weather, or hitched a ride on mats of floating vegetation or fallen trees, eventually making landfall far, far away. It also helps that many reptiles are known to be able to survive for long periods without food.Sure, maybe some of these monitors got exhausted and drowned, or were eaten by sharks. But with enough individuals making the journey and surviving, it doesn't take long to establish a breeding population once again."
Saw a big one of these during CNY at Bishan Park. About 2M long. Largest I have seen in a while.
"Juveniles are a lot more colourful than adults, and large adults often bear scars on their backs, the result of fights that break out between males as they compete for females. Rival males will rear up on their hind legs and wrestle in a contest of strength; whoever manages to overpower and pin his rival down wins.Here was the recent fight captured in Singapore :)"
"Yo man, just curious on what you do for a living. Is it related to animals in Singapore?"
should have a side link for 'local animals' and link all the threadssometimes missed out on 1 or 2 editions must find
"I used to list every edition, but that triggered the spam filter, so I've structured it such that every new edition links to the previous one, so you can go all the way back to the very first one I did."
Maybe try putting this link in your post instead.
Are you encyclopedia.
And then got run across F1 track also.
"""Face to face with Godzilla""I'm so glad it made it across safely."
"Wah the Malayan water monitor chomping on that red eared terrapin 😢😢I mean yeah circle of life, the lizard needs to eat etc. but meh terrapins were my childhood pet lo. 😣Anyway thanks! Informative as always"
"What should you do when you see one that's 2m? Got my balls stuck up my throat when I was jogging alone along a park connector. Nearest human help was probably 200m away.Luckily, it ran into the canal, while I just turn back and sprinted for my dear life"
"I think just don't approach in an aggressive manner and you'll be fine. The ones here are quite used to human presence and to the best of my knowledge pose no danger unless provoked. They're really more likely to run, like the one you met."
"It's usually alright to just walk past. Most monitor lizards, even the large ones, prefer to run away. They're only dangerous if cornered or harassed. Stay away if the monitor lizard starts standing up and puffing its body, making itself look bigger and taller. You'll also often hear a loud hissing, while the tail is raised. Here's an example of the defensive posture seen in many monitor lizard species, but this is rarely seen when they encounter humans out in the open, where they can easily flee."
"I have seen monitor lizards all my life when 3 conditions are - quiet , not built-up and when I stop and look around. I get the impression that they are actually everywhere and they blend easily with the background. I have never seen one near any rubbish dump or where there is concrete. I always wondered where they find food looking at their size."
"Clouded MonitorLess widespread than the Malayan Water Monitor, the Clouded Monitor prefers forests and wooded areas. Although both species do live alongside each other in many locations, they have different habitat preferences, with the Water Monitor being found close to water, and the Clouded Monitor preferring inland areas.How do you tell the 2 species apart? The most straightforward way is to look at the head. The Water Monitor has a long and slender snout, almost crocodilian in profile, and its nostrils are placed close to the tip of the snout. Whereas the Clouded Monitor has a shorter snout, and its head is more triangular or wedge-shaped. Its nostrils are located midway between the eyes and the tip of the snout. This species does not grow as large as the Water Monitor, with the largest individuals reaching 1.5 metres in length.In Singapore, the Clouded Monitor can be easily seen basking along trails in and around the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Central Catchment Nature Reserve, along the Rail Corridor in the Bukit Timah area, as well as Bukit Batok Nature Park. In recent years, the species has spread to the Botanic Gardens and become established there. Pulau Ubin is another place where you can spot Clouded Monitors. There are also sightings from Sungei Buloh and Punggol.The Clouded Monitor fees heavily on terrestrial invertebrates; the bulk of its diet is made up of earthworms, snails, and large insects such as grasshoppers and beetles, although it will also prey on frogs and smaller lizards. Unlike the Water Monitor, carrion does not seem to be an important part of the Clouded Monitor's diet.Much of this food is found by digging in soil and leaf litter, and the loud rustling as it moves through the undergrowth is how people often first notice the presence of a Clouded Monitor while hiking along trails in the forest. They are also very good climbers, and can be seen basking on tree trunks, or hiding in large cavities in tree trunks."
Do bullet ants next!
What are the main predators of adult monitors? Will large raptors be able to take down small individuals? Or crocodiles with larger ones?
"In Sungei Buloh, Estuarine Crocodiles will readily prey on Malayan Water Monitors. In the past, when crocodiles were almost never seen, the monitor lizards were the top predator of the wetlands. But with the return of the crocodiles, they now have to contend with the true king.Large raptors like the White-bellied Sea Eagle and Changeable Hawk-eagle can certainly go after monitor lizards.Several years back, a Reticulated Python in Sungei Buloh was found after it had swallowed a large prey item. When it got disturbed by all the attention from humans, it regurgitated a whole adult Malayan Water Monitor and tried to slither off.There's also a record of a Smooth-coated Otter killing a Malayan Water Monitor in Malaysia, although it's not known if this was a true act of predation, as there's no mention of the otter consuming the monitor lizard's flesh after it had been killed. There's also mention of Asian Small-clawed Otter families killing the Malayan Water Monitors that shared their exhibit in the Singapore Zoo, although those instances might have been motivated by the otters having pups, rather than predation.And unfortunately, dogs, both pets and strays, can be a serious problem for monitor lizards. Packs of feral dogs will maul Malayan Water Monitors, although sometimes they just leave the bodies after apparently killing the lizards."
Humans....Makes for a great curry. Tastes like chicken
"Can you help me ID this monitor lizard?http://imgur.com/gallery/PfWUdYESaw it on Saturday, MacRitchie. Markings look very distinctive."
Pretty sure it’s a Malayan water monitor
"I'm quite sure too. If you're up close, the malayan monitor can be distinguished from the clouded monitor by the location of their nostrils. The malayan has nostrils on the edge of their snout whereas the clouded has nostrils about midway up its snout."
"Malayan Water Monitor. You'll find the other common species, the Clouded Monitor, in the same area, but that one is more terrestrial and usually isn't in the forest rather than close to the water."
"Hey man came across this thread by sheer luck, spotted this a week ago along the kallang river. Can you ID it? Was wondering if she is expecting? ( http://imgur.com/gallery/JZLnrNz)"
"Another Malayan Water Monitor. I can't tell whether it's gravid (usually only obvious if you have a pair in captivity that has just mated, and the female's abdomen starts to grow), but it's also possible that it simply had a heavy meal."
Thank you for the info!
"If I am not wrong, their population, locally at least, used to be under control as they were a cheap / free source of protein. I learnt that monitor lizards were frequently hunted for their meat."
"Yeah, I was told that at least up until the 1980s, you could find live monitor lizards trussed up for sale in the wet markets. These days I'm sure foreign workers still try to catch monitor lizards, although they're technically protected wildlife."
"to the Komodo Dragon,I see you finally made a post about your relatives!Edit: and could I suggest a post about colugos! I recently saw one and got really excited about it."
They're like everywhere! MacRitchie. Botanic Gardens. Tampines Eco Park. Sungei Buloh. Pulau Ubin. ST John's Island. Just some of the places I've seen them at.
"The first wild monitor lizard I saw was flattened along Rifle Range Road when I was doing a navex.Spotted a few at Pasir Ris Park which seemed normal, but the most random one was at a HDB in Telok Blangah and another at Serangoon Secondary when I was camping there!They seemed kinda cute tbh, just sitting there being nua and not giving anyone trouble."
I have seen some lizards which are roughly 15cm long and quite skinny but not like those household lizards. More like a miniature monitor lizard. I usually find them in bushes at urban areas. Are they also part of the monitor lizard family?
Possibly the Many-lined Sun Skink? Or the more common Changeable Lizard?
I think those are changeable lizards. Another imported species.
There was one at the old Bidadari cemetery
"Who monitors the monitor?Jokes aside, does the name of this reptile really come from its act of ""monitoring"" their surroundings?"
"Since their related to the Komodo Dragon, are their bites dangerous to humans?I often heard in school, avoid chasing or standing behind a monitor lizard as their tail can cause serious injuries to humans, is there any true in this?"
"Komodo Dragons are the only monitor lizard species that will actively prey on humans (simply because they're so large), but the smaller monitors can still do a lot of damage with a defensive bite. After all, they're predators, and are armed with lots of sharp, curved teeth that are meant for grabbing prey. Here's a skull of a Malayan Water Monitor. So even a nip from a monitor lizard can be quite nasty (GRAPHIC).Also, given that monitor lizards do a lot of scavenging, they have a lot of bacteria in their mouths, so a bite does run a risk of becoming infected. In the past, Komodo Dragons were thought to have used bacteria to kill their prey. So even if the prey animal managed to escape, the wound would fester and become septic, eventually weakening and killing the victim, whereupon the Komodo Dragon would track it down and feast. However, this is now no longer thought to be the case; Komodo Dragons (and several other monitor lizard species) are instead known to produce venom that can cause various symptoms such as pain, dizziness, increased bleeding, muscle soreness, breathlessness, and lowered blood pressure (among others) in humans. Although not as fast-acting and as lethal as the venoms produced by say, cobras or vipers, these venoms are thought to play an important role in incapacitating prey, and may even have biomedical applications. I don't know if the species found in Southeast Asia have been examined for the presence of venom and venom glands, but I wouldn't be surprised if they do.As for the tail, it is certainly a powerful weapon that is a monitor lizard's first line of defense. It can give a painful whack to any animal that gets too close, but for a human being, getting whipped by the tail is probably not as dangerous as getting bitten.And of course, if you are trying to catch a monitor lizard and have somehow escaped getting bitten or hit by the tail, you might still get injured. Just look at the claws in this photo - they're great for climbing trees and digging holes, but can also serve as defensive weapons."

I saw a handbag made from monitor leather.How viable is farming the monitor lizard?
"Farming monitor lizards is theoretically possible, but it does depend a lot on the costs involved. There are captive breeding facilities for various monitor lizard species to supply the trade in exotic pets, but I think there's still a significant proportion in the pet trade that are wild-caught, or simply come from eggs laid in captivity by wild-caught females that happened to be gravid.The trade in monitor lizard leather focuses on a few widespread and abundant African and Asian species, including the Malayan Water Monitor. Apparently most of the supply in Malayan Water Monitor skins is from wild-caught lizards harvested in Indonesia, and is shipped through Singapore to international markets. While farming could mean that supply and quality of the leather is consistent, paying hunters to collect monitor lizards from the wild is likely going to be a lot cheaper.The farming of crocodiles and alligators was motivated largely by declining populations due to overhunting and habitat loss, so unless populations of the targeted monitor lizard species start to crash, most of the people involved in the trade probably aren't going to see much economic benefit in establishing a farm. But that might change - Kering – the company behind big brands including Gucci, Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen – is said to have established a python farm in Thailand to supply snake leather, so it is possible that a big brand might eventually invest in a similar endeavour for monitor lizards."
"I was wondering about the smaller garden lizards hanging out in the parks. They kinda look like skinny, less colourful bearded dragons. There are quite a few of them in the park right behind my house and I love to spot them among the bushes. Could you do one about them too?"
"Sure! Those are Changeable Lizards, and I'll feature them in an upcoming edition."
My class monitor looks like a lizard.
"I live in the north, and I have been hearing distant sound of fireworks for the past 30 minutes?I can't really see any fireworks where I am, so I reckon it must be from somewhere quite far. Any idea who is letting off the fireworks? Seems like a strange day to do it (not exactly a 'special day' on CNY today).Just feeling curious. My cats are quite unsettled by the sound, cos it was quite loud just now. I still can hear some distant popping, even now."
"I can confirm, my mom heard it too. Staying in Yishun as well."
Same here
"I think it’s the popping of sugar cane that the Chinese are burning, to bai Tian Kong."
"Wow, does burning sugar cane cause such popping sounds?Must be really loud where they are, cos even from so far, it still sounds quite loud. Though it has tapered off somewhat."
"Might be in Johor, since y'all up in the North. I don't hear anything in the Westedit: BUT THE FUCKING BURNING SMELL DOE smh really fucking me up bad"
"13 Feb midnight is the start is CNY day 9, which traditionally, is when you pray to the ""Sky God"" idk the english name.used to be a big deal. Temples will hold feasts and fireworks. My grandma used to cook a whole pig, a whole duck and a whole chicken and other assorted dishes. Basically lunch and dinner for the week and more.Edit: I was wrong. is still a big deal. see below ↓"
Actually it’s still a big deal... the biggest deal of the year for a Taoist/Chinese folk religion.“Sky God” is also known as the Jade Emperor in English. He is considered the biggest/highest god in the Chinese folk religion echelon
"ah, yu huang da di izzit? no wonder my grandma cooked a bigger feast than when it was my grandpa's birthday."
"Haha yup that’s him. Also can I make a wild guess, is your family hokkien by any chance?"
"dad side teochew, mom side hokkien so idk what am I lol.No one is particularly devout anyway. urself leh?"
"I ask because usually on this day, it is the hokkien who have the most elaborate prayer set ups. They can arrange an altar one to two stories high, complete with sugar cane, suckling pig and lots of wonderful food"
I smell haze
"The haze smell has been on and off for the past few days liao.Though, now that someone mentions popping of sugar cane, there really seem to be a smell of caramel in the air. Not sure if I am imagining it."
"I smelled it for at least few weeks, sometimes very faint but 2 nights ago and tonight it smells very strong suddenly."
Is it only people in the north? I think I saw some CNA report that it was from the JB side. I remember getting a very strong whiff of the haze on 2nd night of CNY.
"Tonight should be bai tian gong smell and noise. I think the popping sounds are from the sugar cane. Other festivals didn't use sugar can and didn't hear this.Edmw got ppl bai, can go and ask them."
"Currently in the North, the burning smell is damn strong and my friends in NE also can smell it."
"Haze has been noticeable last few nights in the east too, setting off my allergies. Sian af"
"Wtf, I still hear it and I live in the Seletar area. Probably being invaded by Malaysia. All the best guys."
"Okay, the people in the North, the Woodlands, Sembawang and Yishun-ite will take position and prepare to defend. Rest of you, all sleep tight.Hmm... seems like all the popping stop liao. Finally."
Yea it finally stopped 😂
"Damn it, start again.Northern peeps, take cover lah."
Jhor bauru CNY celebrations
Burning sugar canes mate
"The popping sounds are still going. Sounds really 'solid' pops.Stopped for a while, but now it seems to be back again. Quick popping. Wondering what time they will stop?"
"Yup it’s fireworks, could see them popping all around JB. Source: Top view of house"
Nice. But any idea what is the occasion? The praying to Tian Gong? The sound went on for more than 1 hour. I think the last pop I heard was about 1:50am?
I think the most plausible reason would be praying to Tian Gong since it’s mostly done by Hokkiens.. and well most chinese i think 9 out of 10 are all that Was hoping for a huge tian gong to appear in the sky though but it’s just noise :(
I live on the edge of Singapore at Admiralty Link. I can see Malaysia from my home! I don't see any fireworks or light-up. It sounds oddly like someone firing blanks from a SAR21.
Burning of sugar cane
"According to another redditor here, it is fireworks. And there are videos on FB that had fireworks along the coast/beach area of JB."
I heard it too at around 1:30 am
"Sorry, it's my pigu on fire."
"Yeah, when my friend showed me this we both thought of the same thing.""Why did he/she take a photo of her""She's not bothering anyone and it's kind of creepy to be taking photos of other's because of the clothes they are wearing (unless it's a costume). Might be very exposing? Yes, so don't show everyone dummy. Like if you are so bothered by it why need to post it online, for awareness???"
"To the best of my knowledge the original post was taken and posted with the caption which suggests that the guy withdrawing money was to pay the woman and “we” know why, which is suggesting she is a prostitute. So it wasn’t purely because of her clothes but rather the scene of a guy withdrawing money for a scantily dressed woman, which is a common sight in Thailand. That being said, I do not agree that the photo should be taken and posted."
Like that also tio complaint... Like the cosplay underboobs thing.
Fuck Wan bao and fuck the netizen who posted it to shame her.
they are jealous of her nehnehpok
what a low blow these people took.Disappointing.
Why is she apologizing though? Shouldn’t the men be the creep here?
Thank you mods for moderating previous posts on this poor girl.
What happened in those posts? Mind sharing?
Women dress however they want to.Just like some of us men who roam/jog around without shirts on.This is seriously quite fucked up
Singapore is a cosmopolitan city.Are we going to criticise everyone who is NOT up to our personal standards?Will this happen if she is an Ang Moh lady?
Most people aren't complaining... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"Yeah, but some comments were downright nasty."
Cos some people are holy sinless saints
Moral indignation is jealousy with a halo
"Well, I ain’t complaining too. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
wan hao and stomp are the scum of Singapore
"meh, worst I HV seen is big gal wear saf admin as dress..."
Pretty common
Not complaining
Id like to see the photos
"google for:skimpy outfitqueueingATMSomerset MRTIt's on stomp, edmw, and other various sites."

"Lol, inviting challenge while knowing no one would take it up."
Really shameless. Machiam 'Come and sue me lah! You dare?'. Knowing they will have to be outed as HIV positive and will probably lose.
You can do file tort case where plaintiffs are not identified.I think he's just stating the facts plainly. Why read so negatively into what people are saying?
I actually find the ministers comments quite amusing.does the minister know how data works ? is he too old to be aware of how storage technology works?when did doctors become security experts deciding that there was no further threat?does anyone advising the minister be it in MOH or SPF know how storage technology works!?!?!?!?!?yes the police may have confiscated ALL that they could find but given how technology works (anyone heard of copy and paste? what about WhatsApp? or perhaps screen shot?) it wouldn't be a surprise that any leaked information once leaked is forever available.appalling. just simply appalling. I can't decide if this statement is made as an excuse for the truth or if it is highlighting severe lack of knowledge.
The head of technology in japan don’t even know how to use a computer. I wouldnt be surprise if the lack of basically technology knowledge is lacking
"Just a clarification that MOH is not equal to doctors. They don’t represent the collective consensus of doctors and neither are they made up entirely of them. That being said, I think it was relevant to ask the HIV experts of their opinion since they treat HIV patients on a daily basis and are considered to be their strongest advocates in Singapore. Of course, that’s not mutually exclusive from asking ‘data experts.’"
if you read the CNA report it specifically states that he consulted medical professionals who insisted care and well being of patients are most important.who are they to judge care and well being when it comes to technological risk. which is why if you take the time to read my full post I split doctors and MOH/SPF into two separate groups. since presumably MOH has a technical support and security team too.
Seems like whoever did the digital forensics for SPF's investigation either didn't do a good job or their caveats were brushed off by higher ups. Either way doesn't look good.
ice may have confiscated ALL that they could find but given how technology works (anyone heard of copy and paste? what about WhatsApp? or perhaps screen shot?) it wouldn't be a surprise that any leaked information once leaked is forever available.appalling. just simply appalling. I can't decide if this statement is made as an exI'm more amused how U managed to draw up so many pts on technology when the article has nothing to do with any of itTo answer thatprobably notthe doctors don't decide. It's most likely decided by the IS forensic teamPretty sure someone in the IS team knows how storage technology work
"you are judging my response based on your lack of knowledge, please listen to the entire ministerial statement. while the issue of healthcare is addressed, i quote from STAfter an ""extensive"" search of Brochez's residence, computers, storage devices and e-mail account, the police seized or deleted all relevant information that had been found.The police also found that Brochez had sent a further 46 records to his mother by e-mail. She agreed to let the police access her e-mail account and delete the records.Mr Gan said the police search was extensive and all relevant material found had been seized or deleted.""While there could be no guarantee, MOH had good reason to believe that the information had been secured and the risk of future exposure significantly mitigated."""
"First point, like I said the article has nothing to do with the technical aspect of the case, the fact that you need to write from ST instead is telling2, you asked questions I answered them accordingly. I've worked with the police before in similar cases. I answered your question based on what I've seenIn the even where data leaked is discovered, the internal IT team will start tracing where it could have gone. In most cases companies do not have the know-how and will engage outside help(question 2)Question 3,you asked if they know how storage technology works, like I said earlier, I've worked with their people before, I can assure you they have people who knows how storage technology works. When the case is things is so serious, they usually get relevant experts in to check"
"PDPA governs the collection, use and dissemination of personal data by private organisations.I've read the whole content of the pdpa once due to the nature of my work, and I always chuckle when ppl try to scare others by anyhow quoting pdpa, especially on fb. lol"
Care to summarise the extend of pdpa's coverage?
Bless you
Elaborate?
"After seeing so many comments on this, there are some things pple really need to know about the caseThis is a very high profile case. MoH and the police usually don't leave anything to chance for these type of cases. More likely than not they will get industry expert from private sector working on this case. We're not talking some interns or entry level pple doing this, they pay good money to get industry leaders involved.There is very little that MoH could have done to prevent the data getting stolen. The only thing they could have done is to ensure the implementation of RMS systems. This systems ensures that only the authorized pple can have access to those data. However in this case, the person access the data was authorized. RMS can also prevent screenshots of data document to be taken which might have helped in this case but if that person was really determined to get the data out he could easily take photos of the data with his phone. Reason why camera phones are banned in the SAF. Even than I would be able to get the data out using primitive solutions like pen and paperThat being said, there are a few things that MoH could have done better. One a USB storage device was involved. USB storage should only be allowed for private use. All organization needs to ban USB devices. There is no reason for their existent in any entity, they can transfer files via file share/shared storage device. 2ndly the could have ensured sensitive data is not allowed to be brought out of the organization. This however might be an operational issue. However do note that even with these in place, it would still not have prevented the data leak because like I said earlier, the person is authorized to access the data. The only way which could have prevented this from happening is to place the entire MoH on Mindef level of lockdown. This is not realistic for hospital environment to implement"
Thank you for bringing in reason.
So far 3 major disasters under this Health Minister. And a cover-up is definitely a “judgement call”. They spent a fortune to compensate those who died at the transplant renal ward and now offering money again.
So he's implying that there is no need for PDPA because victims can sue. Lets just scrap PDPA then since private corporations can also be sued.
"To deal with concerns that this may compromise training and prejudice commanders who push their soldiers to perform better, Mr Singh suggested that a possible exception to the law could apply only if commanders behave recklessly, maliciously or display a wilful disregard for safety considerations.For example, the immunity should not apply if a commander chooses deliberately to cancel a safety briefing or had not catered for sufficient rest before or between training activities, said Mr Singh.This does sound balanced and reasonable."
"support this too. i don't see why there can be any opposition to this - if anyone causes death or injury through serious negligence, they should not be protected."
Could it be mindef do not want to compromise confidential training materials in civil court ? Either that or they know lifting the immunity will open the flood gates and they will be spending an eternity defending left right center.
totally support
"Potential can of worms that shouldn’t be opened without a lot of careful thought. Even in the relatively litigious United States, soldiers can’t sue for service-related injuries — it’s barred by the Feres doctrine, for fear of involving the judiciary in second-guessing that could in the long run erode military discipline and effectiveness.The UK permits such lawsuits with some caveats (combat immunity still holds, and broad immunity may be revived in an emergency), but it’s not without its critics."
the US actually fights wars. big difference.
they also have real Generals
zing!
and properly paid and well respected soldiers
""
"Mindef's defence will be ""oh we already have a military court and justice process"".But of course, they won't address the question of ""if you have a military judicial process that is more stringent than civilian courts, why would you be scared of lifting legal immunity in the first place?"""

"My colleague Dennis Tan had raised this proposal in 2016 following the tragic death of PTE Dominique Sarron Lee. Minister responded by suggesting that the removal of immunity may compromise training and prejudice commanders who, for example push their soldiers to complete IPPT or strive for higher performance. To address such legitimate concerns, a possible exception to Section 14 on the grounds of training safety would only apply if a commander behaves recklessly, maliciously or displays a wilful disregard for safety considerations. For example, if a commander had deliberately chosen to cancel a safety briefing, disregarded training safety regulations, had not catered for sufficient rest before or between training and missions without adequate reason or risk mitigation approved beforehand by a more senior commander, then the blanket immunity provided under Section 14 should not apply. It would follow that a court of law should be left to determine whether MINDEF or the commander in question must be held liable.Amen"
"I support this idea. If there is a blatant disregard for human life, the immunity should be lifted.Note, this is not to say that the people involved will be convicted. But we have to be accountable towards the citizens of the country, who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for our country. And the best way to do it is by being transparent and giving the appropriate punishment to the people who did wrong.If our military is a professional military, one could argue that they signed up for it. They accepted the risk. But we are conscripts. And for every conscripted soldier, the Army should be held liable towards the parents and loved ones of said conscripted soldier."
Support this. Safety is paramount in an organisation that especially heavily relies on conscription.

"Mr Pritam Singh is also a Major in the SAF, so Mindef can't pull the old shit about civvies commenting on military matters"
What are they so afraid of that they need to be protected from a civil law suit.I also think WP should lead the way on reforms to national service.
Why the last proposal Ah Ng keep quiet ar? Scare no one want to support military is it ?
All I’m gonna say.Safety officer & VC roles going to become hot potato in my reservist liao.
So Glad I’m not a commander LOL!
"If I draw the short straw, I’m just gonna add 30 mins to every timed evaluation.Fk KPI. Fk standards. Fk your evaluation. Fail everything lor. What are they gonna do? Threaten confinement??Fk that. Not gonna throw away my life for this shit."
Yeah hahahahaha. Why should I give a fuck about unit KPI or this other shit when it doesn’t affect me? Rather stay safe and put my hard work into things that benefit me.
"They have immunities while other suffer loosing their loved ones. No wonder death rate is so high. The culprits only serve jail term for what civilian courts term it as manslaughter just because they are high ranking officers?. Even in the US, officers that are court martial face high severe punishment equal to that of civilian courts for such negligent!!!."
"I think there shouldn’t be any legal immunity for MINDEF to begin with.Minister of law Shanmugan said that ‘nobody is above the law, not even a minister’ .Source: https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/no-one-above-law-ShanmugamSo why is it that an organisation that is head by the minister of defence , immune to legal charges against them?What makes MINDEF so special that no matter what kind of charges that are being pressed against them, they are always protected by the very law that was enacted to serve the purpose of ensuring justice ?Is this what we really want to see in Singapore?"
A simple solution to lifting immunity and allowing the men to “sue” officers: drones.You could even promote this as SAF’s training for effective hi tech drone recce.../s

"Catch 22 here isn't it?The only way for WP to gain more seats in parliament is to show they are a respectable and better choice.Only way to be a better choice is by proposing sound policies that better societyBut if they propose such policies, people say ""hard to take anything WP says seriously""Then people don't vote for WP because they don't take anything they say seriouslyThen people say ""hard to take WP seriously"" because they only have 6 seatsPeople don't take WP seriously because of lack of seats > People don't vote for WP > people don't take WP seriously because of lack of seats"
"I can think of quite a few examples that do not remotely for under ""sound policies""I agree that they need to show they're ready and able to run gov, but we don't think they're inept because of their sound policies suggested."
"Tbh, I would just be happy they delivered it."
They’re trying to improve service levels you know. Give them some breathing space
"Reminds me of when Redmart delivered me one single can of soda, alone in a bag. Inside a big box."
The shipping issues with those kind of orders is actually killing our environment without us ever knowing. Imagine that redmart truck that delivered to you only carried your package and maybe 2 more. That's a ton of wasted fuel + shipping waste material.
Yeah Redmart has some weird shipping stuff going on. I had a small sachet of taco mix inside a bag inside a box and then the next week 8 cartons of drink stuffed into a box.
Had a “tap and run” incident yesterday... now i have to travel to the singpost center on a weekend for my collection

Just wondering for non-combat fit (specific PES C) how are they chosen to go Navy without signing on? Is there a factor behind the choice?
Hidden criteria. Swim from Sg to tekong to show off your water prowess.
hold your breath underwater and recite the singapore pledge w/o drowing
Majority are Chinese tbh. Other then that they check your background as navy has higher clearance levels
As long as you’re not malay then can..
"There's no particular reason. The navy and air force also require drivers, clerks and security troopers. Someone has to fulfill those roles, it's just a matter of chance. Where you end up in the Navy as non-combat may depend on your academic or English proficiency; some units get to pick the 'creme de la creme' of these personnel before the remnants get shunted to random Navy units in need of personnel."
How they know our English proficiency?
"The multi-MCQ test administered during the pre-enlistment checkup at CMPB, and (presumably) O-level results."
I see.
"The SAF has access to your academic info, including all individual subject grades at 'O' and 'A' levels."
"If your family has someone that used to work in the maritime industry, it greatly helps your chances, also good to have high security clearance. Highly doubt that performance during bmt has any influence, its more on your background. Oh and if you have a diploma in any maritime related courses, highly likely will be posted as a seaman onboard shipSource: Served onboard ship as a specialist during NS"
"The maritime diploma doesn't really help for navy, because they still have to take navy Certificate of competency even if you have civilian one. Source if from my friends who didn't get to navy, although most are Malays...... So..."
My friend posted as a navy chef. LMAO no cooking experience at all. Only knew how to cook maggi mee :’)
"OP, nobody knows how anyone gets posted to any vocation. The marpas test during pre enlistment medical is said to affect posting but we don't know how. Other than that it's all speculation and he say, she say"
Don't get sea sick.
"It’s just an assumption, but:• I think you need to have high scores cuz navy very demanding• the higher ranks will refer you to this"
"No, you people are not ""selected"". You're merely randomized and got in."
Nothing stands in our way!Hooyah!
"This one ndu leh, OP is pes c how to go?"
Nothing stands in our way!

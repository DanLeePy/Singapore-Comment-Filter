"Why don't use own mobile phone? Why give fake contact number? Obvious want to avoid being found. If already have such thoughts, must punish more severely."

"Low said that his client did not flee the scene, but simply left as he “was not aware” that it was his duty to remain behind.
Mr Low, so "" not aware"" can be an excuse for any crime?"
"only 8 month jail,consume drug,carry a knife n hit n run also not counted? victim also need daily asst.what judgement is that"
"at least he called for an ambulance. in yishun the e-scooter riders knock into you will ask if you got see them and if you did, why didn't you avoid them instead."
"More accidents will happen,as LTA is considering to give approval for 14 licencees for PMDs. E-scooters are already creating havoc in USA,but here in this tiny red dot,money matters more than lives !"
Fine him 100K and jail him for 5 years! Please enforce the escooter BAN!
sadly our gvt never review or take actions that tons of mat are convictited from taking and sellings drugs.the figures is shocking if you had a fren in there.
"Who will paid for the victim medical bills, future earnings and suffering? If justice is not seen to be done, many will be very negative against genuine responsible e-scooter drivers. Many will blame the LTA or govt for their inaction. The next time an e-scooter approach me, I will kick them first. When the laws cannot protect you, you have to protect yourself. That is Universal Law."
Cane him.
"This is what our SPF is good at nowadays - catch and punish the locals for small-scale crimes. American FT caused big HIV-data leak affecting THOUSANDS, didn't detain him, didn't jail/sentence him when got the chance, allowed him to leave SG even when he got a crime list, now cannot find him. But I supposed we should be grateful he wasn't given New Citizen-ship, hor."
"How about the victim, she lost her job and income, why the law do not protect or provide any compensation?"
"Roland Roland the guy was already sentenced so what do you want Singaporeans to do? He prob won’t be able to see what you posted. He is a Singaporean so it’s our own business and not up to FTs to make comments. Internal affairs, get it?"
"8 months, he is so lucky"
23 YEARS OLD SINGAPOREAN ...ANY COMMENTS. NOT FOREIGNERS...IF FOREIGNS I BELIEVES ALOT OF COMMENTS HERE....
This event is only the tip of the iceberg.
...not surprising this mat on drug..DRC have 50% of them most time... its already a history in Spore...
This god damm idiot. Ram into an innocent lady and caused her to have permanent brain damage! This guy should be sentenced to foot the full treatment fees of that lady!
No rotan ?
Wow..good citizen..hahaha
"When this breed produces too many, most grow up without much if any proper upbringing.
So what has the elected President got to say? lolololol"
""".... Low said that his client did not flee the scene, but simply left as he “was not aware” that it was his duty to remain behind.

yeah sure....he borrowed a phone so that he could give a false phone number. Low thinks the judge is stupid.

""... Sha’if then borrowed a passerby’s mobile phone to call for an ambulance. He gave the Singapore Civil Defence Force hotline operator a false phone number."""
See. Malay again!
"""did not flee the scene, but simply left""

I am not insulting you, I am only laughing at your stupidity"
Shocking...did the police find where he got the drugs ?
"What do expect when you have ""Clueless Monkeys in White"" in charge?"
"Local in trouble with law, name, SINGAPOREAN all printed out. Foreigners in trouble with law, nationality disappeared.........!!! Why????????????"
"This idiot knew what he is out to ""sneak"" attack on the other sporean by racing & speeding his machine thru places filled with pedestrains especially near mrt exit or bus stopo. He has no regards for other sporean's safety as he knew all along he will hit innocent people in his speeding path. He even tried to avoid detaction by using others' hp. This showed he is well-prepared for any consequences. He should be given heavier deterent sentence and not juz in terms of moths. He muz be made to pay back to thar poor lady for causing her lose her life time job as an accountant. Then carrying a hidden knife means he is ready to kill if confronted, Looks like he is out ot do harm onto other sporeans. Many youths nowadays carry hidden weapons and most of them are melays......They have an agenda i supposed!!!"
Singapore malays are still stupid. Thought they are smarter than their neighbouring cousins.
My heart goes out to Goh. Her life has been drastically changed b'coz of one idiot.
sadly because of one idiotic fool cause so much damages to her family.
Typical Brown people problems
how do you disqualify these foreign drivers from driving all classes of vehicles in the first place??
"save cost? times hard? Seriously?
These drivers earns well above 15k a month even quit their jobs for it. Used to be sgd10 now it's sgd30 EACH passenger, and X8 passengers at that per trip. Had been seeing these for past 30years now only found out?"
Easiest is to check at Customs. U will see these vehicles going in and out more than once a day and usually with a full load of people.
"These are 100% Malaysian drivers. Confiscate their vehicles and banned them from entering our country again. See if they'll do that if MYR$1 = SIN$3. Trying to ""potong-jalan"" our law-abiding taxi uncles of their income. Well done LTA."
Anything can happen.It very dangerous to go into their car without a valid insurance..
"I ever see Police drive the Police car to hawker ctr buy food.
Can I also sue the Policemen for misuse of Tax-payer Asset ?
PAP, What say you ?"
"When times are hard, people will resort to whatever available means to save costs and enhance profits/income. Gov can come up with pioneer/merdeka packages when votes matter. How about a 'low-earners' package to help Singaporeans survive in an Sg where constant cost-escalating living conditions now prevailing? PAP will gain further votes and will be unstoppable in the next GE, I'm sure!"
The government allowed Uber and grab to start illegal taxi services and this is the tip of the iceberg. More to come. Many will use pirate vehicles to do whatever they like.
"They deserve it, I'm happy our government is tightening up the rules"
"LTA only caught 3 of them, there are hundreds of them, LTA has not checked on GRAB vehicles those are going to Johore Bahru to pump PETROL for cheap transportation for Singaporean
The causeway jam is cause by 60% GRAB DRIVERS and must NOT be allow to go to JB to pump petrol or they $70 tax to go JB"
Authorities slzzping...now only take action bcos need monies
There must be someone inside the airport working jointly with these group of drivers so as to direct them to these illegal vehicles.
"GE coming near, Our Lickering Dog was order to report FAKE news.
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-household-income-grew-in-2018-income-inequality-11238462"
shocking fine of 1300 sgd will stop these drivers from their ten years driving activities. shocking 4 drivers out of thousands caught is an achievement by LTA after 10 years investigation and undercover work. well done
"Y only 4 ? They r very much more than that.
This show that u r not doing your job."
Govt Need money
Hope they won't get all of them i need their service to send me to johore. Its really hard to take the bus or the taxi. Sometimes it so crowded during festive season.
LTA ....Licence Threatening Authority
LTA must follow up with tighter control of these illegal services provided by foreign country and driven by a untrained/licensed foreigner. It is a potential hazard to the innocent passengers and rob off the money from local licensed drivers.Vehicles to be confiscated and foreign drivers heavily fined and bar from entering Singapore. Local driver caught should be bar from driving for 5 years and fined heavily. Local driver to force to think twice and not taking the life of the passengers for a free drive!
do spot check tuas road / south area. lots of unlicensed chauffeurs.
Should fine the passengers as well.
"Uber and Grab did that,but were approved to operate,when they came on board to compete with taxis.What is going on...""Pirate"" taxis disallowed ????"
"Go to both the customs checkpoint in tuas and woodlands, you can catch faster. Look out for Alphard and Velfire, it's the most common when see inside has many passengers till it's full"
"Govt can only use insurance to frighten the passengers, they don’t know and unable to catch the majority, last year only catch 12 , despite 400k to 500k travellers and passengers travel across both causeway"
"Well, firstly, LTA is merely giving offenders very light punishments with a slap of only SGD$1400 for 2 offences committed. The authority is getting into their games because a company may be eyeing on this $$$ making biz or it had impede into their earning. Lets take about insurance. Do you think they really care? Just another legislative made for higher penalty. Now that I'm talking, might as well say that our safety has never been within fair consideration. For those who drive & travel to the other side using public, have u ever see a BUS filled with humans? Like packed sardine? I seriously wonder if insurance do cover as the bus is way over the insured limit. Why are they not doing anything?"
LTA Just Discovered this?This has been going on for ages.
About time. The illgarl services have been going on for a while.
"Good, Now those stupid 70% face difficulty on Living and start doing illegal job in order to have a living.
Greedy PAP are dealing with their 70% supporters. Hahaha Good, ....Hmmm Stupid 70%"
what about foreign van ? lorry ? hehe...
this is very common since 8 years ago. I think SG is playing the hard ball on my already due to the tuas incident.
A number of their chauffered driven is in changi airport T4
"COE too high, they want to get back some cash.

LOL"
"Soon when you fart, You will also get fine for contamination of environment ."
Too much of these nonsense pirate cars and traditional taxi drivers are throwing back their keys to the company and called it a day.
"Must be oppies. Hate gov, break law, got caught, try to change gov. You can’t beat the fumb ducks at this logic. LOL"
霸王车
"There are many services done by foreign vehicles. Might even be Singapore owners. Check online!!! Pick up from Singapore to Senai airport, Changi to JB, so many combinations....
LTA...don't be bloody lazy...go and do the research...as these are taking away businesses in SG meant for SGreans.
Politicians...these illegal chauffers from Malaysia are taking away tax revenue....which is needed to pay your annual millions!!! (this will grt these fckers spring into action!! LOL)"
Good job done by LTA.
"Who wants to sue and expose their identities in court?? The DECENT THING to do is to provide LIFETIME FREE MEDICAL TREATMENT for those affected victims as a form of compensation. If MOH Minister Gan cannot do that, then he must resign."
"Quote : """"..HIV data leak: Affected patients can sue MOH for loss of data, says Gan Kim Yong..""""..

Sue govt leh, whats the chances of winning ??"
"18 years ago, my grandfather went missing from my uncle's house. Police report was made at AMK police station, and my grandfather, being lost and homeless for months, went to the old Tanglin police station to ask for help, I think none of the officers on duty can understand hakka, and they never check the missing person's report and happil got rid of him by sending him to a old age home where he fell, broke his hand and hit his head and passed away from the trauma at 92 years old. When my uncle questioned the officer, he was actually told that the family can sue MHA."
"HIV data leak: Affected patients can sue MOH for loss of data,......or Singaporeans can vote me out in the next General Election for loss of confidence in me as the million-dollars minister, whichever way is more viable and realistic."
Obviously he knows the victim will not dare to sue because that will really expose themselves. That’s not what the victim wants. I think the logical demand is Gan should resign to be take full responsibility instead to making all kinds of excuses. Done deal no?
Lawyers are the only winners. Government handles the case and compesates the victims all with taxpayers money.
"Gan boh yong is talking thru his aas! Can sue any govt body in Sg? What abt statutes and provisions in law that prevent common citizens from taking govt officials to task? Like how the family of the late Pte Dominique Lee who tried to take MOD to court but failed due to the Govt Proceedings Act.And to add insult to injury,they were asked to pay legal costs to the govt for filing a ""frivolous,vexatious and abuse of the court process"" case as ""the govt is Indemnified from being sued for negligence for deaths and injuries"".
Many years ago a top doctor from Gleneagles Hospital was ruthlessly penalised for merely challenging MOH to define some regulations set by MOH by none other than our late ""founding father"" who famously declared, ""If anyone takes on any govt official,it's tentamount to taking on the whole govt and the Entire Govt will come down on upon them"". The poor doctor was never heard from again."
Wow. Opening challenge to Singaporeans. Knowing few can afford the legal fees.
He's smart. He knows patients won't dare sue because will expose their identity further. That's why he can say something like that...
How come I feel like he is daring patients to sue MOH? Because he knows the patients can never win?
"If the minister is serious about his statement of suing, then why the same was not said for the 1.5M patient's data that was stolen ?"
"So many precedents have already shown that the ministries and ministers enjoy immunity, above the law."
"Hmmm... sounds more like issuing an open challenge than showing compassion for the victims. By the same token, can victims of Singhealth's data breach, Singpost's undelivered mail and MINDEF's fallen soldiers' families also sue sue sue???"
"Honestly speaking, Gan knows his cards well. It’s hard to prove actual damage from the leak and even more so, to quantify the damage. Also, legal matters are rich ppl game. Don’t be fooled by his “generous” statement."
"VOTE Gan KY out is FREE .
arrogant minister in history - not happy .... free to take legal action ... he did not proposed any solution or discuss with the the affected patients before unaccepted arrogant talk .
VOTE him out !
what happen to PM LHL ? keep silent ! fire him - GKY or we are ready to VOTE LHL PAP and low perform minister out by next GE ."
Sue MOH? Using the peoples’ monies to compensate while minister salaries increase?
"He invited those affected to talk to him rather than sue.
Yes he will give them tea, cakes, ang pow and tell them to close the case."
If sincere just compensate the affected victims for data breach.
It is perfectly correct to sue the government for negligence. He had managed to track down the culprit and could lead to extradiction act later and that is why he can talked in this manner. The SGH stolen data 1.5 m and dead quiet. Noone can you can sue?
You make mistake and used our Singaporean resources to pay for your mistake. Are you going to increase all medical bills so to top up back this money?
"Can sue.. but can the person win the case and be compensated before he kick the bucket? How long will the trial last and will the person live that long ? These are the questions that the patient will have to ask himself , in addition to legal cost."
Only way the Minister must accept his wrong and not further trying to push the blame to others. You are paid million dollars and you should resign for it.
"How come for all the MOH fiascos to date, the Health Minister is still not make to be responsible?"
"First of all the rightful thing for you to do is own up and resigned. That will not only save you the embarrassment and be respected. Your offer asking those affected to sue MOH and the Government shows how insincere you are. Why ? You know, I know and everybody else knows that those affected carrying this disease needs total confidentiality and will never ever want to be made known publicly. So by suggesting as such do you think they will come forward just like that despite the leak. There could be a thousand and one with the same names etc. How alarming as a Minister for you to suggest something out of the ordinary. Do you think they want be shamed further? Think about it not one not twice not three times but a thousand times. If you are truly sincere, apart from resigning you should work out a much more favorable compensation and thats it. There is no necessity to shame them further. Thats why I always said Mediocre Ministers and in this Government plentiful."
He knew that the victims cannot win that’s why he dare to ask them to sue.
"Did he say families of patients that died in SGH Hep C fiasco (gross mismanagement and control of procedures) can sue MOH/SGH? No, he said ""No Blaming Culture"". How many million$ has he pocketed already since 2015?"
"""But we encourage them to talk to us, we will discuss with them what are the ways to help them and to support them in whichever way we can,” Gan told the House.""

You says you will help them ? LoL"
Mistakes made and still talk big?
MOH should give compensation to loss of HIV data and medical records. MOH has failed to take action knowing there are abnormalities in the system . Should sue only when compensation looks cheap
"Sue for how much? Going by how the government controls the judicial system, you’re lucky to get $50...a smile, an apology and a statement that reads ‘we can and will do better’ and have such and such system in place, with another bogus committee of inquiry...until the next hacking takes place"
"Sure, sue them in court. No need to look at the list the whole world will also know he/she has AIDs. These PAP faarks are really cunning. Further what compensation will be awarded? S$1k? Please. Victims should be allowed to inject their blood into the Health Minister as compensation."
"In other words, sue all you want, the garhmen is not afraid of anyone or anything because they are untouchable. No need to be responsible for anything. No need to be accountable for anything."
You should resign to take responsibility
talk so much for wat.just resign la
"Sue the MOH ?
At least must raise $1 million .
They also must expose themselves.
Thats why Gan dare to say this word because he knows these people dont have this kind of money and wont expose themselves."
"Now I understand and have a better picture. Why foreigners dare to bully our blue Singaporean. Our own country government treated their blue citizen like dirt. Instead of helping the victim, he challenged them. Are you telling our citizen this is not your responsibilities. What is your motives of challenging victims. To expose themselves voluntarily and you can just say HIV no longer confidential. If so can you convince the public to accept the HIV victims. No doubt we know that HIV can only spread through direct contact without preventive device you are really an unprofessional minister. Which I think you dont fit to be a minister of health. If there is a outbreak of any infectious disease in Singapore, I can understand how your ministry attitude towards the outbreak. Because you are not involved. Is only the healthcare worker facing the risk and not you. Sitting in your comfort zone and wait for the feedback or data. Example SGH case. What did your auditor do. Having coffee with CEO, and claimed that audit done with 100% infection control."
"Wow, such bold statement. Asking the patients to sue without a chance of winning."
"Where to find the data, I want to avoid them"
Mr Gan your job is on the line.
Though public can sue govt for negligence but history shown they can never win. Moreover where to get $$$ and political stamina to sue a dictatorial regime? There are already many precedents whereby whoever tried to sue govt ministries got themselves counter-sued in the end and bankrupt with huge litigation debts.
"Do we need the PAP minister to tell us that we can sue MOH? You can sue, but can you win?"
Tax payer money to compensate mah..is okay to sue.
Again Tax Payer suffer. All compensation not from the Minister who did not do his job properly. At the end the tax payer suffer but his salary is million. So what is the point paying him which l believed there is someone can do a better job.
Talk like everyone is so rich like the minister where all have lawyer representing them. Don't think any lawyer want to be associated with ordinary people who has nothing to protect other than a HDB flat.
"Health Minister is talking Rubbish. Instead of the affected patients filing a law suit, why don't he resign instead. Faster results, cheaper in terms of cost as your pay is much less than a law suit payout.

Just resign, then problem solved. All will be happy.
Hope to hear the good news of your resignation soon."
"your sue MOH; MOH loses, pays compensation from taxpayers' money; minister still get fat bonuses; case closed. People still lose."
"1.Sue Gov chance of winning is as low as Zero % to win
2.Legal Fee is very Expensive
3.As HIV patient, sueing the Gov is prone to more self expose to the Public that I am HIV infected
The above 3 points will almost make none to try sue the Gov"
"Very canning Goh, surely hiv carrier dare not expose themself"
"Are PaP QUALIFIED
in HEART, SOUL, VALUES and CAPABILITIES

to hold
ANY MINISTERIAL POSITIONS ????????

The ISSUE on HAND
is due to REVENGE ACTIONS

TAKE by the 2 LGBT CRIMINALS
AGAINST the GOVT

as they ARE AGAINST that the FOREIGNER lgbt with HIV POSITIVE
is FORCED to be DEPORTED

when the GOVT allowed ANOTHER 5,800 FOREIGNERS
with HIV POSITIVE
to STAY in SINGAPORE !!!

What BIG FIASCO due to the very OWN DOINGS of the GOVT !!!"
"gov so slack nowadays you see you all votes for this, minister high pay while locals report to forginers boss. all locals report to your forginers boss now."
"Government hospital money is singaporean money. Got sue its wasted money. Their big salaries with big ego doesnt justified paying so much. Most mps have no prior experiences. Its a mess. Parliament have all the soft and yesman people. How to succeed. All of them take care of each other-just like korean sitcom. What singaporean wants a leader people. who have foresight. Guts to talk and see through. Thick skinned on investment. Humbleness and apathy in dealing with others. SInay SORRY. Is it to say sorry its a sign of weakness or we cannot handled the truth! Indonesia and malaysia are big brothers. Singapore must know when to talk go with the flow and not talk down on others.
Mr Gan can pay them a huge sum. Go for cosmestic surgeries and change their identities. Give them full time jobs for life.
Its suffering and worriedsome for them to daily worried when they will be exposed. Headache and heartache."
Need not sue but compensate us just like in UK
"Sure, sue MOH. Ah Loong will just hijack parliament again, be judge, jury, prosecutor, witness, defendant, etc .... Final outcome - Ownself Declare Ownself Not Guilty."
"If this data already breach since 2016 and our GOV know about it, how come now then admit? It seem our G becoming more and more untrustworthy? Hiding all the bad things from citizens? How many more citizens do not know?"
Please la! How Arrogant and obnoxious can one be by making that statement!!
Mr Gan knew that ordinary people do not have the means to hire a lawyer. So he wayang wayang to fool the people he is a nice man
"Who in their right mind, let alone AIDS patients, want to sue govt? All these victims want is for the rest of their lives to be well provided for. Why would they want to waste more money and time? The minister knew this, so he is just giving lip service and empty talk. Lol"
This arrogant GKY jolly well knows that HIV patients will not sue because they risk their identities will be revealed. GKY is an oxymoron
Sue MOH? Means sue for taxpayers money? GST will increase to 11%? Why dun u just resign to give the victims some closure lah. Why make the whole SG suffer for u? Haiz
"Election coming, anything you want is granted. But bear in mind, they'll counter sue you by claiming all these legal money if the judge is a kangaroo judge after pappies won the election"
""" We merely kept quiet just as during the Hepatitis C outbreak. But we did not cover up."" Said the defiant minister."
Who dare first to sue ? Common on.
"why make it so difficult just call for election and vote opposition and dig out why singapore reserves is gone. how did it happen , who did it, why it loss, who we buy the investment from , the name and the citizenship, why we buy high and sell low.
there are so many loop hole in this government not forgetting the Keppel in Brazil, not forgetting who gave the town council permission to invest in LEMAN, why is there a S$2 payout capital company involved in Aljunied town council computer in the past and why it is the ex-minister name in it."
This crooked Minister dare suggest to sue only because he is fully aware of the fraud perpetrated by Judges in Singapore in the name of Justice
"There are so many breaches on this case, Mr. Gan must take responsibility. We do not need Mr. Khaw's reminder of Japanese harikiri but to resign honourably."
This MP said can sue all because the ones affected are foreigners. But if it is local citizens only he'll say it's an honest mistake so let's move on. And no blame culture... Lol. Well done! You deserve your million dollar salary... Sinkies will continue to vote you. Please indicate the serial no. with the particular of the voter in the vote slip ok.
I don't like the tone Gan said about suing MOH. I got a funny feeling the whole health care cost in Spore is going to go up soon and also very high increase.
Eunuchs enjoy immunity
"Now with so many high pay MOH Officer, Y still can leak ?"
We need to know who ate the HIV patients to protect the society.
"Talk cxck lah! Sue MOH? Even if the affected patients won the case, which is very unlikely, the money still come from the tax payers and not the blurred, useless million$$$ minister lah!"
"Sue under what grounds? There are no privacy laws in Singapore to protect the individuals, the only reason he made that comment was that there is no basis in Singapore. Other than that the courts ............ LOL"
Ya right! and further expose yourself to the public?
You use tax-payer's money to settle all this legal issue......You talk as though you use your own money......Why this a-s-ol...still not fired??? After screw up after screw up.......Because he works in ANG MO KIO GRC.....KNOW HOW TO CARRY BALLS....
Actually there quite few cases just that it is kept under wrap. For instance remember the ex scdf boon who sue the ministry?
"this case clearly show the mistake and risk for the govt to openly accept too many PR and foreigners into Singapore. once these PR or foreigners committed a crime they can easily fled Singapore without regrets. They have no roots , families, or even assets here. Govt policy clearly backfire.
Although the health minister needs to answer to the public , but he will still be able to continue to hold on to his high salary post"
"who will be at the losing end? If MOH loses the case, tax payer and patient will be the one paying for it."
"Local victims will get chickenfeed, if anything, when they use local courts to sue govermin. Foreing victims will fare better because they can sue for more in their respective countries' courts..."
let the foreigners do it .they have the money and power....sinkies got money but can't win. what is the point right?
"How can our Authorities so relaxed that the American Mikh Brochez could be passed off as a healthy person with no HIV infection and with false educational qualifications?
The investigations were definitely not robust enough. I hope that no distinction is made in any criminal investigation between nationality, race and colour. This episode has thrown our Singapore into a very bad light.
Will our Authorities learn anything from this. More importantly, will steps are in place to ensure no repetition of such lapse incident.

Uncle Raymond"
"good suggestion,,,, sue MOH, then you pay, knn,, its our money!!!"
No need to say so much election coming fellow nike just do it
"""proving that they have suffered significant damage would be difficult""....the fact that this info can be dissiminated at will, at anytime to anyone is a catastrophic disaster that is impossible to put a dollar figure. the severity and damage is obvious altho the valuation of the damage difficult but that does not mean the person has not suffered enormously."
What a stupid proposition or suggestion. These are the kind of people we have as Ministers. Ok now we sue MOH and liability is not disputed MOH accepts liability and now there is the issue of damages. Where is the money coming from to pay damages? Taxpayers money?
So is Ler a HIV positive carrier ?
"First world minister. Such responsible comments to even sport/dare affected patients to sue MOH. Knowing that:

1) MOH does not fall under the auspices of the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA).
2) Suing mean additional public exposure for the affected patients
3) What are the chances of winning a case against a ministry (or in fact is the whole gov)
4) Even can win, compensate made also comes from tax payer

Nice move. This is what happens when your performance is mediocre and yet have salary pegged to corporate standard. Oh, not forget about the immunity!"
Hah?? Sue MOH?? Sue Mr Gan more like it.
resign and get lost.simple as that.think skin pap minister all the same.
"Sue ministry of health or sue minister of health? If it is ministry, then who is the person accountable ? Ministry is just an organisation. So if we sue the ministry, who is accountable ? CEO, director, or the minister himself ?"
"The overall picture is one of dismay even deep disappointment... SCDF, SAF, MOH incidents. Multiple COI, multiple ministerial statements. Add on the CPF, FT, Malaysia issues. What is next?"
Can sue loh. But cannot win have to pay costs somemore.
This is what 69.9% voted for. A minister who erred and am still arrogant enuf to dare victims to sue him. Its basically telling them they LL have to accept it. Thats our talented minister for u. Lol...
"From 2012 to 2013 when the leaked of info had surfaced, the timeline, till the release of Brochez from confinement, MOH has done little to ensure that pilfered information from him or even Dr. Ler, has remained within the four-walled. Purely, a guessing game from MOH that nothing was stolen by them despite the released of Brochez, and proven beyond doubt the incriminating information on the HIV patients was indeed stolen and hidden away during his imprisonment by the authority. MOH deserves the reprimand for not thorough in their initial investigation."
can they sue Mr Gan?
"that's why i say ministers are out of touch with ppl of the lower-tier in terms of $. please use logic to think: these patients already fork out part of their income to pay for the drugs to nurse their health, how would they have the $ to sue?"
Sue until Gan's pants drop. Ha ha ha.
Say No To Pap.....
"You sue only when the accused denies any wrongdoing. In this case, if you admit it's your ministry's fault, just discuss with the victims and compensate accordingly. You suggested that the victims can sue your ministry in this case means YOU DO NOT ADMIT TO ANY WRONGDOINGS OF YOUR MINISTRY?"
"All they know is sue, why don't he hang himself and let a dog gan his karchng kang"
Please include that Ler in your suit....
"Can SUE , and you going to 输till your pants drop"
"Gan Kim Yong is challenging individuals to sue the PAPPIES!! this is your chance, grab it!!"
Yeah and than you will be throw out of court and cost.
Can sue but judges are all LHL's dogs. What's the point!!!
How did Brochez manage to download the data from the MOH system? Thought it is important to talk about this and how to prevent future illegal downloading. Was this covered and I missed it?
"He challenge you to sue leh.
What kind of response is this.???????"
"As a matter of goodwill, MOH should give free drugs for all the affected Hiv patients"
"I would want to sue them, now the hole is open and our cpf is on holding, so why not collect back some with this loop hole."
"can sue ah ?? got shadow or not ?? -- oh, becoz there re aliens involved. -- how about singhealth leaked ?? can sue or not ??"
"9-10 Billions annual budget for MOH, how MOH burn budget?!! Keep increasing MEDICAL DOCTORS paycheck.
Even a FRESH graduate earn more than lots of experienced White Collar!!
Medical Professors that PROFESSIONAL?
F it, show what u have contribute not SHOW your A LEVEL cert or NUS DEGREE!!"
can the 1.5 million user stand up together and sue moh?
LOL! Got money or not? Not few thousands hor. Minimum low of tens of thousand. And if you lose chia lak. Still have to pay their lawyers. This time hundreds of thousands. Their lawyers more expensive mah.
The shameless Gan Gim Yong should step down.
"His support at his SMC kampung is strong this the arrogance.
He’s from the same kampung as those guys from his SMC.
Kaki lang"
"As long you are yes Man
LHL Will not fire them.
All Fire,who is going to
Assist LHL. definitely not
Opposition right."
Don't waste your time and money on suing MOH which is familee owned anyway.
"After hearing from Ng and Gan, I confirm I have lost faith in PAP under LHL’s leadership!
Highly paid leaders but inefficient what a joke LHL has left his legacy for his last days of his career!"
this shows how arrogant our garmen is. ccb
"Eg...A woman has aids.I see my friends or some people got close to her. Can I warned them, and leak the matter?Or should I let them be infected and die?

Not until Authorities can answer the awkward situation...

A leak can affect her business. Now, who would be the real victim?"
Would you say the same if you are responsible to pay for the damages?
"If sue and win, who is responsible and who paid the compensation? Out from the Minister pocket or from the Ministry? If from Ministry, the monies are still taxpayer monies, so....we Singapore citizens are still the losers."
"WHAT an unethical low-breed pariah answer, coming out of THOSE who are supposed to have 100% safeguard to prevent and uphold these irresponsible lowlife lapses from happening - to make NEWS hitting the HEADLINES every now & then, days without number - which is horribly and terrible incompetence exposed for our NATION to 100% kick-out these bunch of worthless goons & VOTE-IN OPPOSITION LEADERS into power to fix-up all their lowlife pariah messy, disastrous and damaging policies from the pit of hell that has disgracefully RUINED & WRECKED our homeland - pui !"
"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha …
But not loss of personal privacy.

HIV data leak: Affected patients can sue MOH for loss of data, says Gan Kim Yong."
"They know very well that most Singaporeans will not dare to sue the PAP Govt and chances are very slim or even zero chances to win against the Govt.

If you’re a man of honour and can take responsibility and have the honour to accept accountability then you shall resign."
Si Peh Gan
"Akin to saying: ""My boss wants to promote me or give me pay rise, what can you say?"" This is a very familiar situation here where the favoured gets recognised, advanced and rewarded while the rightful and deserving ones are left to oblivion."
"I do NOT agree with Gan Kim Yong's statement that the charges under the OSA were not pursued against American homosexual criminal Brochez because they would have resulted in a light sentence compared with the other charges the criminal was already facing.
This explanation is completely UNACCEPTABLE.
It is so pathetic.
The American homosexual criminal Brochez committed a very serious offence under the OSA. Brochez stole or abetted stealing of secret data from Singapore government and published the secrets online in the Internet.
He MUST be charged under the OSA and it has nothing to do with whether Brochez will get a light sentence or a heavy sentence.
Gan Kim Hong is a minister.
He cannot make such terribly atrocious statements in Parliament."
"Sue the ministry?
Was it a joke?
They don't sue you,
You already lucky.
Sue man in white,dig
Your own grave."
"Of course, taxpayers money will be used when the courts award against the govermin, rite ah gan?"
"Wow GKY sure mixes well with Indians.!!
When SGH overdose patient with Lignocaine never encourage to sue as it lead to patient death.
Hep C virus transmission happened at SGH due to negligent oso nvr encourage to sue.
Now LEAK data, encourage to SUE?!! MOH under GKY sure know how to set boonfire.!!"
"""I dare you to sue us!""? LOL!"
"haiz, no other solution? Want us to be a litigacious country like USA? Want us to be litigacious like our gahment???? Sue, sue, sue... more details come out. And who benefit? Only lawyers. wth."
Those victim got to take out their own money now!! What is the expected amount?At least must ensure them that govt. would provide them an equivalent job/salary if they lose their job becoz of this incident.
save cost n lack of due diligence ??
Why sues ? They should be entitled free medical treament A - Z for life.
"The basic question: what are the chances? and what are the legal causes?
Now under LKY times, many heads will be chopped if things 'leak' till this extent.
Without this grandpa looking, many 'smart' people are simply behaving mischievously and naughtily."
he will be sued will be better!!
Good play.
Mr Gan has no control over MOH or he is not in the loop? Its take him 2 years and more to think of solution whether to keep or tell. The police whats investigative job they are doing. All are paid highly but i seriously doubt about their abilities. Dont tell me MOH goes round the standard protocols. In ability and lying with eyes open. Singaporean dont buy that. Listening more will make me daft!
"Sue MOH then your CPF money will be forever, Minister should be SACKED or ASK TO LEAVE THE CABINET, HE IS NOT FIT TO BE IN SG GOVERNMENT"
Three words - class action suit
Sue till their pant's drop .
"How arrogant the reply from Gan because MOH can't be sue and he won't lost his millions dollars job! that is what the true color of them. No compassionate, just greedy..."
GKY ....should GO and Go FAST ....His Head should roll ....keeping this matter under lid since 2012 ...and now unable to keep this under lid no more ....go public ......information taken by FTs ...imported by the same system and policies in place ....surely this is stinking to high HELL .....while they the Elites are basking in the Millions ...resting on their laurels and proclaiming self-given Dignity in Millions ....What do you think?
"This crooked lying idiot is fully aware that Miscreants Judges like Chan Seng Onn, Woo Bi Li, Belinda Ang, Lee Seu Kin, Tay Yong Kwang, Tan Siong Thai and so many others are sycophants of the crooked political system and especially the Health Minister and his officials, and protect them with full blessings of their Court of Appeal using anachronisms like Bolam to deprive those who need protection the most."
"QUOTE
The patients affected by the HIV data leak are free to take legal action against the Health Ministry, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong in Parliament on Tuesday (12 February).
UNQUOTE

GKY ..who are you taking for a ride with this statement ....as it is ..these groups rather live anonymously and remain unknown ....this leak breached their safety existence ...and you are asking them to sue the G ....you ought to be ashamed at your own intelligence ....you are indeed insensitive and think that you are the dignified ones along with the Elite Clan of Whiter than White ....What do you think?."

Faith and Trust have been Lost and Betrayed. Period."

The stench of PAP is strong in this one.
"Those worried sick about their HIV...go and read up about Urine Therapy, check up on testimonials, contact the UT experts overseas. UT is free, your own urine. It has many claims of cure against cancer and other serious diseases. Nothing to lose, nothing to pay either."

No one can sue the govt except ....nevermind.
"Minister behaving like gangster.. this is like how a gangster would behave, do something wrong and challenge people to ""hit me lah!""."
this bloody Ler is culprit. why he passed the data to his angmo Bf? why no charge against him.? instead we now chasing after a ghost ang mo who did nothing wrong except expose what he was given
Weird...why indtigate pp to sue lei..too much monies dont know where to spent huh?
Is he dumb or what? Asking the HIV patient to sue the Govt. The whole of SG will know the person had aids with his/her pictures all over STOMP or the newspapers!
What about papees...kick out of gov
Papees elect.dem yet encoutage sueing
Typical impenitent arrogance.
"How many f ups did this millionaire you foolishly voted for make? Still let him make more money arh?

Aiyah old man, you're clearly out of your league. You want to wait for the once sterling reputation of our renowned healthcare sector to be further dragged through the dirt? People are increasingly heading to so called third world centres for medical care. PH, Thailand, even Malaysia. What a clown old man Gan. Really hara kiri yourself man."
He wants to play with FIRE. I think the LGBT community is no longer the closet queens of ysteryears. If they do gang up and sue. I think MOH will lose their panties.
What a turd! Learn how to speak in public!
"Why SG keeps useless ministers like Gan, Ng, Khaw, Indra, Teo etc...... and their skin so freaking thick? Not easy leaving 26 months of bonuses job?"
Will sue until your pant drop
How can you even let anyone download the data is mind bogglingly stupid.
N still 70% percent idiots have faith in them
One of the infected must be tulip coz he said he love to bang a lot of pros.
"haiyo oppies, take off pants let you shoot also complain ..."
GKY once again you are proving to be an idiot!
"errr .. MOH ah .. actually Singaporeans are more concerned with how MOH can lose such serious, suicidal inducing data, than how or who leaked the data to public. I'm sure our good men at SPF will hold whoever are the perps accountable.

Now, tell us how citizens can hold MOH accountable?"
"Can the govt please explain why it was possible to switch blood samples? If this really is the case , it also means that there is a person walking around who is not HIV positive but is diagnose as HIV positive ?"

"Singapore deported Mr. Mikhy Farrera-Brochez and now Singapore wants him back?
Mikhy claims that Sg authorities have taken the evidence which proves his innocence to certain charges but has conveniently 'lost' it.
He also said he kept additional copies of the evidence in a safe place.
Besides, the American officials also told him that Singapore is not co-operating or working with them(US counterparts).
it is very unlikely he will come back to Singapore to assist with investigations. He will do it in the US."
"HIV positive patient's medical records are confidential but everybody knows this Ameircan is HIV-positive.
Who leaked his medical record....erm...who leaked his medical record?"
"Did the Sg authorities shoot their own feet, again?
Mikhy Farrera-Brochez produced proof that he did make contact with the American law makers."
"All this allegation's.....will certainly prevent the extradition to Singapore. I think our million dollar minister's knew about it...........They let him go......Just for public eye-wash ""They is saying one thing"".........This is indeed scandal which expose's weakness within our ""infallible image""..................."

"I wont totally write off Brochez as a liar because he mentioned some people he had contacted in the agencies, and based on what they alleged did/said to him, I'm not surprised."
Out tax payers monies n High gdp per capita due to this
"Yes, the American homosexual criminal is a pathological liar.
Brochez targeted the homosexual doctor Ler and used sex as a weapon to induce or force the latter to steal secret HIV data.
This crime committed by Brochez is not for fun. It is for PROFIT.
It is for MONEY $$$.
He wanted to used the data to threaten HIV patients to pay money or else their name and identity and HIV positive status would be revealed.
Brochez had a long list of names.
It is a GOLD MINE. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.
Why Singapore did not charge Brochez under OSA is beyond comprehension.
Brochez should have been jailed 50 years and subject to 20 strokes of the cane.
Now they let him go.
Brochez has so much secret HIV data that he can leak them for the next 30 years on the Internet.
The claim by Gan Kin Hong that officials will scour the Internet for such leaks and inform Singapore authorities to block those sites, is silly.
First of all it is not possible to be omniscient. You cannot be on the alert 24/7 for the next 30 years to monitor the entire Internet . You would be worn out.
Secondly, Internet users can quickly make copies (before it is blocked) and spread that info. Thus leading to exponential growth of the information tree.
You cannot stop the leaks.
One leak by Brochez becomes a multitude of leakers all over the world within a few days."
This should not happen if health minister Gan Kin Yong has foresight of what going to happen. So many lapses happening under PM LHL’s leadership and the worst is these 4G ministers are the most well paid ministers.
"Supper idiiot!
The other issue is how our MOE can hired such idiot to teach without getting caught?
This is to show how incompetence our scholars are. All want high post and getting high pay, but most cannot work. If can this idiot would not get hired in our poly. Understand there are other like him still in the system."
“a pathological liar”. world highest paid and worse health minister in SG history - Gan KY always NO 1 not this guy . GKY are professional pathological liar .
"This guy is challenging the Singapore government and totally embarrassing our PAP leaders like they are fools. Seriously, this guy send emails to so many places to tell them he has the data but the Singapore government don't even know or able to do anything until it is finally leaked online. What's the word? Incompetent, dishonest leaders at MOH. Useless prime minister who is a weak leader."

It is DMT that the authorities have to worry about, because it may undo your individual psychology as well as unravel the structure of society and most organized religions, if too many people take it.

Such a small issue on animals cannot do right what about human issues. Worst. It Wasted taxpayers money and speak bad about the govt. Mistake over mistake. No head roll all these years.

"Another PR show by our scholars/ministers. What is Total Defense in our current context? Who is involved? Who should be involved? Everyone and everywhere??? Little India Riot case - our first responders were attacked by the rioting foreigners. Did we see the foreign bosses or their same compatriots rushing to help defuse the situation? And we now have what, like about 1,000,000 of them. New citizens - 22,000-26,000 EVERY year but they are not drafted into any mandatory total defense tasks - just deadwood living off the security provided by the locals. This group is like what, maybe 6-8% of our resident population? Every citizen involved, hor? Foreign talents - yeah, the HIV-ang moh leaking our health data, or cyclist throwing bottle at Ah Pei in lorry. Help us be more secure or more problems for us? And this group is another what, 12-15% of our resident population? So our Total Defense is actually dependent on about 30-40% of the total population.- and this include babies, students, females, old people, the kelong president, etc. Thus ""Total Defense"" is really depended on just maybe 15-25% of able-bodied, Singapore-born locals. Maybe more apt to rename it ""Quarter Total Defense"", hor."

In honor of the sacrifices made, France offered a plot of cemetery in Normandy to bury US servicemen (and those of other participating nations) who died on D-Day landings and the liberation of France from Nazi Germany.

Wouldn't it be a wonderful world if the residents OBEY the REGULATION and the relevant authorities DO their JOB?
Why the need to ask the public whether is there a need of enforcement? If its clearly stated that its not allowed then the authorities should already take action. So what if the person in violation is a RC member or whatsoever. Doesn't mean he or she has immunity to the enforcement.
Ban burning of incense in HDB and residential area. Go to temple instead.
Yes much overdue. Issue is prevalent in the North East estates where a number of homes are used as temples.
"Having laws and enforcing them are 2 diff matters. 1 is to please the public, 1 is to really protect the public."
It is banned! So just enforce it! People in charge of the enforcement should do their job!!!!!!
This is a burning issue that need to be resolved once and for all.
G will only react if a HDB burns down. (Just like the hacking incident) my problem with G is that they are reactive in nature formulating policies only when there is a crisis.
Also remove idols from void deck. That is a public space.
"What enforcement??? It's about the well-paid authorities FAILED or chose NOT TO ENFORCE the rules. Make a guess why they're so 'nice' to the violators ,to the extent that illegal activities are openly tolerated?"
"Outright ban needed, stiff fines and confiscation of HDB for repeated offence."
"These burning are dangerous, Sometimes after burning the owner did not attend to it and this may cause fire as some burning ash may fly to clothes hanging out there cause it to catch fire, We do respect other religion, but hopefully other do respect our right to breath clean air and our safety."
"Is already a policy, so, just enforce it! What is so difficult?! asking is only wayang!"
These indiscriminate burning should be banned long time ago. We blamed the Indonesians burning that caused the haze but in our backyard we dont practise prudence and common sense. This is not taoist practise but according to Tao monk it is created by people. However I totally agree there should be enforcement on this issue.
"Can burn the Town Councils for promoting such burning, too?"
"Even those Barrels are not effective. I think the best solution is to allow incense burning at temples and if required, book timing. They people must buy the incense materials from the temple.
Peak hours prices 2X."
"Yes! No exceptions for grassroot leaders,Rc members,Por lum par committee members.....etc...No special privilege for unlawful act. Let's Do It Together ! Cheers ....!"
It is not that more enforcement must be taken against indiscriminate burning. It is more like the law has not ben uniformly enforced and applied these days. It is about the law becoming arbitrary and hence not serving its function in society...…..
It is a fire and health hazard! the authorities have to really look into curbing this. Its long overdue
"This burning of joss paper is a carry-over from decades ago, when most people live in kampungs and burn their rubbish in their gardens. It was OK then, because the houses were further apart and the surrounding greenery helped minimize the effects of the smoke. But now that we're living in packed HDB flats and there's also the need to save the environment, I think the Taoist religion should also move with the times. I mean, now that we are going cashless, don't they also have ibanking in the netherworld? It would be so much more convenient and environmentally friendly -- not to mention neighbor-friendly -- if they just do e-transfers instead of burning paper money. Perhaps some enterprising company can start offering such a service?
And, yes, there should be more stringent enforcement against indiscriminate burning anywhere, not just in HDB flats. Wherever it takes place, it poses a fire hazard and may cause serious health issues for the very young and old, especially those with asthma or breathing problems."
"Why does the Traffic Police fine cars parked alongside churches on Sundays & temples, but not vehicles illegally parked outside mosques on Fridays? This has infuriated S'poreans for decades. I thought it is regardless of race, language or religion in our country."
Police also can't do anything.
Singapore finds it difficult to enforce a no-burning rule because the majority of offenders are Chinese and the open burning of joss paper is deeply rooted in their culture.
They waiting for someone to die from fire then they think of ways to enforce.
Need poll to tell hdb residents that burning outside your unit is illegal and hazardous?
YES !!!
"Ban it altogether, bad for health and environment, also we don't know what chemicals are in the joss paper"
"Better filtration system is required for such burning activities, whether in HDB blocks or any other places."
a decades old problem still can't be solved just show the uselessness of our minister.
HDB should enforce and disallow any burning to be on the corridor. Safety first!
"I respect this is the traditional way of burning incense papers. Please do it with care as it may cause inconvenient to others or fire hazard too. There’s always a public burning bin for you located at the ground open area to do so.

Let us live a happy neighbourhood life."
Yes i wouldn't children to breath those unhealthy smoke.
The authorities should just ban all these public burnings. They are not just dangerous but adding to the already stifling air quality. And here we are always talking about climate change.
I don't find mosques tt loud la. Our own getai and funeral procession lagi louder leh.
Recently in our estate there are inconsiderate people who burn joss sticks and candles on the grass and after burning left them all sticking out of the field... and kids are all playing and in danger of stepping on and getting their feet poked by all these sticks left behind. I think this poll should extend to public places.
It's about time! Every time my neighbours (upstairs and downstairs)burn the papers I always get jittery because I am so afraid that it's residential fire and I want to evacuate my kids and myself asap. Call me paranoid but there have been many cases of residential fires recently.
"Last night, 12 Feb 2019, Tue, close to midnight, there was massive burning of incense paper. The common corridor and premises were filled with smoke, white and black ashes.The air was extremely smelly and pungent. The government should ban burning in highly populated residential areas due to air, health and fire hazards."
Nothing happened authorities keep quiet. Big fire than the authorities will say we are looking into this issues and as for now no burning in the hdb corridor This dialogue seek and tired lol. Incidents happened government take action. We will look into this matter Ha Ha Ha.
"When applying for new HDB flats, HDB needs to ask Tenants if they are:

(1) Smokers
(2) Burners"
Burning joss paper in the common corridor & indiscriminate parking that obstructs traffic outside mosques are both anti-social acts & not acts of religious devotion. Why aren't the relevant authorities enforcing the rules in both instances.
"If smoking can be banned at corridors and void decks with NEA enforcement, why is indiscriminate burning of joss paper not enforced. These activities could cause major air pollution with poisonous gasses that could choke others and worse of all could cause a fire incident"
Allocate a destinate area for burning...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU73FssBvP8
"please BAN this burning at HDB flats corridors and all other residential area.

please confiscate all the burning bin put outside the corridors.

HDB is not doing their work when coming to complaints such like this.
even they (HDB) came and have a talk with those people, the owner still continue with the burnings.

Don't just talk nonsense and sit on this matter. we don't want the whole HDB flat burn down. Please remember that now almost all flat built is above 24 storey and if one floor goes up in smoke - how do fast can HDB can come and rescue? Remember nowadays studio flat is built over 24 floor and almost all with elderly people.

But again these elderly also refuse to follow orders. They don't think of others but only themselves. We don't go against religion practice but we are talking about safety of overall.

Please educate these people.

Some even hang at main gate and saying they are burning inside the house not outside???

Can HDB make common sense to them or still want to sit on this matter?

Don't wait till fight breakout on religion matters., this is not going to help."
No action will be taken unless someone get hurt or die. That is how the govt work
Burning incense paper along residential corridors creating heavy smoking than cigarette smoking.why only ban n find$ cigarato smokers har ???$$$$
Burning incense in hdb corridors and under the block should be banned. Follow the rules. What happen if there is a fire ??
This is purely an extreme and isolated case. Need to sensationalise the news here???
"KNN. Surely must Banned this unsafe act & irresponsible behaviour. If i need to burn joss paper, i will used specialized bin instead. We are the majority and we should think about other races too. We should not burn joss paper openly like on the pavement!! Be considerate to ppl around us. This want also must teach ahh, use your innitiative!! Remember we once studied Social Studies in School? Be Considerate!!! Nahbeh"
"Hmm. ...Religious believe and matters of all kind should be widely discuss not only with the residents but with also the relevant religion council as a whole. If you totally ban burning of religious needs , others might want a total ban on prayers broadcast by mosque . So , it's a sensitive and delicate issue. Let's live and let live in our already stressful society."
I think it is alright to burn joss paper outside the house as it is part of the religious and chinese tradition practices of deities honor but fire safety it is better to put the bin a distance from the gate and plants outside of the house. I don't find it necessary to make a big fuss over such matter. It is all about consideration and respect with understanding within both partners. Yes it is wrong to sweep the dust to her neighbor doorstep as she should be sweep with a dustpan and throw it at her house dust din but the neighbor also need to respect and understanding her practice and advise her politely to put the bin a distance from her plants.
"YES, HDB officer should go around summon people"
So what i can smell cigarette smoke from neigbboos everyday
Just a suggestion why not let the power stations burn the offering and not let the head energy goes to waste.
why no votes? is it because the burning is related to the Majorities ( Chinese ). If the poll was regarding playing drums for indian weddings or festivals then the votes will be flooding in like no one's business. Inequality and biasness to the highest level
"if this wmn is RC member - please ask her to quit.
BAD example!

And how on earth can a person like this get in RC at first place?

Because of her husband?

PAP Organization - please investigate. Don't anyhow approve anyone with NO BRAIN as RC member."
Wonderful. Yet another Yahoo Newsroom 'survey' designed to stir division in Singapore.
Yes!
"After 5pm no enforcement officer on duty, so burn after 5pm, no problem LAH"
"what about upstairs neighbor dragging & squealing & banging & ... causing unbearable noises 24/7 / 365 ?? -- noise nuisance still going on despite various reports to TC, HDB & police & 2 police attendance. -- its becoming noise harassment & nothing anyone can do about it. -- this is in pipit road blk 92. -- try named & shame."
Can we also ban the imported to stay in hdb? Oh... They might convert to citizen by our belov pappies under cecaz
We should not take any action now. We must wait until one really bad fire incident involving incense burning then we can implement some sort of enforcement. More people will be onboard with the idea.
Open borders will resolve open burning issues
Those who protest are probably and most likely the xtains for they are not labelled protestants for no reason!
All should go burn at open lawn the parliament house.
"GO & DO all your mass burning & worship inside your temple as you all are not ABOVE THE LAW to do your flip-flop business when you have a TEMPLE PREMISE to do your burnings unlike CIGARETTE SMOKERS who are are banned & fined when cought for smoking, a mere habit which is hard to kick but yet LAW IS HEAVY on them doing so but YOU people have no excuse to abuse to litter other peoples' home & surroundings as hundreds of your temples are in every housing estate & no excuse for this uncivilised atttiude to carry-on to bother your neighbours, period ! !"
Why all the noisy fireworks last night? Ban them. They are dangerous and infringe on our sleep
Brain with problems. The evil spirits are very happy with his irresponsible acts. What are the Authorities doing? Very busy! Busy over what?
"We used to burn just outside our own door, but mum did not want ashes to keep flying back into the house, so then went downstairs to burn joss sticks and papers. Later even better, she said go temple pray pray will do. Our neighbour so bad, put his small burner at staircase and burn. If fire, cannot take life cannot use staircase, sure die liao. Neighbours should also keep their stuff inside their own house and not use the common corridor as store space, unless like shoe rack, 1 or 2 pot of plants neatly placed will do. But, unfortunately, HDB and Town Councils do not enforce accordingly untill and unless DEATH occurs."
Usually fires are caused by cigarette-buds and smokers. Ban tobacco now!
"Why should the police be encumbered? Such behaviours only exhibit the level of social norms and standard/quality of society. haiz.....50+yrs of social engineering and old habits of mumbo jumbos, hocus pocus are still stupidly entrenched. Sigh....."
"Silly goose - NO need to ask, just BAN it as this is very clear and exposes a fire hazard anytime & anywhere and STOP abusing our SCDF SINGAPORE SONS for fires created and caused by this inconsiderate selfish attitude & behaviour, period !"
"Let them burn. Makes private property more desirable.

Huat ah!"
"Beautiful...I am sure there will be an arrest if someone decides that Raffles Place open space is good feng-shui to burn incense papers. HDB corridors? Well, it is unseen, un-important, not deemed an environmental, health or fire hazard."
Wow! Fire like bakar satay
Why cant they burn it online?
"It is especially true that this is a very unhealthy way to offer whatever gifts and ghost $$$ to your beloved ones as well as ancestors. Imagine breathing in toxic fumes not only from burnt offerings BUT some oso threw in plastic packing into the fire causing much more toxic fumes that is more dangerous to patients or people with respiratory illness especially people with sinus and those with asthma! LETS EDUCATE THEM FOR MOST OF THIS ACT ARE PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION SO IT IS A DIE-HARD WAY OF TRADITION. I DON T THINK IT IS ANTI-SOCIAL SO DO NOT SPECULATE ON IT. MANY CHINESE PEOPLE WHJO ARE MY GOOD NEIGHBOURS ARE OSO AGAINST THE IDEA OF DOING SUCH UNHEALTHY WAY OF BURNT OFFERINGS. OSO I WOULD LIKE TO LIKE TO SAY THAT TO ACCUSE THEIR NEIGHBOUR OF SWEEPING THOSE FINE DUST TO THEIR DOOR-STEP AND UNDER DUST MATNEEDS PHYSICAL PROOF . SUCH FINE DUST CAN SETTLE ITSELF IN CREVICES AND IT IS NOT INTENTIONAL. THE PERSON WHO MADE THE COMPLAINT SIMPLY WANTED TO GIVE HER MESSAGE MORE WEIGHT. ANY WAY, WE THANK HER FOR RAISING THIS LONG OVERDUE PROBLEM IN OUR HOUSING ESTATE ESPECIALLY THOSE STAYING IN HDB PREMISE!"
Its time someone create an incense burning app for these people
At the most others burn mosquito coils.
"No, let it burn down. Nothing wrong with it."
"Ban if there is a fire safety issue, otherwise we should respect the customs of the locals and their religions. Multiracial country like us have to learn to be tolerant or else racial/ religion tension may occur like in the past. Younger generation have forgotten when we have curfews."
"It is not just HDB....they do this within CBD AREA also....This is done almost every year at prinsep street........NEA OFFICERS ACT BLIND...These very spot,i was caught two time for throwing cigratte butt........I think they guys using some kind of telescope or something......This burning occur's...more than 1 hour...very loud and nosiy.........none of them are caught or even warned

"The gods will be angry, so tread carefully. Election is coming soon."
Why the authorities not responding to this issues lol? Thaipusam playing instruments and residents complaining authorities take action lol. What law lol?? Thaipusam play musical instruments along roadside residents complain lol and action was taken lol. Why burning no action taken lol? Aiyooooooh.
Remove all loudspeakers from mosques. Noise pollution.
"You want to die....die burn joss paper....scared the govt catch you.....what you do...outsource it to ""FORIEGN WORKERS""....the govt most likely will not go after foreigners ....as singaporens........This could be good business model......"

"Slacking slack! Doesn't the authority has a law regarding this? Or are waiting for another catastrophe to happen, another death and another crap."
"Why not they burn themselves to offer themselves to the afterlife?
Helps to reduce the number of such nuiscance on this planet. And gradually bring it to non-existence. Peace to the World...no more air pollution!! Less trees being cut to make thems useless Joss Papers!!!"
KNN. always make me want to use profanity words. This want no need poll lah!!! Just table to Parliament this next few days and Penal Code!! See who dare do lah!!! Nahbeh.
District judge used common sense. Appeal judge used the word of the law. Appeal judge is correct. Judges shouldn't let personal judgement take the place of absent empirical evidence
"Why the hospital did not make him do a urine test or blood test on the day he was admitted.
If he had taken drugs , the result will show in his system and what kind of drug he has taken.
Then the hospital can match the result with the straw found in his posession."
our laws now is a joke!!!!!
This high court judge is fair and reasonable. Singh was found in an open area and any thing is possible. He was found unconscious.
"well, a leopard never changes its spot. he'll be back soon enough..."
why didnt mention have done urine test on him or not? result positive or negative ?
"This is year 2019 and in Singapore?! We cannot tell if anyone sabo him or he sabo himself?

Guess our school students can offer ideas on how to investigate? As part of their projects?

LOL"
Good judge - finally someone who understands equity.
"""Singh had been found lying unconscious at a void deck. He remained unconscious while being conveyed to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. ""
--------------------------------------------------

No CCTV footage of this man available before or around the time he purported lost consciousness???
Have the police /investigators done their investigations on this guy thoroughly??
If yes, and no concrete evidence were found to directly connect this guy to the red straw containing drugs, then the district judge is unwise to convict this guy.

The Appeal Court is correct to err in favor of this man's freedom and liberty, IF he indeed has no history drug offenses.

The Appeal judge exercises what is known in criminal law as the ""Blackstone's ratio"" ---- the idea that it is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer."
"Give that man the benefit of the doubt.
After the Jovina Choi kidnapping incident, don't you think that there are sadist people in the world?

There could be someone who has a hobby of framing innocent people."
"If he is caught again with drug, his punishment has to be doubled as he claimed he did not now why the drug was on him. It leave now to the police to investigate why there was a straw of drug on him or whether Spore hospital has another procedural failure."
"Camera?
Finger print?
Investigation?
Urine test?
Handler?
facilitator?
Police report?
External factor?
Look it is suspicious i dont belive."
"Bravo...the Police failed to prove their case. No mentioned that the convicted was a drug addict, had a history of drug trafficking or consumption. And no evidence as to why he was unconscious. The Judge is take a path of extreme caution...what if the drug was planted on the convicted? Well done. Also, it does not need an expensive lawyer to argue an appeal."
"Hello Judge abdul Lah Lah, Did you ask why hospital did not do a drug test on this patient SINGH???"
Rotten substandard reporting. I’m sure the acquittal includes a blood test.
"Dead salted fish can become alive ! Just say prove that the straw of drugs in my crotch is mine ! Next time if he get caught with his pants down in a hotel room with someone's wife, he can say the same thing - prove that I will have sex with that woman !"
"I think for the most part, the key reason for e-cigarettes not being allowed here simply boils down to revenue. Governments including the one here, cant figure out how to put a tax on alternatives such as ‘vaping’ and e-cigarettes. The thought of losing revenue from cigarette taxes outweighs their supposed ‘concern’ for public health. Whatever’s been said about e-cigarettes, it’s been proven that it’s far safer than conventional cigarettes, no matter what’s been said about its long term effects. The fact that the govt don’t know how to make money from it, is the sole reason why it’s ban here."
"Short of a nationwide ban, legalising nicotine replacement technology in Singapore is the way to go, to decrease dependence on cigarettes. There is strong scientific concurrence that vaping is far less harmful to one's health than smoking, even though it is generally accepted that it is best to refrain from using both."
"Any policy changes that result in a significant reduction in tax revenue, hence ministers' salaries, is a straight no no."
"Truth is PAP does not want people to stop smoking. First they can increase revenue from taxes. Second more money will come when people get cancer, making their doctor friends and relatives richer. All the wayang to act like preventing access to cigarettes are just part of the act to reduce supply so that prices can go up. It's like drugs, except that PAP is the legitimate supplier of something which they already know causes cancer but refuses to ban it, but they will ban drugs like weed which does less damage than cigarettes."
This is same reason why battery cars are not common in Singapore.
"Despite what all the studies may show,e-cigs Harm govt revenue."
e cigarettes smoke very nice to see. great !!!!
Whatever our greedy PAP can't make lot of money from you which is illegal .
"E-ciggs has no big major corporations like Pall Mall, British Malayan tobacco etc to push for the legalization of E-ciggs. Instead the government gets money from the tobacco lobbyists to work against E-ciggs so although the govn paints tobacco products as harmful, they have much to gain from taxes and fining smokers."
"Developed countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, South Korea and Japan have documented sharp drops in smoking prevalence, after legalising electronic cigarettes, which other measures have failed to achieve to date."
"why never write about the duties & taxes amount collected ?? -- whether cig or e-cig, thats the smokers problems. -- but if the leegime is concern about non-smokers inhaling '2nd hand' smoke, than the leegime should just legalised e-cig. -- smokers die or not with cig or e-cog, its their problems as long as the leegime save the non-smokers. -- fair ?? -- so, all you non smokers, dont blame the (addicted) smokers, especially the older common folks (not new imported), blame the leegime. -- just stop all import of cig & start with e-cig nation-wide."
"Smoking is supposed to be bad for health for smokers and non-smokers.
Banning E-cigarettes is not justfied ! Why not impose total ban on smoking. However,the lucrative tax revenue does not allow it to happen !"
"Why not ban burning offerings first?
This one even more harm to environment, killing trees and everyone's health.
Anyway, no tax revenue impact & dun think ancestor/spirits want to 'smoke' such big flames yah? Hrr hhrh hr."
"Drug to drug does not make it safer, a false belief of a safer alterbaalte will exist. Why smoke where fresh air is the best gift from nature.

Thinking of smoking, just breathe in and out....enjoys the fresh air..."
Why the law does not protect law-abiding citizens?
"Kudos to Andrew, thanks for speaking up to those who want to find a healthier substitute to quit :)"
I vape when overseas but smoke in Singapore due to not being able to get the vaping liquid
If its untaxable then its illegal. SG logic.
I always wonder if these sorts of articles are written with the help of tobacco lobbyists.
"This disruptive device will put an end to high tabacco taxes, an end to tabacco companies' insane revenues, closing tobacco farms, etc..."
"Don’t listen to the defeatist trash in this article. The best harm reduction comes from banning e-cigarettes, instead of raising more generations of nicotine addicts. Legalizing e-cigarettes will perpetuate the nicotine addiction and extend it for generation after generation."
"How many million of the ""average $32 million healthcare cost"" loss of Asia Pacific region came from Singapore?"
"Everbody knows it cost millions! Tell us singaporean how you going to prevent such occurence. Is the govt training and have a pool of singaporean dealing with this or is outsource or employed foreigners to do it?
Will head roll. If answer is no then no hope. Will happen again. I have no faith."
This is to ensure people have to pay more for goods and services that use cybersecurity measures to prevent cyberattacks !
"first & foremost, before talking about the financial impact, is to grow your twos to named the 'culprit' outright."
Just let the whole world know where the attack came from. From which country will be enough.
Cyberattacks will come fast and furious just like when viruses infiltrated into computers in the past. No cybersecurity can ever stop cyberattacks !
"Remember, this guy is Mr. Won. Not Mr. Win. He probably won only one time at the casino and started thinking he would win in future..."
"What charm does he have, that a girl knowing him for 2 days is willing to loan him money? Please give some tips."
Odd Job Laborer also can find love?! Why many of my non-graduate friends said no Singapore gals want to friend them?
"win won lose or lost... any man u wan to marry need money from you??? run baby run... he cant even feed himself, how to feed his family???"
How did a 26 year old receptionist manage to earn $180k for a man to cheat?
So he is jailed only 25 months instead of the 10 years jail sentence? Why?
"""..They began a romantic relationship that lasted till May 2017. The woman was working as a receptionist then...""

Looks like she only woke up when she's no longer working and cannot support him any more."
"Actually a lot of girls who are unattractive quite easy to get cheated. Even attractive ones, if they really fall in love, really can die for the man."
surname Won? but loose in casino? LoL
"Won has no nationality? 1st time see this surname in the world after been to many countries, companies, clubs, communities.

LOL"
Weakness of love makes her fall into his trap.......MONEY !
Two days into their relationship and transferred money to him? Wow. Must be desperate to get married. Not so smart.
"25 months earn 178k, hmm... not bad"
Why no pic of man ?
She started to give him money throughout the period after TWO days into their relationship?! Can someone tell me is this woman intellectually disabled?
How could she be so gullible ?.......two days into a relationship and she was ready to dish out a few thousand dollars. Ah Won must be very good looking and she fell head long into his arms..sad
"I have learnt never to trust 2 kinds of people: drug addicts and gamblers. Don't need to wait for them to hurt you. As soon as you know they are onto drugs or gambling, run fast and far."
I think the daughter and mother belong to the same kind...
Poor girl
"Two days after meeting, Won asked the woman for $4,000, lying that he was a contractor and needed the money for investment reasons.

Believing Won, the woman transferred $4,000 into his bank account. The next day, Won bought $3,950 worth of chips from the casino at Resorts World Sentosa after withdrawing from the account and gambled the money away.

Won cheated the woman into transferring him money on another 23 occasions in 2015, with sums ranging from $600 to $6,000 each time.

Some time in November 2015, the woman asked her mother for financial help after Won said he needed more money. Her mother agreed and even cashed out her personal insurance policy to help her daughter.

The woman continued transferring money to Won throughout 2016. Her last transaction to Won was on 6 April 2017

========================

what a pity of not revealing her identity, just who is this rich receptionist and her mother ?

I truly love to get to know her as a friend.
I am genuine, sincere, gentle, kind, just that at times I run into some liquidity issue because of my work"
She must have been so desperate to believe a POS like that.
"wow...a receptionist at age 26 already been cheated $180,000. salary very high or parents very rich."
So the final winner is the casino at RWS.
"Dont blame the joker for borrowing so much. After all he must keep up with national income growth. You know, rising cost of living and make believe he is really doing well in our beloved toy city."
Is the girl local
Singaporean woman so good
"no victim here, willing giver and taker"
Some things do not add up in the report. Receptionist - $180000/- 2 days of relationship?
"this lady is white horse. police and court helped to punish the guy. Ordinary people suffering injustice, the police will tell you to do civil suit. NO? go check it out."
"KNN. She got so much money to give this Mr Won-Any-Game. Lady, next time don't be so blinded-with-love lah !!! This is a bloody learning lesson to you. If u think u got so much money, donate to charity better rather then giving men ""easy"" money!! Let me tell you, i was once a big-time playboy and almost become a gigolo (when i was early 20s) but i controlled myself from becoming gigolo. I am now a change person, having a successful career, wife, beautiful daughter . I don't entrapped women to spurn her money on me!!! Im a gentlemen!! I will never take money from women. Nahbeh"
Ten with the rotan. No light ones.
we could never trusted this social media platform
"And the smart 26 years old....? Have she grow up yet? Omg! So now havibg cadinonis good or bad...how many suffers..,one man and 2 women...hello? Now who started this?"
I think if locals who visit to see casino should be refunded $100 for dining or shopping there.maybe wear a colour tag that states vistor only not gamer.
"Won is another Typical oppies showing oppies habit of cheating, gambling(heavily). Poor Girl got cheated by such oppies. BEWARE OF OPPIES. They are very very very good in smooth talk, lying, divert attention, point fingers at others, Gossip others, Fake news creators, and LGBT supporters."
"2 womens lives totally ruined FOR LIFE
A receptionist will have to work another life-long to recoup this amount
And lover boy will be out in 2 years to look for next victim ?

strange for the man in the street to comprehend !!!"
Don't they say they do not need this casino dirty money?.....69% please wake up. LoL
Woman wants LOVE. So Woman must be smart and dont be cheated by Man who want your body and Money and No LOVE in the end.
"Is she mentally challenged, she must be a bit backward poor woman."
"Please stop scolding her . I think she must be feeling real sick now.
I am sure she has learned her lesson."
naive woman
"me too, curious how a 26 yrs old receptionist can earn 180K for the con man to cheat? ...inherited from parent or open legs, haha."
"Goondu Mother and daughter, so easy to get con..."
Ban gambling now!
"Nice lady, wicked man. Wrong combination."
Won doesn’t won after all at casino.
I guess the girlfriend must be a desperado. She is afraid no men will like her that is why only know this guy for 2 days and start to give him money. I guess our police must remove the love scam message back and think of a better one to put up.
This so called Won is lucky to last 2 years..
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is a dou che."
The $100 will not be enough to deter pp. Howeverm for po who jyst want to visit ..they are affected cosvtgey too have to pay ifvtgry want to enter...weird lor
Either the woman is stupid or blind by love or blind by sex
"Far too many mistakes are clearly gross under-performance and failure to fulfil one's responsibility and commitment to carry out the tasked job. The government repeatedly pride itself as exemplery, second to none. Justify your claim and pay."
"This girl is great!
Unlucky to meet a cheater.
Man Love by this woman will be envy of men.
Hope she find true love soon"
"He used the same reason 23 over times to ask for money and the girl gave him every single time - she must have been so blinded but love that she became not foolish but STUPID...of course the idiot bf need to be shot for cheating her...a Chinese saying, lost body and money...sad !!!"
Will this conman Won gets to eat Won Tan Mee in changi chalet ?
Guy is useless but the girl also not better
Booby
"To ALL girls and women out there, can you NOT be so dam stupid??

If your boyfriend starts asking you for money, DUMP HIM !!
Nothing good is going to come out of THAT relationship, for sure.
(and that's putting it very mildly)"
This girl must be a goon than.
Stupidity at its best.
The girl's mother must also be just as naïve and stupid like her daughter!
a fool and her money are soon parted
why is she so stupid?
What do you expect from a ching chong?
Spineless eunuch. Can put him in the Gay ward ?
Haha... she must has got huge boobs
foreign trash
Mother's 老本都赔上了，搞得一塌糊涂，好可怕的果报。So beware of the inter-net.. Get caught that's it.
"This woman give money only after 2 days of courtship? Stupid, ugly and desperate."
This chap Won must've been a 'smooth operator' and the chick? plain dumb
Pussycat itchy... like that also kana cheat and all knows that wechat is a Sex Apps for hunting and hooking...
"Pardon me for missing somehing, but the gal is ultra ultra dumb !!!!!!"
"Sorry, I have to say this is a stupid woman."
Woman so incredibly stupid.
"8 patients died in SGH Hep C incident, and GKY only excused himself and his ministry by saying ""No Blaming Culture"". Lapse after lapse under his million$ watch, he just issue ministerial statement and likely sleep very well at night. Case closed, wait next million$ into his account."
"PAP, why your "" Learn from mistakes "" can never have a full stop ?
Hope there are cases happen to your family before you take it seriously ."
"Gan Kim Yong - worse health minister in SG history . as an world highest paid health minister he make an inexcusable mistake one after one ..... Malaysia RM 6,000 monthly and China RMB 3000 monthly and many other "" low paid "" health minister in this world done much better than him !
VOTE him out to save our health care system and avoid "" unfortunate thing "" happen to you and you family members . ( remember several innocent died due to SGH human error ) .
vote him out vote him out vote him out vote him out vote him out ......"
"Confidential data such as medical records should not be able to retrieve or meddle by anyone including saving the data to thumb drive or even camera. Just like any internet banking today, only the customer can withdraw or deposit the money. For medical records, it should be the same too."
It’s time our Minster take responsibility and step down for the laspes in their ministry.
"Here goes the ‘yes it’s a screw up but it’s not my fault, I’m just the minister in charge and my responsibility is not to take responsibility but to blame administrators and doctors, I’m only responsible when good things happen because unlike all of you I’m an overpaid and under qualified yes man’ position that all of them take when things go bad, just like Mindef, MOE, LTA etc..."
"The million dollar minister must be held accountable for the lapses, please remove him."
So who is taking responsibility for the distress caused?
"when things are going well, ministers will praise themselves and say that they are responsible and well deserving of their million salaries. When things go bad, they will say that others Are to be blame. Wake up singaporeans. By now, everyone should be able to see clearly the tactics of our present leaders and judge for yourselves whether they are really deserving of their pay.."
"Many Singaporeans have committed suicide and many more are ""feeling suicidal"" b'cos of Shameless incompetent ministers like Gan Boh Yong who are Never held accountable for adopting a No Blame culture to escape repeated blunders."
"""Some patients who are affected by the recent HIV data leak have reported to medical social workers about feeling suicidal, said Minister""

Then our govt needs to build a ""Suicide Corner"" near the Tuas Incinerator Plant.

Those HIV people can really contaminate our water if they kill themselves in our river or reservoir. If they jump down from tall building their filthy blood can splash and spread the HIV virus to others.

For public health and safety, best to build a ""Suicide Corner"" near the Tuas Incinerator Plant, so that after they kill themselves they can be incinerated straight away."
One gay doctor and a revengeful American turn the whole country upside down. And Spore is still talking about Total defence when we cannot even cover our backside properly.
Worse health minister getting high salary and performance not up to what we call 1st class city. Why he still sitting there and all fault is not his but lower rank. Is this call good minister we Singaporean like to have in future.
Please step down. thank you
I didn't know that our tax money is used to retain such talent who has 2 security breaches under his watch. hur~hur~ is pap going to change theme and say high salary is to prevent corruption and not retain talent?
"Sorry, feeling suicidal can not sue MOH. No provision for that.

Sorry, committed suicide can not sue MOH. No plaintiff as such since already dieded.

HIV data leak: Some affected patients reportedly 'feeling suicidal', says Gan Kim Yong."
"SingHealth should compensate all the patients for the data leak.instead of suing,as it will take a long time before any settlement can be made ! There is no guarantee that they will win their suits against the authorities !"
"Frank and Honest, you are not fit for the Ministerial Post. Its such a shame guys like you and several other Ministers are still clinging on to your positions without conscience that you absolutely mess up. Trying to explain yourselves out of all these incredible mess only goes to show how irresponsible you guys are."
"The word LEAK which is not an good excuse.
Its totally depend on how you take it seriously regardless of any status.
The systems should also goes thru multiple of trial run before it ensure for implementing.
BTW, Singapore employ for many monkeys FT/FW. Should PAP also need a system to filter and kick out those lousy FT/FW monkey."
"Mr Gan you tell them to sue the gov, how to sue when most of the infected victims are leaving on paycheck to paycheck?"
"In the first place, why is the mentality of Singaporeans so weak?

BECAUSE THE GOV WAS NEVER SERIOUS IN ELEVATING THE COMMON MINDSETS.

It wanted to keep them simple, tow them in line, use fear and control people as a bottom line while letting the rich families prosper. Education was never about changing people society but keeping them in line. This Govt never loved its people.

If it did, it would had spoken more mundane things to the bottom level people to elevate them. But they were rushing to improve the economy without looking back.

If they did, there wouldn't have countless hopeless people, gamblers, directionless people wandering around back in the day who became our parents and continued to fail as parents. All these white we have 1 TRILLION dollars piling up, with less than 5 MILLION PEOPLE.

- They could not even send a spokesman to talk about every mundane things and some essential knowledge on TV.

-------------------------------------------------------------

LKY was a freak when it comes to mental security, he could never overcome it and he did many things becuz of it. Which is why at the end of his life he said,"" Do not immortalize me."" He knew the things he did was not perfect and he saw his immaturity. So he doesn't want to let it continue and be guilty of it.

But LHL and PAP decides to use it and continue to ride on the legacy.

This is the crux at the end of LKY.

The question you have to ask yourselves is this, - What is the point of prosperity if a group of people are mentally weak and stupid?

If you cannot accept this, you people are fked beyond help."
Pay not enough
I only have sympathy for hiv+ patients who contracted the disease thru no fault of their own.
Vote out PAP now!!!!
"Tit for tat?
First and foremost, who leaked Brochez's confidential medical record?
The state media?....erm....the state media?"
"SG has extradition treaty with US.
What take the health minister so long to bring in the white guy?
Should start deducting his salary daily, as long as criminal not brought in.

When criminal in, tell both the gay men clearly that,
any new leak detected, they will get a new lash.
They will only be released 30 years from the last cane."
Under Your Account .
"There was a HR manager that said she would sack her employee if anyone of them appear in that list.

Can we find out who is she and sack her instead and inject her with the virus."
"We've not heard from the American or seen the allegedly 'leaked' list.
The patients should just continue to live their lives normally."
"GKY, grow some balls and resign. So many stupid excuses. If man like you also can keep his job, Singapore will have a irresponsible culture."
"If the ONLY way to remove incapable ministers is by removing the decision maker, then you are leaving Singaporeans w no other choice pinky."
Where is lao goh now
Singapore those lousy ministers..still called themselves first class
Actually is there really a leak? I didnt even come across any leaked list.
This might be blessing in disguise for PAP.....Just send him nut-case counsellor ....rest assured after consulting they will jump down from the building.........well......it could save millions of dollars in damages....
so it happen in 2016 and son of a gan cover it up!
"Encourage the affected to sue MOH and deduced some as suicidal, sounded so uncaring...I don't want this kind of an idiot as MP...vote him out..."
HIV positive patients have been waiting to blame others for their problems. Should pray for miracle to happen and be cured.
He should be demoted and mann the HIV hotline for the rest of his life.
"I am also feeling suicidal; With so many screw ups ,SMRT, National Service ,Data Breach and Hacking ..Yet our leaders just pass on the buck and pretend its no big deal ..I'm feeling suicidal"
I think this guy has one of the best jobs in the world. 2 major screw ups in a roll and he continues to collect his fat pay cheque
"This Pappy has the face of 'bo-chap'ness. No doubt shaped from many, many years of lacking accountability."
Bolting the barn door after the horse has fled...this seems to be what Spore is doing with cyber heists and attacks. How come banks are safeguarding their info? Or the oil companies? We know how 1MDB got leaked (by one person downloading all the email) or how the Panama Papers got published (also by whistleblowers). Why did Spore not learn about those incidents?
HIV is not a death sentence. Research the many alternative and mainstream therapies that will greatly boost the immune system. There is nothing you can do about the past but there is much you can do for your future. One therapy is the use of Urine..called Urine Therapy. It is free (your urine) and there are testimonies about its curative power. No need to fear the future...
"ya, the victim/s if become mad or suicidal just send to IMH n problem solved just so easy"
Shutdown MOH.
"Recently lots of screw up from the minister LTA, military and now MOH must be busy preparing for GE neglecting their main duties. LOL..."
This time we give high pay to those mediocre people
The bill just passed come JIT
"So the TRUTH is at last
EXPOSED to SINGAPOREANS
that

strangely basing on SINGAPORE LAW,

NO LICENSED RED LIGHT DISTRICT WORKER
is ever ALLOWED to be in SINGAPORE

if ever MEDICALLY DETECTED to be
INFECTED with HIV or AIDS

BUT this DELINQUENT and QUESTIONABLE GOVT

ALLOWED 8.800 FOREIGNERS
who are likely to be WHITE COLLARS

or RICH enough to buy Sentosa properties

+ INFECTED with HIV or AIDS !!!!

PM lhl OWNS AN ANSWER to ALL SINGAPOREANS
why the DOUBLE STANDARD !!!"
"Mr Gan you have blood in your hands now, what are you gonna do to those who are affected?"
"Don't play play, this Minister is very serious about his ministerial statements! Every statement he made carries lots of weight! In fact, so much weight that someday MOH would sink under his watch! Lol"
"Jiak liao bee govt got into this mess and only know recommend sueing option, go and sell to more magnimous country to accept them Why bo lum par to help these hiv"
"can singaporeans hold gky responsible, liable for murder ?? -- wait long long la ... the baboon can tokok singsong only, just like female chicken on saf matters."
"FEELING SUICIDAL AFTER CONTACTING HIV and AIDS ?????

Then why is the GOVT
NOT MAKING it A COMPULSORY
EDUCATION MEDIA SESSION
during every PINK DOT
to ALL PARTICIPANTS
on the RISK of LGBT
CONTACTING HIV and AIDS
just like SMOKING ????

Why NOT make it COMPULSORY
for ALL PARTICIPANTS of PINK DOT
to undergo COMPULSORY HIV TESTING
using the HIV MOUTH SWAP TEST ???

It is CHEAP and RESULT AVAILABLE in 20 MINS after TEST !!!

Why is it PARLIAMENT + Chinese News paper
NOT QUESTIONING on why
there are 8,800 FOREIGNERS with HIV and AIDS
ALLOWED in SINGAPORE ????

Even SINGAPORE LAW will NOT ALLOW ANY
LICENSE RED DISTRICT WORKER
to WORK in SINGAPORE
if ANYONE of them
is TEST DETECTED with HIV or AIDS !!!

So is the GOVT BREAKING ANY LAWS
resulting in this
UNNECESSARY FIASCO ?????

Think PM lhl NEEDS to OWN UP if ANY MINISTRIES
have FAILED in ANY WAY
or else EXPLAIN WHY 8,800 FOREIGNERS
are ALLOWED to be in SINGAPORE !!!!"
The victims can feel suicidal thru no fault of their own but how come i dont get any sense of hara-kiri from blundering MOH & MOM ministers?
Get them out from sg?
Ownself direct ownself act.............
gan lao bu as health minister pls go harikiri
Truly a sign of incompetency at the top!
"It's timeky the govt inked a mou with another nation to accept them, put these refugees to a better place"
"唔該啦, say thank you and good bye to people lo"
Simple solution to deport them elsewhere grant them immunity refugees status Such sol also need us to think of govt
"To hell with the 2 LGBT CRIMINALS !!!

Why is it PARLIAMENT + NEWSPAPERS
both English + Chinese

are NOT QUESTIONING the GOVT

in ALLOWING 8,800 FOREIGNERS

who are INFECTED with HIV or AIDS

to RESIDE in SINGAPORE

INSTEAD of DEPORTING them ????????????

NO GUTS ???????

No wonder the newspaper circulation are DROPPING !!!"
"Health Minister Gan Kim Yong stated that the Govt will spare no effort in bringing American Mikhy Farrera Brochez to justice again for his latest crime. Well, if the authorities had done the job properly at the first time of asking, the details of 14,200 HIV-positive people would probably not have been released online by Brochez!"
Is it because he is ang moh?
"Worst Health Minister in the history of Spore. Patient dies, personal data leaked, virus spread, nurse inject wrong dosage, IRON RICE BOWL STILL INTACT ......."
"osa is a serous offence. -- how light sentence can it be, when he was only serving less than 16 months out of 28 months ?? --"
"Gan said that he was sorry, NEH also say sorry...only say sorry..why dont take a bow and resign..."
"If a person's HIV-positive status is confidential, why is the American's HIV-positive status revealed to the public?
Isn't the MOH or some relevant authorities breaking the OSA too?"
"“Brochez was therefore issued with a stern warning for the OSA offence.”
What is this? Stern warning?
Is the reason why he is American, our law enforcement turn lenient?
His case will be better suited ending up with an even heavier sentence, served together with his other offences such as falsification of documents with a clear intent to cheat and cause harm in any capacity the felon deems to justify his agenda.
He was already proven guilty, but was let off lightly."
"I’d hate to say this, but it’s pretty clear that the main reason why he didn’t face jail term or charged is because he’s a white male American, if he’s local, he’d probably face years in jail...locals get harsher sentences from spitting on the sidewalk!"
judgment call to cover up?
"No matter how they explain it, it just does not make sense for witholding the information and the grave mistakes made by MOH."
"Alright.
Who leaked Brochez's sensitive medical information first?....erm....Who?
State media? The govt authorities?"
"He is apologizing for Ler, it’s Ler irresponsible action which caused the suffering. But in the first place why empower Ler the ability to download such sensitive information? You can hand everyone a gun and tempt them to use it and when they use it say it’s their fault"
"please tell us how you intend to help the 5,000 odds Singaporeans inflicted with HIV and what deportation measures you intend to implement on the 8,000 odd foreigners that are still here !"
2 years jail for Ler is too short. He put the data into a dangerous person's hand. He should be jailed 10 years or more.
Gan..step down is the right move..hara kiri is the respect we want from u...please resign with pride.
"This is because in order to charge him under OSA, it will also mean that the one who approved of him getting access to the info's head will roll too. If there is a culprit, and the culprit is not the top, then someone was the one who authorised the access."
"""A stern warning"". Sounds like something a schoolteacher gives an errant child. Uniquely Singapore"
We are part of usa now. No choice. Their influence on us is too great and we accepted it.
"Really a lame excuse. Minister Gan is in hot, hot soup and he was counting on the AG to give him a better explanation to shield his rear end from all the rotten eggs and catapults."
"No blame culture! Can do anything without responsibility. Like the gay doctor, police, ministry of manpower, ministry of health all no need to be responsible."
A leak is a leak. Even to a person who is not suppose to know or have the info.
How many did he infect with his HIV positive blood and semen? We need to know!
"Com'on lah.....if really want to jail him, can wait until his drug offence jail term about to finish then charge him mah, lidat can tambah a few more week and avoid ""concurrent"" jail term. Lidat oso need me to teach chew izzit, ACG? or AGC? (wateva...)

Or, izzit sacred of ah trump huh?"
"So in the end only go inside for 16 months? Some ah pek steal a few million dollars go jail for 20 years. The damage done to these people and their families, if measured in monetary terms, would be in excess if 100 million for sure. Also really disgrace the country.

Lee Hsien Loong and GKY please just go and F yourself. Worse than dogs."
"This is a ridiculous explanation, minister. You charged the person based on the offence you deemed he had committed. Whether the sentence runs concurrently with another sentence or not is for the courts to decide."
"What kind of LOUSY EXCUSE is this?? To charge him under Official Secret Act (OSA) simply means MOH has to reveal WHAT IS THE SECRET he leaked out. HIV Patients data leaked out.....MOH will be ""prosecuted"" by everyone even before the guy is hauled to court. OSA is a lesser charge, so don't charge?? What kind of rationale is that. Since when a convict with string of crimes is charged only for one so call biggest offence. Is Cover Up a crime or just an honest, Integrity issue?"
That's what happen when the head is crooked
Please lah . You know very well who is in charge of US and you have no balls to do so. Admit it! But you can do it to the PM's nephew. Lol. It's OK we understand. Boot is nice...
How come drug-related crimes only 28 months jail? I thought his head would roll? Must act tough like China!
"If he was charged under OSA, then the details would spill out. By not charging him for the data leak, they can keep quiet and think nobody will find out. I smell a rat!"
"Why do you Lowlky Stingkies want to know?
You'd be let known only on a ""Need To Know"" basis.
You are deemed a MORON, and INCAPABLE OF REASONING.
Only Our Elite Ministers and Top Civil Servants HAVE THE BRAIN !!!
Therefore, you Lowlky Stingkies Shuddup!

Now you're let known onto these background reasons because you've made SO MUCH BLAARDY NOISE !!!

[ Despite American Mikhy Farrera Brochez possessing sensitive HIV Registry information, the Attorney-General’s Chambers did not charge him under the Official Secrets Act (OSA) in 2016 as it was deemed that he would likely receive only a fine or at most a few weeks’ jail for his offence.

“This was because there had been no wide dissemination of the information at that stage, and he had primarily used the information to complain to government agencies,” said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong in Parliament on Tuesday (12 February). ]"
"All our patients data have been lost while under his charge....not once.....BUT TWICE!!
Patients have also been infected (and some died) with Hepatitis C under his charge.

Gan deserves to be FIRED!! There's no reason to cover up his incompetence with lame excuses and lose our trust!"
"no need so many excuses, just admit you got no balls to go after angmohlah. if after make so many charges but US demand release of its citizen then lose more face"
"GKY please resign, you are not a people's minister"
"Keep taking in IMMIGRANTS non stop without checking!!
Great keep bringing them in to ignite our FRUSTRATION towards PAP!!
Ground is fuming with methane gases, only election can start ignition!!"
Something very wrong with all the relevant government agenies. So many lapses and he was not even detected. Very disappointed with the government. Someone must be answerable.
The silly Health Minister must resign.
"Fake ,fake , and fake. Cover up and cover up cover up, that it . And you get a good fat Salary."

"If the Ministry and HDB had coordinated in their various fields and planned for more and better housing before opening the door for the foreign influx, there would be sufficient housing for all and at a price that’s affordable for the vast majority of Singaporeans, even if prices do rise albeit at a gradual pace especially for the younger generation who are as at present struggling with their mortgages which they have to pay for an entire life time without the ability to think about retirement and enjoying what’s left of their lives....it’s this failure at doing their respective jobs that caused all this unhappiness on the ground and leave a bitter taste in their mouths whenever the people of this generation think about how they have to pay for the mistakes made by our housing ministers as well as the building authorities......"
wow!! 2 room flat prices are high!!!
"$523,000 for a four-room flat in Kallang-Whampoa!!!!! with minimum sum keep increasing....u think the younger generation will have enough to meet the minimum sum???"

"Without financial support, the most loving couple will still break off. That's life!!"
Its very normal in the USA.
Why no pic of the man and woman ?
Stalker of failed relationship seem likely to be on the rise lately. Something must be done to deter offenders and protect the victims.
what forum are these types of advertisements posted on?
Show Uncle Tay Ling Choon picture please. Just in case another woman becomes his next victim.

"I still do NOT understand why I have to pay ERP twice when i am already IN the city! Just today, i travelled from Kallang to Raffles Place at about 615pm. On nicoll highway just before reaching suntec, i was charged $3! Thats not all! When i reached fullerton, I was charged another $1! WHY DO WE HAVE TO PAY TWICE WHEN WE ARE ALREADY IN THE CITY? Is there a city within a city? Or is this just a way to collect more money from us?"
"They should completely remove the ERP, it is no longer use to regulate traffic, but addition avenue to squeeze money from us."
"The original idea was congestion control of traffic going into the CBD. At the beginning it was car pooling, cars with four people in it enters the CBD free. Those with less people, pay a fee. Daily coupons were purchased before entering into the ""Restricted Zone"". As that require Cisco personnels to watch out at entry points, for the number of passengers and appropriate coupons, it was decided to go electronic so as to free up the manpower needed. Thus the Electronic Gantry was invented. From regulating traffic going into the CBD, it was expanded to congestion control along busy main roads, trunk road, express ways. It was installed in CTE, in PIE, and even for traffic going out of the CBD. It was slowly turned from congestion control into electronic toll collection. Now its hard to tell where the line is between congestion control and toll collection."
"Whoa, pre-election goodie....! Don't be deceived. They grant you this drumstick, they'll easily take back the whole chicken + sides when they increase the GST to 9%, together with other miscellaneous other taxes after the elections...…. Vote the PAP out!"
After election double.
Hmm. ...The problem with LTA. They will not hesitate to erect ERP gantry at location they deem traffic to be heavy but they will never have a gantry right at Hampshire Rd their HQ whereby the traffic there is considered bad .
"Very sneaky headline. When I first read it, I thought they are going to physically ""remove"" the ERP gantry. Alamak, should be titled as temporary ""waiver"" off ERP charges during certain hours only lah. After GE win, then click a few mouse buttons and increase ERP even more & don't even announce in MSM lor.
Hrrr hhrhr hr."
"giving out some 'sweets' trying to divert attention to the many leegime failures & no accountability. -- after the dust settled, be prepared to be taxed & taxed high."
"After election, they will triple the price..."
Why Saturday with Low traffic still have ERP?
What’s the main purpose of ERP? To control traffic flow? Why weekend going to city also must pay when there’s hardly any traffic?
"ERP merely shifts traffic jams from one road or expressway to another. Soon gantries will be all over S'pore. It used to be only in the CBD, but they are now sprouting out on expressways and even minor roads in the HDB heartlands."
Totally agree
"Singapore Govt had quietly allowed the population to increase to 5.6 million without public knowledge and approval . If you reduce the FT and PR Numbers , the traffics will be smoother , there is no need to charge Singaporean’s ERP"
Another Election Tactics. Singaporeans are very smart nowadays. So it should not affect Singaporeans voting habits.
Some elites must be driving pass there everyday…..
I don’t understand one thing: why go home also must pay ERP. Going home must pay is ridiculous!
Maybe because of election. After election the ERP will be increasing mark my word.
Why Bukit timah and why not CTE?
"Till today, why is the govt still collect ERP in the evening on weekdays & weekends ?? Really must be good revenue ."
"the bait has been set, more forginers are treated like god in singapore while locals are like slaves. Must say thank you to your gov for treating forginer like god, you all locals report to your forginer boss now plus each year need to reservice for you local boys."
All Gojek/Grab drivers and taxi-uncles MUST take note of Jovina's preferred route now to avoid another false allegation of kidnapping.
Why not recycle your erP gantries @ the singapore port within tuas since the water declared its our water? Lets see our neighbour will entertain you elites or not
why not take photos of the affected ERP gantries. These would be more helpful. Please put in more efforts in your reporting.
"If our those greedy PAP really want to control car-flow on road in Singapore.
It should control as entitle a unit family without apply COE. where 2nd car on same unit , foreigner will have to bid for COE.
With doing all these, Do you Singapore think it still need ERP ?
BTW, ERP which is a greedy system to dig evryone of our money that's all."
"This is not going to change my mind for the next election. Hope a big wave will occur to wake up those money grabbing elites who have no feeling for the average people struggling to make ends meet. ERP, COE, all other car taxes are zero sum games. Make the elite richer but poorer for the average people."
here come the chicken wing
"Dear LTA, this 3 erp gantries that was removed hardly got any vehicle bypassing... Why don't you remove that gantry along AYE / Clementi Ave 6 & the MCE entrance to central boulevard? Those gantry charged 2 buck per entry and depend on the timing which can go as high as 3 buck."
remove 3 add 10 later
These ERP by right should not be there at the very first place !
"Yeah, election coming so toss a few peanuts to the people."
I'd challenge LTA to remove ALL ERP charges for a month in the whole of Singapore to study the travel patterns.
Soon there will be toll bridge charges at each passing MRT stations. Where do all these funds collected go to? I am sure towards humanity purposes for Singaporeans. ( In my dreams!!)
"Don't go soft sinkies. Wan REAL change? It is pointless and futile talking sense to them now. The last time they 'listened' to anythg was after GE2011 (Minister salary reduced, FT numbers reduced, maid levy reduced etc). After GE2015 became even more arrogant! They need a reminder whose interests are they serving!!"
General Elections are near!
"Assume 100k cars enter CBD evenly by 4 roads A, B, C and D every morning. Erect ERP on A, all 25k join B, C, D. Rev $0. Erect on B, 50k cars now jam up C, D respectively. Rev $0. Erect ERP on C, all 100k cars on D, causing massive jam. Rev $0. To relieve the jam, erect ERP on D. Traffic back to smooth smooth as before ERP.. 25k on A,B,C,D each. Rev = 10x million$ ministers' salary. Effect on road = same as before ERP. Citizen's disposable income = less 1 family outing a month."
LTA should be blamed to erect the gantry. Wasting tax payer money and also whether they really look into it before approved the gantry. Please investigate the department whether any monkey business to erect the gantry. Now again LTA is not performing theirs duty to answer tax payer money.
Election is coming!
"Wow suddenly 3 gantry free but for how long it will be free, you know how much they lost a day for that free gantry, Just what and see how long it will be free, or just wait till the target is fulfil. than it will start again to go up. It a game that play over again and again. Nothing is free with Pay and pay"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAsd1gv4w8o
The ERP gantry on the PIE at Stevens Road towards Changi Airport starts at 7:30 a.m. when traffic is relatively smooth. Is there a need to charge $2? I suggest only commencing the ERP charge from 8:00 a.m.
"Elections coming already and PaPies giving out all these ""goodies"" to get elected. After the election, they will come up with some story and revert back to charging again. Same trick every 5 years!"
"LTA should put ERP gantry after woodlands/Tuas check point, so can collect those Malaysian motorcycles who don't pay parking fees, always by-pass car park barrier, go on pavements and park in motorcycle lot..and enforcer cannot fine them cos did not commit an offence by parking in the lot."
Signs of election soon. The bait is out. All we have to do is open the mouth wide and get hooked to the tini weene bait.
Pre-election goodies? Dun be conned
Removed 3 gantries now and put back 6 gantries after GE
"Remove $1 before GE, after GE increase to $3"
ERP on every lamp post
Elections coming
Wah pretends to listen
"If 3 gone, then 6 coming. Just take note after election."
And reinstalled at twice or triple the charge after winning.
"LTA installed ERP gantries to reduce traffic in the city first, the they came very ""GREEDY"" they installed on ""EXPRESSWAYS"" but LTA promised motorist that more gantries, ROADTAX will be reduced accordingly
MR DIRECTOR, LTA your law changes overnight, all motorist are suffering, you increase COE as you wish, a 200cc motorcycle has to $3900 for COE, please in the entire world, whether in any country a 200cc motorcycle cost S$12000.00
PLEASE WAKE DON'T MAKE US SUFFER"
"They PAP are so smart to think of dirty tactic of ERP for digging our money yet create excuse of control car flow.
Haha, PAP so why not you also create a system of bad attendance from those lazy PAP MP/Minister will not able to collect their Fat Salary ?
Why, Why ? O. your PAP just want to cover and side each others only RIGHT ?
BTW, No way liao. Coming GE2019 all PAP will out of Parliament and do not need any of you to attend Parliament any more."
Say No To Pap.....
Don't worry. PAP will assure to install 10 more ERP after the election.
"At the last Budget it was announced that GST may go to 9% for the next Government to decide. They give you a small sweet now and after elections the GENTRIES may operate on Sundays too. There are gentries after NUH along AYE, and along CTE going home also have to pay. Government says family life important but they charge you if you want to go home early. Please delay your home trip so reduce congestion, and don't need to pay, reach home to have dinner and sleep. They want babies????"
"The westbound PIE at Clementi towards Tuas should be removed.
It's ridiculous that motorists must pay after a hard day's work in the city to go back so close to their home?"
The MCE is so empty during morning hrs and yet charge ERP until today. very slow in response.
"A lot of people are wondering why we have to pay ERP when crossing in either direction of the Singapore River.
Example: Travel along Bayfront Avenue towards Suntec on a Saturday and you get hit by ERP gantry near Marina Bay Sands.
Just look at the LTA map on ERP gantries and you will see gantries on Eu Tong Sen, New Bridge Road, South Bridge Road, Fullerton Road and Bayfront Avenue.
I do not know what is the LTA road pricing policy anymore. You pay to get into CBD and then you pay whenever you cross the Singapore River in either direction. Trigger happy ?"
"They’re trying to bribes us before coming GE, after that what we needs to pay have to pay."
Professional traitors have started their usual dirty-bloody schemes of deceit to attract VOTERS to kow-tow to their low-breed lowlife tactics to WIN VOTES through unjustified means & ways - pui !
"No ERP is bad.
Have some ERP is good.
Have morerer ERP is betterer.
Have ERP everywhere (satellite) is bestest.

Please construct morerer ERP pantries.
Use satellite ERP pantries asap.
Monetise roadway usage, every km of it.
Singapore is a tiny island nation and resources is scarce.
Please understand that Our PAP government has no choice but to do it."
Jovina Choi so powerful???
THANK YOU JOVINA CHOI!
can the lta tell us exactly how many ERP do we have to-date?
"Listen up!

You drive, and your blaarddy vehicle hogs the road thus causing / leads to traffic jam.

You pay for Road Usage, via ERP at the Gantry.

In future, every road pays a stipend to the People whenever your vehicle is on the road.

People = People taking Action to recoup money = People's Action.

You! It's Good For You!

CPL Liu Kai and CPL Aloysius Pang stand guard, warding off evil spirits."
LISTEN LTA...EXCEPT FOR EVENING ERP AT ORCHARD AND TOWN....THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY OTHER ERP CHARGEABLE IN OTHER AREA.....MY VIEW IS THAT THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL TAX BURDEN AND GREAT REVENUE...NOT REGULATING TRAFFIC
"Another G.E. wayang from the m'sian monkey kbh!
Read ""LTA's Quarterly ERP Review"". Now ""remove"" $1 erp. After G.E. the ""Quarterly Review"" will be raised at least 3 times higher to ""Better regulate traffic flow""."
Oh my God! After Elections will kena slap three times. My sore experiences tell me.
Yes. It is time to teach the Monkeys in White a lesson on what the electorate expects from elected leaders. Hooray. Power to the People.
"Some erp so expensive. Standardize them to $1 whole day and everywhere in singapore. Like mps parking lot of one measly amount for 1 day.
Dont be surprise next time all roads leading to a town centre there will be a erp!
To help pay for senior or children activities in the ward."
"ERP charges at three gantries to be removed during peak morning hours.

This is extremely regrettable. Our PAP Government would lose precious tax revenue.

Our PAP Government would lose the monetary budget to spend on social policies to benefit the poor and ages, and would not be able to raise the salary of the President, the Top Civil Servants , the Speaker of Parliament , and last but not least salary of Ministers, whom all as listed are severely underpaid.Is this acceptable? The answer is obvious.

Please Pay Upwards! The Sky is THE limit!

Be Obedient!
Bend down!

"Just one big wayang, after that the big slaughter."
"Something is very wrong with our govt. All the breaches and incidents and accidents are just worded away by ministers, after a COI. There is no accountability! Heads must roll. How can Heng said that we cannot be rolling heads everytime. Why not? When a task resulted in massive losses and lives. how can we brush it aside and quietly sentenced the lowest rank? Policies are made by ministers and CEO and heads. So why should not be accountable? Why should their neck be intact? Sorry is not enuff, minister!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"ERPs do not work to ease jam. Even at peak periods when the charges are at its highest, there are heavy bumper to bumper traffic along CTE. There are already hefty road tax! ERP gantries are merely unsightly and clumsy symbols to remind the people of their blood-sucking ways!"
It's the recent Gojek driver & his female passenger viral video that did this! Good job!
"i was born and live there for almost 40 years

in singapore NOTHING is FREE! when they ""GIVE"" u better be very worried and have sleepless nights cause they will take back 100X"
There’s no rationale to all these. I don’t see other countries deploy so many gantries.
ERP is not traffic management. It is money sucking management.
Is it because she is Chinese?
Oppies complain when ERP is increased and complain when ERP is reduced. Even if gov remove ERP they complain the roads of congestions. Can you believe these half-wits are allowed to vote? If not for the Singapore Constitution those with single digit IQ shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near a polling station.
"PAP now feel our Singaporeans which is not with them anymore.
Now try to remove 3 gantries to fool you Singaporeans and watch are you a stupid Fool again.
Remember, After GE they PAP will put up more ERP and increase another 2 % and make you Singaporeans like a stupid slave again and again.
Its better we Singaporeans change a new Government and have a new system of change. Let our PAP after GE become Opp. Party and its also good for them for understand their mistake.
At least we could have a chance to judge New Government compare to PAP,
and we still do have a 5 yrs and 5 yrs for a better judgement.
Lets forget about the greedy nasty PAP."
"Patch up one small hole here, but another big hole coming up. Wait and see. Lol"
"Should remove/reduce the evening ones at PIE before Stevens and northbound CTE. Motorists avoid those and end up clogging up Lornie Rd, Braddell Rd, Upp Thomson Rd."
The most greedy government in this world with no feelings for its people. Everything is about results from all this scholars so much so that the people are suffering. SMEs are bleeding from GLCs run companies
Election coming...kixk papees out of gov
Another piece of meat ... then you’ll be eaten alive!!!
Erection coming soon....
好戏在后头
Take out the lame ERP at Toa Payoh Neighbourhood entrance... damn stupid!
Singaporean dont be so lame and ignorant! Erp no need to pay UNTIL WHEN OR FOREVER NO NEED TO PAY.
"""As for ruling that prison is warranted for those who defaulted on NS for more than two years, the judge pointed to Mindef's statement delivered by then Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean in Parliament in 2006, to address the public outcry over pianist Melvyn Tan receiving just a $3,000 fine for evading NS.

Having gone to England in 1969 at the age of 12 to study music, Mr Tan did not return for 28 years. He was arrested after returning here in 2005 at the age of 49, as a British citizen, to visit his ageing parents."""
"I got my PCL reconstruction done during NS. I served 2 and half year. The compensation came after I was ROD 5 years to 6 years later.

During the compensation meeting. They only paid 14K plus. The MO said if you appeal will take very long. So do you want to sign and take this compensation amount. This country doesn't care about Singaporean son serving NS at all."
"Parachute in citizen, don't have to worry and get job without disruption…we have to subject to such rigid rules to keep SIngapore safe…"
"Meanwhile many new citizens enjoy a free ride - no NS, no reservist obligations."
"Govt should be fair and release all the ministers sons and nephew records to the public showing whether They had served the NS duties
including the reservists duties"
"""....In September last year, Minister for Defence Ng Eng Hen said that over the last 10 years, there have been an average of 350 NS defaulters each year....""

As usual, Ah Hen only gave half the story. In reality and the complete picture is that over the past 10 years, an average 22,000 new citizens EACH year are allowed to thwank NS obligation. What is 350 locals defaulting on NS when 22,000 new citizens are having a free ride?"
"Young singaporean are forced to perform and serve national duties for 2 years NSF and 10 year reservists duties and getting peanut salary in return,

And yet Singaporeans have to buy private , resales houses and
Car at expensive prices, prices that are the same with the PR.
And yet jobs are open equally between Singapore and PR

All these are with the conditions that Singaporeans must perform 12 years national duties and PR is totally not required .
What do Singaporeans serve national service for ?"
"Dude, no choice lah....who ask u to be a Singaporean? U should take up other citizenship and come back as a foreigner, then apply for PR then u can siam NS."
"7 weeks jail better than died during training. But after jail term, still have to serve?"
"This guy evaded NS for 3 years for personal reasons, given jail time - no excuse.

A president 's son evaded NS for 12 years to pursue personal interests, no jail time - what is the excuse?

Double standards from the Ownself Declared Ownself Not Corrupt/Full of Integrity? Or better known as the White Horse Advantage?"
"P@P govt must be very proud that we have an army of defaulters. All scared if book into army camp, they will not make it out alive. How to serve NS with pride & confidence?"

"To Everyone in this Website, Especially PAP, Opposition Parties & All Singaporean,

TREAT the Death of our soldiers as Dead Stray Dogs & Dead Stray Cats that we sometime found on the Street and DON’T FEEL PAINFUL of it . . .

This is what is described in Chinese words of such mindsets :==>>

死的是别人的儿子 ，又不是自己亲人 ，当然不心疼呀 。。。当做是死了野狗和野猫在街上就是了 。。。

From this website that mention of an NSF personnel evade National Service, due to afraid of having heard “ stories about national service “ & afraid of sustaining injuries, which is well supported by the recent BAD NEWS on Death of NSman & NSF personnel in SAF & Civil Serice that seem to be cause by ABUSE of POWER & ACTS of IRRESPONSIBILITY by their bad officers & irresponsible comrades, it has EXPOSE OUT these BIG PROBLEMS in SAF, Civil Defence & many government agencies . . .

It like even if many thousands of Singaporean have died senselessly & terribly , it is also very, very, very OK at all, by certain people that held important positions in Singapore . . .

Seem to want to INTENTIONALLY & PURPOSELY to IGNORE the whole Big Problems & Sweep the whole Big Problems under carpet again & go on with life, as though nothing has happened & life goes on as usual ! ! !

Is that how our “ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ should behave ? ? ?

It really give us an impression that many Key Civil Servants in Singapore Civil Service , which is regarded internationally as the “ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WORLD “ , are more interested in to EARN the FREE & EASY HIGH SALARIES & also, EARN the FREE & EASY , SWEET-OFF COMFORTABLE LIFE in their WORK PLACES than truly want to work hard & swear hard to serve the people . . . . , ADDICT to COMFORT ZONE & refuse to come out from such EASY-GOING LIFE at all .

Really set a very BAD EXAMPLE to Singaporean people & the whole world , if that is the case , & very WORST , seem to INTENTIONALLY & PURPOSELY do that too . . .

Something is terribly WRONG with the “ DEEP-ROOTED CORPORATE CULTURE “ & “ DEEP-ROOTED SOCIAL CULTURE “ in our “ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WORLD “, which seem to have gone wrong for many years, BUT , seem to Purposely IGNORE by our“ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WORLD “ over many years . . .

OR, should say , simply REFUSE to even take action to prevent such tragedies from happening, like set up special , powerful , completely independent military law enforcement agencies to deal with such problems , in which ordinary low level law enforcement officers are often unable or even too scare to handle . . .

[ Such agencies worked LIKE the American version of JAG or CPIB / CID in the Singapore Arm Forces & SCDF , to investigate POTENTIAL MURDER , ATTEMPT MURDER , ABUSE of POWER , PULLING RANKS , CORRUPTION , POWER PLAY , CHEATING , EMPLOYERS any how SACK NSmen from their jobs for their NS Training , or intentionally DISCRIMINATE NSmen in their jobs for their obligation to NS & etc. .

Very IMPORTANTLY , We need such very Specially trained, very Professionally Committed , very Ethically Upright Law Enforcement Agencies that literally behave like Real Justice Bao / 包青天 & are absolutely FREE from all Political Influences & External Pressures from self-interest groups to deal with such very cunning , bad people , BUT , BUT , so far, there is very few such people exist in SAF or any where in Singapore yet ]

Really need more “ FIREMAN “ type of Ministers, like Dr Khaw Boon Wah & even Mr Shanmugan, to CLEAN UP , make full HOUSE CLEANING ( Chinese mean : 清理门户 ) & RESTRUCTURE all the MESS that have happened in our“ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ & even Private Sector , BUT , need still quite reliable Non-PAP political leaders, like Mr Mr Low Thia Khiang & now, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, & also NEUTRAL Singapore Judiciary System to MONITOR & CONTROL the action & behaviour of Top Civil Servants, to press such cases to happen . . .

Don't you ALL in this WEBSITE THINK so ? ? ?

Any COMMENTS from you PEOPLE out there ? ? ?"
How to fight for our Country??? When our Government shutdown on us???
"It used to be meaningful to serve NS as we were protecting our country and true blue Singaporeans. Now with so many NEW citizen from so many other nations, count me OUT. Truth is that many need not serve NS after converting to NEW citizens..."
I met a British man whose son was born in Singapore. When his son went to visit where he had been born as an adult he was given his call up papers at the immigration desk! The date of his reporting for national service was the day he was booked out to leave so he left. Does this ruling mean that if he goes back to Singapore he is likely to be jailed?
"If jailed 7 weeks no need to do NS......OK what.
NS is a waste of time. No one wants to fight for PAP. PAP prioritize foreigners, so why should Sgreans serve NS?"
Should be voluntary due to recent no’s of death that can be avoided.
"To Everyone in this Website, Especially PAP, Opposition Parties & All Singaporean,

National Service need to ABOLISH because our situation is no longer like in 1960s and 1970s any more & also, IMPORTANTLY, Cold War had already ended for over 20 years .

From this Unhappy Event on Evasion of National Service by a Singaporean man due to WORRY of having heard “stories about national service”, & afraid of sustaining Injuries, which have rather WELL-FOUNDED GROUNDS, due to recent senseless Death of NSman & NSF personnel in SAF & Civil Service, it has EXPOSE OUT these BIG PROBLEMS with National Service, which our “ MOST EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ has IGNORE & seem to purposely DON’T CARE for Singaporean people so many years . . .

Also, IMPORTANTLY, to ensure that we have a better SAF to protect our nation , our National Service-based SAF is to be REPLACE fully by a much more Efficient , much more committed FULL - TIME PROFESSIONAL ARM FORCES , just like other more advance countries , like USA , Australia , Japan , France , UK & etc. .

* * * NOTE :==> We are in the Age of Globalization that can be brought about only by both peaceful & stable environment , in which large full scale wars , like Gulf War & World War 3 , have little possibility of happening , despite that smaller scale military conflicts still can happen . . .

Also, WORST , In the Age of Globalization , Goods , People , Information , Trades & Business Opportunities can travel very fast around the world & it also means that our JOBS & our BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES can LOSE to oversea easily & fast too . . .

When our Jobs & Business Opportunities have been LOST due to National Service is our “ MOST EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ are going to HELP all of us to get back for our LOST Jobs , LOST Business Opportunities & LOSS in our INCOME for our Family & Marriage . . . . . . . . . . . . . .? ? ? The ANSWER is definitely NO . . .

This is for the sake of the FUTURE OF our young people & the SAFETY of our young people , Especially purposely caused by bad officers, or evil comrades in the SAF or SCDF & also, being intentionally DISCRIMINATE in work places by their employers that often lead to JOB LOSSES by the NSmen . . .

This is especially so BECAUSE for so many years, our Millionaire Top PAP Ministers are UNABLE to prevent death & tragedies happened in National Service & PROTECT the Job Security of our sons that go for National Service training . . .

OR, should say , simply REFUSE to even take action to prevent such tragedies from happening, like set up special , powerful , completely independent military law enforcement agencies to deal with such problems , in which ordinary low level law enforcement officers are often unable or even too scare to handle . . .

[ Such agencies worked LIKE the American version of JAG or CPIB / CID in the Singapore Arm Forces & SCDF , to investigate POTENTIAL MURDER , ATTEMPT MURDER , ABUSE of POWER , PULLING RANKS , CORRUPTION , POWER PLAY , CHEATING , EMPLOYERS any how SACK NSmen from their jobs for their NS Training , or intentionally DISCRIMINATE NSmen in their jobs for their obligation to NS & etc. .

Very IMPORTANTLY , We need such very Specially trained, very Professionally Committed , very Ethically Upright Law Enforcement Agencies that literally behave like Real Justice Bao / 包青天 & are absolutely FREE from all Political Influences & External Pressures from self-interest groups to deal with such very cunning , bad people , BUT , BUT , so far, there is very few such people exist in SAF or any where in Singapore yet ] .

Very WORST, those MILLIONAIRE PAP top ministers still want Singaporean to have more babies ! ! ! ! !

[ Who on Earth will want to have babies to be send to be CRUELLY KILLED in National Service when the babies have grown up ! ! ! ! !

Perhaps, this also explain PARTLY why Singaporean population have FEWER BABIES . . . ]

Since our “ MOST EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ never really want to SOLVE these PROBLEMS that have been going on for many years, or should say PURPOSELY IGNORE . . . . . . . , then WORST come to WORST, Singaporean people really have NO CHOICE, but to DEMAND the National Service to ABOLISH , as the ONLY WAY & really seem to be the ONLY WAY exist . . . , to PROTECT the lives of our sons & to PROTECT the FUTURE of Singaporean men .

I think if those millionaire top PAP leaders refuse to ABOLISH NATIONAL SERVICE due to all types of High-minded, beautiful ideas that have nothing to do with the Safety & Well-being of our children, we should get HELP from Opposition Parties instead . . .

Any Opposition Parties that willing to FIGHT for Singaporean to completely ABOLISH the National Service, we should look into VOTE them in Coming General Election , or any other By-Election . . .

Don't you ALL in this Website THINK so ? ? ?

"“Suffering from “medical issues” and having heard “stories about national service”, Cheng was afraid of sustaining injuries,...”
“To err is HUMAN but to forgive is DIVINE” - got it, THINK... and ponder ... It was mere FEAR that drove him to DO what he DID impulsively - SOooooo, why stress him up further to go after his back like he has committed a great crime - when he had honestly expressed HIS FEARS that confronted him and made him to have NO confidence to perform NS FOR FEAR of losing his LIFE unworthily for no valid reasons even as - SOooooo, many of our precious SINGAPORE SONS PERISHED undeservingly & unjustly as CHEAP SLAVES without care & protection over their LIFE & WELL-BEING by the so-called heartless slave-driver yaya-papaya AUTHORITY - who have treated our dignified SINGAPORE SONS without due respect & care they aught to have received and 100% deserve it so - as they are other peoples’ PRECIOUS SONS highly priced & valuable to their parents & family, period !"
7 weeks for 3 years. Not too bad
white horse many pattern...no jail
all the leegime baboons in parliament should report whether their sons serving or served NS or not. -- lead by examples.
"New convert citizens need not worry, this is for true blue Sgaporean"
"I was looking forward to my NS, seriously. After 12 years of education, I was really wanting to join the army to see some action...... and then they made me a clerk !!!"
NS = No Safety ?
"Article very suspicious and not factual correct, I think. How can the parents claim don’t know and he has the ability to travel to Australia and get a degree there? No need $ ar.....his defence on scare and medical, seems so fake to me. Seems like an intelligent case of “Chao Geng”"
"Quote : """".In September last year, Minister for Defence Ng Eng Hen said that over the last 10 years, there have been an average of 350 NS defaulters each year.""""

KNN, went awol for more than 3 years yet jailed for only 7 weeks. Its no wonder Ah Hen said Singapore has got an average of 350 NS decaulters yearly over the past 10 years, despite it small population and the tiny number of males reaching NS age."
Should charge those who fund him the ticket .
"He scare choose to AWOL. Lots of Malaysians not scare but DO NOT serve yet can BE MINISTERS>>!! Now the CB mouth Puthucheary TCSS, saying he served SG NS by serving in KK!!
When Indian talks, better analyze their INTENTION. Indian Traitor can be President, Indian can Pretend as Malay and B President!!"
What the use of having National Service when the SAF unable to wage war against Malaysia Malays government and protect Singapore against Malaysia incursion
"At the age of 18, he had money to holiday in Brunei and then fly to Australia to stay for many years to study for a degree?
This is an AH SIA KIA.
Very rich, spoiled rotten and self indulgent.
In his case, very cowardly too.
A worthless individual.
Male Singapore citizens should be proud to serve to protect their country.
What is wrong with this CREEP?"
"Jail, then serve NS. Hope his future employers dont take it against him as he has made good. Now, MIW must make sure new citizens and FT do NS too right ?"
"If most of us Singaporean men who served NS judge our NS system only on the surface and be awash with all these sentiments, I would feel and sympathise with most (I ROD’ed and ORD’ed), but there are more than meets the eyes if we delve deeper and realise the different facets of it.
1) Our country is going into phrase of aging population and our rate of childbirth is inadequate in the cycle.
2)If our country needs specialty professionals, talents and experts in small/rare/new industries, mandatory NS for foreign mature men applying for PR likely deters them.
3)It is inappropriate to enlist men who are over prime age.
4)We who are born Singaporeans serve to defend our country, even though the sense of belonging has likely dipped, but we will protect our family and those who we love nonetheless. It makes me cringe when we speak like we need foreigners to protect our country, and many whom hearts may not stay here for long.
5)Young males of foreign origins have to serve NS to obtain citizenship.
There are probably more, yet I will resent the perceived ""free ride for foreigners"" either, but it is good to know and see in a fuller and thorough perspective."
haha..must have heard of so many NS men deaths? LoL
"It's long overdue that NS should be abolished donkey yrs ago. Stupid Singaporeans brain washed still said good, young and old alike. A rented China missile from Johor will finish Singapore once and for all. Too many ns boys died and LHL, Ng Eng Han couldn't be bothered! 70% voters for PAP and hopefully the % will increase in coming election. SO more sg and new citizens will suffer. Old new citizens complaining, serve them right!!! happy to know"
"I don't know if it is me alone. I feel certain countries like the Japanese, China Chinese, Koreans, Thais, Americans, Australians, Europeans from all European countries have reasons to be proud and a sense of belonging. A pride that make them feel belonged. Their pledges or songs of love for their countries real. Sadly, I don't feel such for my own country Singapore. I like the convenience, many of the systems. I don't dislike Singapore yet, there is no love for it. I feel that everyone can come here and be a Singaporean or resident. Like it not worth very much. Don't understand myself. Wonder if there are Singaporeans that feel this way?"
Only 7 weeks jail?? That’s a good trade off for having to serve almost 3 years of national service.
"Why doesn't Yahoo ever write an article on how president's son can thwank NS for 12 years? Show everyone the complete timeline of his ""activities"" from age 18 till 30. It is good to educate us on how exceptionally gifted or exceptionally ""vital to SG survival"" a person must be to enjoy 12 years of NS deferment. Or basically he is just an exceptional White Horse? (His father being the Minister of Defense at that time)"
Why army camps got ghosts ? Why so scare ???
"aiya, mostly born in the 90s are gu niang... period~~~"
"cannot blame him led a sheltered life , lots of NS man are either limping or injured doing BMT period"
Oppies in action again. Worthless oppies.
Oppies only want money...….aka TCB go for president pay.
He scared of NEH?
"If given a choice, i believe many many S'pore male citizens wouldn't want to serve NS too. NS sucks, SAF sucks."
Look. Just look at the Hydrogen bomb. One drop n detonated over above us will see almost all of us in heaven let alone soldiers fkght
Nothing wrong serving NS is serving pap and Fts.
"Hen said that over the last 10 years, there have been an average of 350 NS defaulters each year. ------------------- if this is meant to highlight the 'extent', then the female chicken should seriously ask himself, why ???"
"I am not so annoyed/offended by people evading NS. Until now, SAF have not been able to enlighten us on any suitable preventive measures in order to protect the people to be assigned to do the repair left behind by AP in New Zealand? My perception/recommendation is to have that repair done in the workshop, not in the field, as we may not have the expertise/facilities to do it in the field."
This dude knew what he was doing lah. He weighed the risk and accepted the light sentence on top of serving his 2 years. He studied got his degree and most likely secured a good job overseas.
"""....In September last year, Minister for Defence Ng Eng Hen said that over the last 10 years, there have been an average of 350 NS defaulters each year.....""

So president's son thwanked for 12 years, meaning he was one of the 350 for each of those 10 years, and more too. Must be most outstanding White Horse to date."
"Talking so much is useless. If you don't like his administration, Singaporeans, please vote him out of parliament. They are so thick skin.Anything and everything have happened but they don't step down."
"Suffering from “medical issues” can down PES one le. come to worst is C9L9. at camp do nothing also. siao. they friend tell him the scary side only. now 7 weeks of jail, i think will also kena DB."
"SAFRA/HomeTeamsNS should help those who served NS+Reservists Trgs to find quality jobs since WDA/NTUC/E2i are a little busy helping both Singaporeans and PRs too.

Pay membership fees for so many years just to get a watch?

LOL"
"Dont ever vote for the puppies...
they cant even handle a 95 yr old man..."
If you got connection you can be excused from NS for 10 years. For staying away for 3 years kana jail and have a criminal record.
"Unless you can run away forever, please go and serve lah!

Now you have to declare your Jail Sentence in your Job Application Form if you want to be honest.

What a joke?"
I wonder beside tony son is there any other mp sons or satutory leaders escape NS. Should ask Mr Pereira to ask defence minister. Singaporean are curious lot. Its better to come clean.
I wont view Cheng as a traitor
7weeks bet hes thinking happy days
get em in
"This is too lenient and unfair for the rest of the obedient citizens. He should be given at least one lash for each month of default. In the old days, his head would have been chopped off."
"He should not be jailed, he seemed to have a valid reason."
why serve NS? It is so easy for china/india folks to get citizenship.
"Usually those chao keng oppies who contribute very little during NS and reservist trumpet their “extreme sacrifices” and “courageous acts”, act Old Bird and want to be compensated even for a paper cut. Those who serve well do so quietly and gallantly, no need big hoohaa."
Pity we do not have compulsory NS in the UK any more. Just imagine all of those knife wielding druggies/pushers crying for their mammy's when the drill sargeant shouts at them.
They don't seem to make reservists do any time if they are high earners
"NS, fines and caning is for Singaporeans, job scholarships, job opportunities and citizenship to help pap win the next election is for foreigners"
why you so kayu.
"OMG the pretentious oppies ... copycat talk tax like Americans as if they pay not hundreds, not thousands, but millions in taxes to gov per year. Always those who pays the least complains the most and wants the most freebies. Focus on paying up your $5 per month GIRO lah."
Pay these NS guys a decently allowance and people will not be so grumpy
"NSmen are the country's ""Forgotten Generation"""
Zaley!!
Jailed for refusing to accept that the Singaporean government has a right to enslave him. £uck Singapore.
Lefty coward
you want to act like world class but in the end you only taking the people as fools
"""It will also expand the definition of rape to include both non-consensual penile-anal and penile-oral penetration.""

Great !
Now farc king GAY can be charged for raping our sons, 20 years jail, 24 strokes of caning."
"suicide / homeless / depression of men is all viewed as illegal. 5 million people you want to take care as if you have 5 billion. Please la, go fk your stupidity and stop acting like capable. knn lj stupld."
So guys better watch out!. Before you wanna have have sex with your spouse better seek her permission first. Otherwise it may amount to rape! Very sure some will want to pay and forget about getting married!.
And they cannot even secure electronic clearance at Malaysia checkpoints for Singaporeans travelling by foot whereas Malaysians coming in and out of Singapore by foot have been using automatic clearance lanes at Woodlands and Tuas.
"Huh? Really ah? YAY......

But i can't even afford a passport due to jobless. How huh, ah LEE?"
Big deal. Last check it is still a big hassle for us just to cross over the causeway. 'Powerful' passport indeed.
So that helps to improve Sungaporean lives?
"So what... you'll ONLY be able to get to use electronic clearance if you PAY, so for most of us, holidaymakers we'll still need to queue!!!"
Travel is free of charge ? Especially when tax and fines are so high
With trips sponsored courtesy of our gahmen just to experience these expedited immigration policy...
We are a trusted and respected nation. We are not like the Boleh Land.
those who are eligible better migrate.
Remember the tragedy of Aloysius.
Australia already have automated immigration clearance for S'pore passports
"well, NZ will soon get the million chinamen (new citizen) invading the country."
"i 10 years never travel liao ..ok lah, tomorrow i make one passport and plan to visit NZ. don't say i don't give face"
"Spend 11 hours on a plane to see country sides, mountains, and maybe encounter earthquakes and typhoons? Besides smelling all those sheep dung?"
"No thanks. Can count sheep on my bed already. No need to go there.

LOL"
"There are many cases that we did not filed any complaints. It has happened to me many times, but I did not and I believe many like me did not filed any complaints."
Just look at the Long queue at their office daily to collect undelivered registered letters and parcels.
"""SingPost received 91 complaints about misdelivered and lost mail in 2018: Sim Ann"" -- now then you know? KNN - has been going on since 2011."
"We have a such a fantastic reactive government, only react when there are public outcry. Once every five come out to distribute carrot and make empty promises. If Singapore is a company, it would fail miserable and stockholder will be asking for a change of CEO."
"Then remove the CEO and the poor management. No use just fining it when it is precisely abusing its monopoly to ignore those complaints which many are sure involves more than just 91 given so many online airing of grievances recently. And really, besides Singpost, who has heard of the other mystical 3?"
timely delivery has not been its KPI but its profit is more important.
bonus not enough so must fine more
"I keep receiving letters from units above, below & next door to my apartment in a relatively small private development. Postmen these days take no pride in their work."
"ONLY 91 ???
Including those rejected over the counters or phone calls or not?"
"Why they always deliver other pple letters to me?

I am not going to pay their bills for them siah!

LOL"
91 complaints only???? What a sham. That's a lie.
"Some time in March 2017, I received some letters from several organisations, all of which dated either December 2016 or January 2017. One of the letters contained shopping vouchers, another contained cheque from the insurer, all of which I was expecting. I complained to the organisations when I did not receive the said vouchers and cheque. Little did I suspect that it was our ""well trusted reliable"" postal system that was failing. It was only when I received all the said letters together one day in March 2017, that I realised that it could not be the several organisations' fault, all at the same time.
I tried to give the feedback to Singpost, but could not find any contact or email address for posting such feedback. I brought the case to the attention of the post office at Bras Basah Complex. The staff member who handled my complaint took the original envelopes and copies of those letters that were delivered 3 or more months late. The case rested in peace after that. Besides this, I have encountered many incidents of neighbours' letters wrongly put into my letter box as well as an unpleasant case of a postal office questioning why there is no address given on the message that Singpost sent to me regarding redirection of my registered article. Huh? the message was sent by Singpost, she should asked her employer why there is no recipient's address in the message but I think it may well be correct to not include address for security reason?"
"For every official complaint, there are scores more instances of lost mail that went unreported or when the intended recipients never even knew that their mail went missing."
Singaporean LPPL.....
"i had at least 5 lost mails within less than half a year and I don't even get much mail, around 10 mail orders, so thats a HIGH AMOUNT!!! Seriously 91 complaints only????"
What happen to all ours Ministers running Singapore. We dare to call 1st class city and yet performance rate going down. Salary still not enough and yet demand for more.
"My complaint is the heaps of unsolicited advertisement flyers that become lodged in my mail box every day. It is killing the trees and wasting my time having to sort them out into the trash bin.

If SingPost insist on commercially exploiting this monopoly to use our mail boxes as a business platform, they should pay a monthly fee of $30 per household - not to the Government but to the residents who are being inconvenienced."
I always felt cheated every year when I received bill from my insurance company to pay my annual premium within the next few days while the bill is dated as early as 2 week back!! Now I know it's probably not their fault to make me rush.
having to pay all these CEO millions a year just sitting there....
Duh. 'Mail-related complaints'. Of course la. Then what? Food-related ?
"SMRT always increase fare when service quality is below the standard. Singpost should do the same for stamp prices and delivery services, the customers will also lan lan. hur~hur~"
"91 complaints is not high considering half of the complaints are probably from people who complain about everything, and 1/3 are from people who are just confused."
Sack the minister concerned for under-delivered of services. Give SingPost a nice building and services lapsed. Building could have put to better use.
I did not registered my complain as no one attend my calls.
"The actual number of customer complaints should be much higher because not all angry customers write in to complain. Some would call the call center, and some would give up calling because they can't get through. There are others who hate hearing an incomprehensible Indian voice and hang up. When ""SingPost was unable to give a specific number of complaints that it had received,"" it implies that they are either too embarassed to report the high number of complaints or does not have a proper complaint management system or both."
"I sent my parcel overseas through SingPost. Recipient never get to receive the item. LIVE CHAT said not their problem, they had completed their task, the parcel was forward to their overseas partner. I must check with them myself or i may file in the request form. So basically, i could not even make a lost parcel claim. The overseas partner website indicated that item was not trackable. USPS Tracking® is unavailable for this product for SINGAPORE. Very frustrating.. irresponsible Poster service."
"They are too busy converting Post offices into restaurants and shopping mall to collect rental, no time to care for postal service."

"Singpost ""used to be"" operating very well in the past. It paid GREAT dividends quarterly totalling about 6% annually. Under the present management investors can't even 3%! That's why Singpost shares fall from a high of $1.60/per share to as low as $0.90."

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1075318/singapore-couple-convicted-of-abusing-maid-who-was-ordered-to-pour-hot-water-on-herself"
Kudos to the whistle blowing salon employee!
By appealing against their sentences would clearly indicated that they don't even feel guilty and remorse for all the physical harm they had been abusing to a poor soul. Any wise judge sitting for this appealing case should increase their original sentences.
Please give more detail. Boycott the salon and the designer company!
"This couple Linda Seah & Lim Toon Len deserve to have their respective sentences doubled after their appeal. If they wish to behave like beasts, they should be locked up for a long time & treated like animals."
"Quote : """"..The couple, who have a five-year-old daughter, were found guilty last month following a 15-day trial. Both are currently out on bail of $15,000 and $5,000 respectively, pending appeals against their convictions and sentences."""".

If our appeal judge is human enough, and is not a supporter of maid torture, he or she should increase the jail term and fine for both the animal husband and his vicious wife, to return more justice to the poor maid."
"Seah, a beauty salon manager, was also ordered to pay the maid a total of $11,800 in compensation or spend another six weeks behind bars.

Her husband, 44-year-old interior designer Lim Toon Leng, was jailed six weeks on one similar charge. Lim is a director and shareholder with Seah’s salon.

Both are currently out on bail of $15,000 and $5,000 respectively, pending appeals against their convictions and sentences.
======================

They own a salon in Orchard,
quite likely
this couple may forego the 20k bail, jump bail and hide in Thailand"
"Show photos of this Lassie.

."
"come on there many many other maids getting ill treated, they either scared to complain or used to it, look at majority sporeans, all attitude like babi, maids sure kan from the kids too."
"Look at the way the maid was being tortured, is this couple really human being? The sentence is considered very lenient already!"
"Great, justice is done. However, Singaporeans have to ask why so many of us are so inhuman?"
"TIME FOR PAP TO STEP DOWN IN POWER......

"Quote : """"..Seah, a beauty salon manager, was also ordered to pay the maid a total of $11,800 in compensation or spend another six weeks behind bars.""""

Its good that the court has ordered this animal couple to compensate the maid even though heal the tremendous injuries this animal couple had inflicted onto the maid, but at least that's something she can bring home to her family.

The court should not just allow the compensation to be converted to ONLY 6 WEEKS JAIL TERM if the couple cannot pay.
They should be made to sell off their salon business or other assets which I am sure they have, to find the money to compensate the maid, even getting it from their CPF account.

Else, if the compensation is allowed to be converted to just a stupid 6 weeks' jailed term, which will be cut to only 4 weeks in the end, the maid is going to get nothing to bring home, only the psychological and physical injuries and wound to her heart."
She will also be drinking tainted water during her jail term.
Women should be cane too

"they look like a nice couple but so sad that they behave so badly toward any human being, change the helper if you find them not suitable, no need to abuse them."
THESE ARE THE REAL LIVE MONSTERS OF SINGAPORE
"There are many people around us who are wolves clothed in sheep's skin. These people sold their souls to the devil for wealth and riches so that they can enjoy life. They have no respect for human kind, they are very selfish and derive happiness by tormenting others who are at their mercy. Money and power to them is everything they ever care for. I thank God that they are the exception rather than the norm."
"This is one of the worst cases of maid abuse. Not only was the maid not paid her salaries, she was deprived of food and sleep and abused. How such employers can treat their maids in such manner is really unconscionable. The woman should be in jail for a long long time."
"The couple should be executed. People like this are evil and fines and jail time won't change them, so it is best to remove them."
"Seah still has the nerve to appeal her sentence.
Unbelievable!"
"This pair must be from the 70%. They inherited the ""legacy"" of their masters of being ARROGANT and think that they can do anything they like since they are IN POWER!"
"""Seah, a beauty salon manager, was also ordered to pay the maid a total of $11,800 in compensation or spend another six weeks behind bars. ""
Why should the compensation be tied in to the additional 6 weeks. Poor victim gets nothing if the monsters choose to continue with their holiday in Changi. After all it's only a matter of 4-6 weeks. They may do this out of spite. A more deterrent sentence should be imposed if they fail to compensate!"
Should boycott that Lim Too Lann's Sky Living ID
This different breed of idiots should not be given any privileges in life. They will only used it to harm others while benefiting from it all. Incarcerate them indefinitely as they are a menace to society.
Jail both for 20 years. Lowlifes and pieces of S&%it. Boycott their businesses!
"Clearly certain people cannot employ domestic workers. The worker end up as slaves or worst.
The whole deal with hiring a domestic worker is highly disadvantageous to the worker."

I would like to hear from the bigwigs at MOM, unless of course they are a bunch of COWARDS."

hi
What about those maids who killed/abused the elderly and children placed under their care? Only one to two years jail term after psychiatric assessment by our useless judiciary?
These 2 cheebyes must be punished severely. Kpnnbccb
ARE THIS BLOODY BARBARIOUS COUPLE HUMAN BEINGS IN THE FIRST PLACE ??? COS I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW CAN A HUMAN BEING CARRY OUT SUCH VICIOUS ATTACTS AND TORTURE ON ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. WHAT KIND OF AN EXAMPLE THIS ANIMAL COUPLE IS TRYING TO IMPRESS ONTO THEIR DAUGHTER.?? THEY ARE NOT FIT TO HAVE CHILDREN
how i wish the Judges would allow the maid to pour boiling water or the couples body...first semi naked...and pour the boiling water from the back neck to feet...no.2 ....daily cleaning foods water...mixes with tainted let them drinking few bottles per days...no.3 let the maid practice punching on their faces and heads. I REALLY WISH THISCOULD BE THE NEW RULES ALLOW FOR EMPLOYERS HITTING THE MAIDS.
Even ex imh patient also dont behave like a beast.

"How about getting India and Bangla university professors to mark our papers?
Cheaperer is Betterer, after all.

In response to MPs who called for written scripts to be marked locally, Ong said that a very substantial amount of “highly qualified resources” would be needed to do so."

"Our PAP Ministers gave an explanation, and that shall be FINAL!

Don't second guess, do not spread falsehood or fakenews!

In November last year, the Paper 2 Additional Mathematics scripts of 32 students were lost after a Cambridge Assessment examiner misplaced a bag containing the scripts during a train journey in the UK.

In 2017, a parcel containing A level Chemistry answer scripts from 238 students was stolen from a locked courier van that was on its way to an examiner in the UK.

In response to MPs who called for written scripts to be marked locally, Ong said that a very substantial amount of “highly qualified resources” would be needed to do so. Teachers would also have to work within a tight timeline between the conclusion of exams and the release of results, he added."
"To Everyone in this Website, Especially PAP, Opposition Parties & All Singaporean,

What is the use if Singaporean have the BEST EDUCATION when this Cruel Reality in Singapore Labour Market is still IGNORE by Singapore Government :==>

From this website on “ More examinations to be administered on electronic devices so that it can better reflect real-life situations that students will go through later in life “, Singapore Government DON’T seem to care of these BIG PROBLEMS that are widespread in Singapore for many years , or can even say PURPOSELY IGNORE such BIG PROBLEM :==>>

Not only blue collar jobs , even white collar jobs of highly educated younger Singaporean & university graduates are in danger too, due to Greedy Singapore employers hire Singaporean temporarily , like 1 - 6 months , & then SACK them with All types of EXCUSES , including Unscrupulously fabricated “ WITCH HUNTING “ Excuses . . .

After these“ ROUGE EMPLOYERS “ have any how SACK many Singaporean Employees from their Jobs , these “ ROUGE EMPLOYERS “ COMPLAIN to Relevant Authorities, like Ministry of Manpower, that Singaporean employees , for both with University Degree & Relevant qualification , are Bad , Lousy & etc. & then , use these “ EXCUSES “ to PRESS Singapore Government to allow more so called "" FOREIGN TALENTS "" or , any one with little educational qualification to be HIRE for PMET Jobs by them , BUT , paid such people with LOW SALARIES :===>

Eg : Engineer with recognized Degree from NUS, NTU or other recognized universities by MOE & several years of relevant working experience usually command salary of $3000 - $6000 /month , BUT , FOREIGN "" engineer "" that has NO recognized degrees or required certificates & with several years of "" Relevant Working Experience "" in other countries , can be paid salary at around $1000/month .

Eg : Architect that had recognized Degree from NUS, NTU or other recognized universities by MOE & several years of relevant working experience usually command salary of $6000 - $12000 /month , BUT , FOREIGN "" architect "" that has NO recognized degrees or required certificates & with several years of "" Relevant Working Experience "" in other countries , can be paid salary at around $1000 - $2000/month .

Eg : Accountant that had recognized Degree from NUS, NTU or other recognized universities by MOE usually command salary of $3000 - $9000 /month , BUT , FOREIGN "" accountant "" that has NO recognized degrees or required certificates & with several years "" Relevant Working Experience "" in other countries , can be paid salary at around $1000 - $1500/month .

[ * * * NOTE :==>> In other foreign countries, if a person has enough so called "" Relevant Work Experience "", a person can be qualified as "" Qualified Professionals / PMETs "" in their own countries , despite lack of education .

It's like Singapore in 1950s to even early 2000s , when even have Primary School Education alone, is enough to be Top Directors in big companies , like Banks .

( Like poorly educated Bangladeshi / Bangla workers take over PMET jobs, like Engineers & etc. in key industries . . . )

At most, such Cunning Bosses hired these "" CHEAP PROFESSIONALS / PMETs "" & then give them the Positions of IT Engineers , Aerodynamic Engineers , Electrical Engineers , Civil Engineers , Mechanical Engineers , Accountants , Architects & etc., in their companies, without letting the clients, relevant authorities or other relevant people know of the Truth because NOBODY want to CHECK it any way . . . ]

CUT CORNERS a lot to MAXIMIZE PROFITS of Companies & EARN HIGH SALARIES & HIGH BONUSES by Top Management , BUT, DON'T CARE whether can give Good Quality Products & Services OR not , even if end up giving only Bad Products & Bad Services .

These usually happen in Construction Industries, Heavy Engineering Industries & other industries, or companies that are HIGHLY CONSERVATIVE & LABOUR INTENSIVE , in which both UNPROFESSIONALISM & UNETHICAL PRACTICES have BECOME A WAY OF LIFE in the CORPORATE / INDUSTRIAL CULTURES in such industries over many years .

* * NOTE :==> Singaporean Work Force is one of the MOST HIGHLY EDUCATED & BEST in the world, even recognized internationally by reputable international bodies , so Singaporean employees can’t be that Bad or Lousy to be justified easily to be SACK by management of Singaporean employers .

I wonder whether our HIGHLY PAID TOP CIVIL SERVANTS have really CHECK on this PROBLEMS over so many years ? ? ?

Really need more “ FIREMAN “ type of Ministers, like Dr Khaw Boon Wah & even Mr Shanmugan, to CLEAN UP , make full HOUSE CLEANING ( Chinese mean : 清理门户 ) & RESTRUCTURE all the MESS that have happened in our “ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ & even Private Sector , BUT need still quite reliable Non-PAP political leaders, like Mr Mr Low Thi Khiang & now, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, to press such cases to happen . . .

The teachers in Singapore are of a high quality and SEAB plus MOE HQ have been producing marking rubrics since goodness knows when. If Spore is to be an educational hub, it has to be bold and take on this challenge of assessment. SEAB was hived off as an autonomous statutory board to do just that. Spore should now be leading the standard of education instead of relying on GCE Cambridge. It is already well-known that our schools' prelim exam are tougher than GEE 'O' and ""A"". We have the standard. But as usual, White Pigs not like Old Guards; prefer business as usual, status quo, and throw coloured smoke like IT based assessment (please lah the Chinese PSLE is only show video and read from screen.. so innovative meh ?). This is the current smug mentality we have in Spore, nurtured by 4G, jia liao bee, not innovative, not daring nor proactive Ministers !"

In future if a similar accident happen, they will either say the rear view camera not working, not clear, disoriented, disconnected, driver never use or never check. NEVER ENDING EXCUSES.

Its very simple, why was the Bionix even there in the 1st place with the jeep in close proximity? Why commanders never position these vehicles in their respective positions? Why leave it to the men to manoeuvre at will? Totally nobody taking care of the situation on the ground. Like that, even if you have DRONES monitoring the exercise also no use. Nobody is watching. This is why accidents keep going up and up...the quality and standard of the people are going DOWN."

死的是别人的儿子 ，又不是自己亲人 ，当然不心疼呀 。。。当做是死了野狗和野猫在街上就是了 。。。

“ Accept & let him go in peace “ as highlight by Aloysius Pang’s brother & Aloysius Pang’s mentor, Dasmond Koh, on Aloysius Pang’s death in army training in New Zealand, is just like that , TREAT the Life & Death of our NSF soldiers & NSmen so VERY, VERY, VERY DIRT CHEAP until cannot DIRT CHEAP any more .

It like even if many thousands of Singaporean have died senselessly & terribly , it is also very, very, very OK at all, by certain people that held important positions in Singapore . . .

Seem to want to INTENTIONALLY & PURPOSELY to IGNORE the whole Big Problems & Sweep the whole Big Problems under carpet again & go on with life, as though nothing has happened & life goes on as usual ! ! !

Is that how our “ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ should behave ? ? ?

It really give us an impression that many Key Civil Servants in Singapore Civil Service , which is regarded internationally as the “ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WORLD “ , are more interested in to EARN the FREE & EASY HIGH SALARIES & also, EARN the FREE & EASY , SWEET-OFF COMFORTABLE LIFE in their WORK PLACES than truly want to work hard & swear hard to serve the people . . . . , ADDICT to COMFORT ZONE & refuse to come out from such EASY-GOING LIFE at all .

Really set a very BAD EXAMPLE to Singaporean people & the whole world , if that is the case , & very WORST , seem to INTENTIONALLY & PURPOSELY do that too . . .

Something is terribly WRONG with the “ DEEP-ROOTED CORPORATE CULTURE “ & “ DEEP-ROOTED SOCIAL CULTURE “ in our “ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WORLD “, which seem to have gone wrong for many years, BUT , seem to Purposely IGNORE by our“ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WORLD “ over many years . . .

OR, should say , simply REFUSE to even take action to prevent such tragedies from happening, like set up special , powerful , completely independent military law enforcement agencies to deal with such problems , in which ordinary low level law enforcement officers are often unable or even too scare to handle . . .

[ Such agencies worked LIKE the American version of JAG or CPIB / CID in the Singapore Arm Forces & SCDF , to investigate POTENTIAL MURDER , ATTEMPT MURDER , ABUSE of POWER , PULLING RANKS , CORRUPTION , POWER PLAY , CHEATING , EMPLOYERS any how SACK NSmen from their jobs for their NS Training , or intentionally DISCRIMINATE NSmen in their jobs for their obligation to NS & etc. .

Very IMPORTANTLY , We need such very Specially trained, very Professionally Committed , very Ethically Upright Law Enforcement Agencies that literally behave like Real Justice Bao / 包青天 & are absolutely FREE from all Political Influences & External Pressures from self-interest groups to deal with such very cunning , bad people , BUT , BUT , so far, there is very few such people exist in SAF or any where in Singapore yet ]

Pay HIGH SALARIES to Top Civil Servants are really still FAIR & REASONABLE to most of us , if we are to attract really RIGHT type of people & really TALENT people to work as Top Civil Servants .

However, the very things that nobody can TOLERATE is that after paying HIGH SALARIES to top civil servants , these top civil servants still CAN'T serve the Singaporean People, Singapore Society & the nation well at all , or WORST, even purposely ABUSE of POWER or, intentionally behave in IRRESPONSIBLE WAYS that can cause Harms & Destruction to Singaporean people . . .

"PICTURES deceiving. If the maximum distance between them cannot have been more than 19m then based on the average length of an armored vehicle of 6 metres, we are only talking about 3 tank spacings.

Picture above shows at least 5 to 6 tank spacings. The vehicle commander should be charged and demoted for stopping the vehicle in such close proximity to the Bionix. Also, there should be a commander at the cupola during reverse not just rely on technology to move the vehicle. The officers in-charge of planning and training these Bionix drivers should also be held accountable.

Don't suka suka blame the comms eqpt. Eqpt are prone to failure."
"""Dr Ng said that there has been an average of one NS training-related death a year over the past two decades. He also noted that there were no training-related deaths from 2013 to 2016.""
Dear Dr Ng, one death is already too many, sir."
"1. All 4 are NSFs means none hv adequate technical and field experience. Shouldn't there be at least 1 regular out of 4?

2. The Captain directed Liu to move but was later stopped due to gunshots. Why didn't the Captain instruct Liu to reverse when the rover was clearly too near to the Bionix?

3. When the Bionix started reversing in the Rover direction, why instead of instructing Liu to reverse, the Captain spent the 8 stationery seconds waving and gesturing like a bladdy idiot?"
"Surely its the Land Rover vehicle commander that should be to blame. Its his responsibility to look after his vehicle and crew. We are all told to take training seriously. Imagine if you were facing real enemy fire in front. You think you then need to care about avoiding some idiot closing up behind you? You save your own crew and vehicle first and the people behind you are responsible for saving themselves. How else then are you supposed to take training realistically?
Now they are investigating the comms? Why? So they can blame the Bionix driver or the comms and protect the “regular trainer holding the rank of Captain from the Active Unit Training Centre”? What is is? A Government scholar that needs protection? Isnt it obvious who us to blame here for ordering the overtaking and closing up when the Bionix is supposed to be in combat training?"
"If he can say the Bionix only ""partially mounted"" the Rover, when the leaked photo showed otherwise (Rover was totally crushed with the Bionix having run through the length of the rover), then NEH's words aren't worth much nowadays. Probably smoking half the story."
"Many SAF drivers actually treat the commanders as transparent. Even when a rear guide is stationed there, it was usually for a show. Most just trusted the driver to do the job properly. That was my experience with M113 drivers"
Why a safe distance not kept? When the Bronix reversed why did the land rover not reverse instead of staying stationed to be reversed on? No one could see where they driving? Why create a vehicle no one could see/hear where they are driving?
"Most cars today have a reverse camera, our multi million dollar system cannot have?"
"Aiyah, conclusion is always T0P elites are not at fault lah. No need for any ACC0UNTABILITY whatsoever.

69.9% dun care since it is not their own S0N, so pls just continue to v0te for 'Pay And Pay'. Some more got 'Murder-Kah' package to c0ver for 'Gahmen Sure Tax' (GST) increase lor. Hrrh hhr hr."
"We pay a minister millions so that he could just present the findings of work done by another group of people. Honestly, we can't find someone to do that by paying him/her S$100k or less instead?"
Even a rear camera will not prevent a future tragedy. The issue why are live-training armoured vehicles sharing the same road or space with non-combat vehicles?
"Why would the trainer and Liu gestured to the Bionix to stop, when the Bionix driver could not see them? The Land Rover was in the undertake position, not over taking position? The Land Rover operated by operator, not a qualified driver?"
"The 4 persons in the Bionix should be disciplined and demoted, including the 2LT. Take responsibility."
"2 things immediately jumped out. (1) Soldiers had sufficient rest....yeah right. The self deceiving 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep. (2) Comms equipment was working properly. Anyone whose been inside one of those cramped ovens know that equipment, gears and weapons are chucked in there like nobody's business. It is a miracle that half of the equipment still functions after all that rugged treatment."
"Not a bionix or M113 crew but eons ago belonged to a V200 (wheeled tank variety) crew. My understanding is simple; the driver has no way of seeing behind him. Every reverse required a guide in front and at the back. Instructions not issued via mic or headsets BECAUSE no matter the tests, instruments can fail intermittently. Therefore reversing is by sign language- steer left, right, reverse, stop; no accidents whatsoever I’ve heard of. The driver of the V200 pays 110% attention to the guide in front; while the guide in front coordinates with the guide at the rear. What abolished those practices? It’s like we had a safe practice but regressed."
That’s why inside the tank intercom systems is very important as the engines are loud. I would love to crush Mahathir underneath my tank.
"This young NS man died because of faulty design of Bionix AFV. In battle these vehicles will reverse at full speed to avoid enemy fire and ambush. How can it be done with no rear view mirror nor reverse cameras? The reaction time using a reverse soldier is too slow. The driver can't hear him over the noisy engine and the gunfire. Don't blame the NSF drivers and staff. They are all told not to act smart and appear arrogant. Based on a blindlyreversing driver at full speed the comms equipment is gtssly5i adequate and inappropriate. What if the reversing lookout is injured or under fire??
The ones responsible are much higher up.
Who designed the vehicle. Who approved its purchase. Who allowed it to run despite being an obvious flaw that will be fatal in real battle??"
No need electronic warfare already comm disrupted. Wonder what happens if real war. Cannot coordinate at all?
"Need to move with times. Why do we still need a primitive style, - trainer on a vehicle to evaluate the exercise? Cannot use cameras, drones in the sky to evaluate?"
Why was live training with live firing at road junctions where non-combat vehicles are transversing? Did the COI asked all the questions that should have been asked?
"Keep having so many accidents that lead to death of someone else's son. The parents went through so much hardship to raise a child and then......X. What about those cases that was not made known to the public? Who want to send their sons to the army now, raise your hands."
Why takes so long to investigate fr the police end?
stop the 'blame culture'. -- the top is responsible no matter what. -- thats only a teenager heavy vehicle driver. -- who to blame ??
"Young singaporean are forced to perform and serve national duties for 2 years NSF and 10 year reservists duties and getting peanut salary in return,

And yet Singaporeans have to buy private , resales houses and
Car at expensive prices, prices that are the same with the PR.
And yet jobs are open equally between Singapore and PR

All these are with the conditions that Singaporeans must perform 12 years national duties and PR is totally not required .
What do Singaporeans serve national service for ?"
I dont buy this story.
"So Dr Ng, ypu are going to protect the trainer (vehicle commander of Land Rover) ?
Your concept has always been to not hold commanders to personal responsibility otherwise they will be too scared to carry their role effectively and SAF will suffer. Now you are faced with a quamire as parents are worried about sending their sons to NS. NS is facing an existential crisis. What next ?"
"Regardless of what kinda military death, defense minister, chief of army and any officer above the captain rank will be immunized. Usually, Captain and below take the rap.

Rank above captain take the highest pay and rank captain and below take the rap."
"If systems are faulty, what happens in an actual war? If you are a driver and you see another vehicle reversing at you...do you not blast your horn? In this case, why did the victim not jump out of his vehicle, reverse, etc? Is there something more fundamental? Are soldiers acting or reacting like morons, without brains? Or more afraid of being punished than to do what is sensible when there is a crises? Where was that critical thinking in these two tragedies? Sure they were not frozen in fear."
"It takes 2 persons to clap. The Bionix driver must be aware that the landrover was behind and the landrover must also be aware that the Bionix was reversing. It just take one driver to act to prevent this tragedy.On hindsight, It would be easier for the landrover driver to reverse to avoid the Bionix."
"So it is the usually PAP ""not my problem again"" answer."
"NSF Liu Kai's death: Bionix driver kept reversing despite commands to stop
Sack the PAP millionaire minister in charge of MINDEF"
"There are a two interesting questions to this accident that the authorities can consider. They are:

1. What is the land rover doing in an exercise comprising Bionix vehicles? Shouldn't another Bionix or armor vehicle be used instead? Then there will not be such problems like a Bionix climbing onto a land rover. At best, it would be a Bionix crashing into another Bionix which will just end up in vehicle damages.

Comment: A different class of vehicle has many disadvantages like visibility and driving from the rear does not give clarity on what is happening in front of the bigger Bionix. The breaching of safety distances in an action and reaction training seem to be inevitable. As such, should the land rover be mixed in there within the armor maneouvre?

2. Communications not working? Are there no primary and secondary communications system? It is quite evident that communications is a major factor in this accident. But isn't communications a primary core system required for war? Then why is the communications not working? Is this acceptable?

Comment: Communications is key and there are many kinds. Voice as well as digital/data communications. And voice usually has primary and secondary sets. Tactical situations using digital/data communications on vehicle mounted displays would show all vehicles on a digital map. This enables combat teams to be able to fight as a system. In such cases, all vehicles should know where all the other vehicles are even without voice communications. Does the Bionix not have this? Is this not a vital system to have on all our combat vehicles? Or is it too expensive?"
"Dr Ng, this is not related to army mishaps. But - there used to be a pasar malam in TP central just before CNY for the past years. This year - don't have - what happened? The TP MRT escalator has been out of order for 2 months and there are many old folks in TP who find it hard to use the stairs - what happened? Why didn't you take a navy boat to cruise Singapore territorial waters like the Malaysian navy did?"
"Example if the airline plane gone down,the highest pay CEO will now & resign in big company or corporation."
"One reason I can perceive is the Land Rover operated by operator, not qualified driver. Land Rover Vehicle Commander also no driving license and panic. No war, but got fatality. If got war, may be none available for fighting war?"
This is asking for trouble on all fronts? Driving a vehicle no one could see or hear? Dr Ng would u drive if you cant see front nor rear?
"As expected, the Bionix commander is an officer (2LT), since the controller/trainer vehicle is usually tied to the unit commander (platoon or company level) during exercises. So is this a White Horse, so blame on the lowly driver instead? Even if the rear guide repeatedly told the driver to stop over the intercom, the vehicle commander would also had heard the warnings; a practical method (in IFVs) is for the commander to quickly KICK the driver's back/shoulder when urgent, and the driver should stop immediately."
Even animal can communicate better omg! Please please dont give silly info like i did not hear so i kill that poor kid...q ...is what is correct process...like never engage gear without physically checking anyone behind or no one should stand there or anywhere when there is a moving vehicle ...who is writing realistic sop. It is like that burmese maid bringing kid running across busy road...she expect driver to see her...then she must wear sightable clothing like traffic light. Not using overhead is no excuse if someones lost her life...it should be manslaughter...rather than charging the taxi driver who is just driving...hello? So if someone dash across hamilton driveway ...he drove over them then he is charged?
"Yes a doctor is qualified to be the Defence Minister. His job is to make annoucement of NS boys' death. What's wrong with SAF scholars being given Minister's post. 70% supported and gave the mandate to the ruling government. I see nothing wrong. His wife Ivy Ng, SInghealth CEO was fined 'a substancial' amount for the cyber attack case but still retained her job. $10, $100, $1000 etc. With high salary $1000k is nothing to be called substancial amount. To the card boxes auntie and uncle collectors"
"Would the Minister for Defence care to share the number of serious service injuries, like the loss of a leg, inflicted on MINDEF personnel in the last 16 months, please."
"Wondering if SAF transport officer is qualified to drive the tonner during their in camp training.The driver,life is at risk.What more if they are behind the wheel during their overseas training in unfamiliar terrain.As per normal SAF commander assumption driver had training during their NS day so competent but I doubt so! ."
"I supposed what does the COI tells us here?

We just need a few Mirrors and the Problem solve.

So Lui Kai's Death is a BOON or BANE?

BUT is the SAF ""SAFER"" for NSF after Lui Kai?

ANSWER IS NO, RIGHT?

Again just another LESSON LEARNED?"
"Time to rethink about criminal liability for officers in the SAF. The current practice is not to hold them to civilian type of criminal prosecution and we always see a mere slap on the wrist as in a demotion or, even for some, just a slight delay in promotion.
In civilian lives, we will have to face jail sentence if guilty of reckless or rash act causing death on the road. Here we have token punishment involving delayed promotion. What a joke. MINDEF is treating our sons like trash for the purpose of military training."
"the bionix driver may have got too engrossed on the training exercise. in real war, there is no safety or training vehicles following behind.

i always admired armoured infantry. no need run here and there like siao like that. guess it also has its bad things happen."
"Whose son this time?
How many more ?"
"During my V200 armoured vehicles days, the intercom hardly works. We shouted to each other most of the time. So not surprised that it doesn't work this time."
But the minister will not resign. Neither will any of his paper generals. The ones who will face the music are the junior officers and specialists. The senior ones move on in their career as planned. What a world that is!
"Gun fire noise, bonix tanks are noisy, all shouting at same time inside the cabin and you expect driver to be able to listen, analyse and react. With the new gen, most young men already spoilt their eardrum listening too much on their smartphones."
get world highest pay people will not resign la
Motherfugger grandmother long story
"To the card boxes auntie and uncle collectors $10 is substancial amount. LHL had failed donkey yrs ago. An egoitics, incapable and dishounoural son and the cronies still do not feel ashamed of themsevles. All for Million dollars salaries. Whta else can we say? 70% voted them to form governement and more will come. An increase of new citizens and selfish Singaporeans bragging their HDB flats high price. Now let's see what they have to say after what Lawrence said. 4 AND 5 rm Telok Blangah left about 50 yrs lease no buyers. Wish Sg will go down turn in economy and further deep down. That will teach sgaporeans a lesson to be humble."
"very bad situational awareness. if almost collision and no way to escape with equipment in time, exit and abandon the land rover and run for your lives lah. must be practical, things dun always go according to plan. very rigid reactions."
"So no one at the top is held accountable for the deaths.
The defence Minister and his paper general Cronies are still having the jobs and drawing their million $$$ pay checks."
Must as well say liu kai was playing with a spider on the dashboard when it hapoens
Just wonder why the land rover don't reverse or get out of the way. At most get out from the land rover. Too many details are missing
Another very bad design vehicle by SAF defence science company that causes NSF men 's death.
"jUst charge the driver of the BIONIX. Not paying attention to commands. What, you need to be in 3 languages?"
Do NS still liable to be prosecuted. Bears to to the fault of lower ranks while the elites just use their mouth. This is nonsense. NS need to be scrapped.
Please train the NS Men how to escape from danger also. Today's Millenials seldom do any sport. They become less agile and less streetsmart. As devices become smarter and smarter average human being become more reliant on them and less responsive to sudden changes in their surroundings.
Why don't Liu Kai reverse the land rover if see situation not right?
"The lesson for common NSF to learn is to never entrust another conscripted joe with your own safety. Use your own brain to see if situation make sense, run away if you must."
"I think only when one of the minister's son die during NS or reservist, then the whole system will change. It is not their next of kin's life, thus they don't feel the pain of loss."
So did not hear means can kill someone...alrwady so nousy so u exoect the command to be heard...please uncles ...the process is X...no contingency...
this breast surgeon word is like telling a family the procedure he did for a surgery and how successful the operations went but the patient died.... its the outcome not the process pappies......
This Bionix is very dangerous as driver can't see behind while reversing. A front guide should be there too to give hand signal to stop in case of emergency.
NS should start at age 19 with full salary for 1.5 years. -- stop wasting those guys precious time & lives.
Why were the shots fired in the first place? That was the primary cause of the whole accident.
Lesson Learned : all armoured vehicles should be upgraded to have rear view using camera just like many civilian cars nowadays installed front cameras
"If that was war time, Sg soldier killed Sg soldier, not by enemy."
The trainer is reckless to ask the driver to overtake and then allow driver to stop close behind the BIONIX. Mystery as to why land rover did not attempt to reverse or the occupants get out of vehicle. Suspicion is that land rover stopped very very close behind BIONIX.
"I think the driver ignored the commands and wanted to lood, that's all."
Finger pointing again... now blame the driver cannot hear
"Im not surprised parent's are worried for their sons who has to serve ns. The bullying culture, vulgarities are still around. The safety standards are unreliable. NSFs gets mistreated. If not why lots of them has depressions during thier 2 yrs?. With recents deaths going, hiw can we get assurance that our sons will be fine in there? When something happens, its sk simple. Oh its an accident. 😒 How about the parents feeling? Of coz these people dont feel anything coz its not thier son.When parents complain They say boys nowadays are all spoonfed. This is not spoonfed. This is concern. As much as we all wants our sons to grow into a man. They still hv parents whom are responsible for thier well being. Govnt can give many excuses or throw as much $ as they want. Its still not gonna bring back their sons."
Ng must think we are quite stupid. 1 average death over past 2 decades do not matter- s what matters is what’s happening in the last 2 years
Another blame on others to clear theirs name. If you make a mistakes in life please accept it to improve and not always think you are right. Will it improve your life or will you be better in future.
"Sg is too noisy a place to live in, there is no respect for rest time, privacy and space"
step down la still sit there...
"The whole crux of this unfortunate occurrence is: THIS IS ONE BLARDY SMALL INCIDENT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN T-O-T-A-L-L-Y AVOIDED, LEST TALKING ABOUT KILLING AN INNOCENT BOY!!!

And yet our SAF, which is suppose to be an 'advanced-technology equipped' force, CAN ACTUALLY ALLOW SUCH A STOOOOOOO-PIG, SMALL ERROR TO ACTUALLY KILL A HUMAN. What the F is going on with Singapore?!"
"saf should tell nsmen if not real war no need so 认真。if one big truck coming after you, just open door and jump out of vehicle and let it get crushed. court martial better than lose life."
"""smart nation"" woh...."
"Question: Why no wayang and parliament tong tong chiang for this soldier ? Is it because he not famous, not as handsome and lesser known than Aloysius and less brownie points for Ministers to score is it ? How about over-heated guardsman ?"
Ask Ng to go get f..k!
obviously miscomm.. no need COI to tell us..
"Every yr budget increase to spend on defence, but this silly & basic accident still happen? Some heads need to roll to send the right signal"
Bionix is a lousy tank build by ST not up to the standard .
"Wow. Susan Lim overcharged.
Dr Ng Eng Hern, sure can cook stories. Muz have lots of Indian frens>!!
Now Indian can be Malay.! Can PAP be TRUSTED is up to citizens now!!"
When u dig deeper you are amazed by the moronic unsafe features presence which no sane does on daily lives much lest preparation for battle.
"Ng E H, what are you doing? Why so many deaths in SAF ? SHUTDOWN LAH !!!"
"Actually one can easily draw his or her own conclusions..

1. The operating procedures and safety measures were in place.
2. The personnels were adequately trained and qualified.
3. There was no known malfunction of the equipment.
4. Overall, thousands of servicemen had operated on this system for more than 15 years with no related injury due to lowering of the gun.

Therefore the task was not a dangerous one.

For this case, the only shortcoming of the SAF... is that it cannot ensure that all these 3 soldiers inside follow the correct procedures, without endangering themselves or others."
Dr Ng said that there has been an average of one NS training-related death a year over the past two decades. He also noted that there were no training-related deaths from 2013 to 2016. Why ah Ng dare not mentioned accidents or death rates between 2017 n 2018? Why purposely avoiding this 2 years information? Why play with words if not guilty .?
"What the Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen is saying is that at the time of the incident that led to the death of Aloysius Pang, the 2 other SAF personnel with him were adequately trained by the SAF to service that artillery weapon. They were similarly qualified to carry out their duties, so it isn't MINDEF's fault that 1 of them was killed i.e. it was nobody's fault as usual, so we all must move on. End of inquiry."
"Push here and push there,in the end some small small fly will take the responsibility and the top top Paper General and the Minister still will get MILLION of dollar salary and Big Big Bonus in the end of the year.This soldier die for the country during training,but no minister or General dare to attend,but a billionaire son pass away,many many high rank Minister rush to attend,even its Chinese New Year Eve,what is going wrong with our PAP Gov?"
"I am wondering why the tank cannot be built with a little more space to allow for the lowering of the barrel without creating a killing zone.
A design problem is still a design problem whether the machine has been used for decades or centuries without an incident.
Murphy Law says that if something can happen, it will happen and it can happen multiple times within a short period even if there were no previous incidents in the last millennia for all we care.
This is the concept of probability and it defies logic that there is even any attempt by people to cite a clean history stretching back XXX years."
"It is a senseless death that should not happen to any one.

Aloysius is not available to speak for himself.

His death shines a spotlight on the training ground, especially for reservist training overseas, and on the lack of safety precautions in place till something tragic happens, by which time it is too late to remedy the situation.

On a personal level, though I do not know Aloysius, I feel for him as a fellow human being, the physical pain he suffered during his last few days; I prayed for salvation of his soul, his eternal life in Heaven.

God Bless! :-)"
"The explanation is completely unsatisfactorily. This million dollar minister is just telling people that all the operators are trained. If this is so, then the SOP is flawed, if the SOP is not flawed, then what is it?? I mean looking at the position, who is supposed to ensure that all operators are in safely in their seats before giving permission for the gun to be lowered? This minister is just telling people that everything is in placed obviously it is not."
Are a new Defence minister taking over from the existing Defence Minister and army general be replaced after many wrote requesting them be replaced last month.
"There are questions left unanswered to this tragic incident.
1) How did AP who is a qualified and trained technician ended up mysteriously getting caught on the end of the barrel when it's lowered when hes supposed to be cleared of the barrel when it's lowered?
2) What exactly happened and what were the three men actually doing during the lowering of the barrel drill, did they follow proper safety procedures or they fooling around?
3) Who are the other two crew members? Why are their identities protected? What did they actually witness at the time of the incident?
4) Is there any possible foul play involve?"
"The Defence Minister said that Aloysius was serving his 7th ICT stint & was trained to perform maintenance work & repairs for the SSPH since he was a full-time serviceman. In other words, he was experienced & well-trained by the SAF, so it is not the SAF's fault that Aloysius failed to get out of harm's way in spite of having 9 seconds to do so. Seems like Ng Eng Hen is distancing MINDEF from any blame."
"Two other SAF personnel in vehicle at time of incident were 'similarly qualified'
So what is the verdict? I still dont get the picture. Why keep repeating how SSPH works.. haiz"
"NEH/Mindef still continuing with their disinformation - now the ""end of barrel"" becomes a flicker rammer.

Look at the pics - only 3 persons, but the SSPH is supposed to have 4 persons inside the ""cabin"". The pics are therefore intended to paint a less crowded space within the vehicle than actual.

And as suspected, Alyosius was likely caught by the RISING rammer/loading mechanism - which makes it very unusual that the 2 others with him couldn't see he was being lifted.

Note that there is a gun guard for the loader on the right, but the left is devoid of any such guards. The accident therefore likely occurred from left side."
"Deaths never stop because army not tracking those who are responsible for deaths. Just RE-deploy them. Worse is those who are higher up and responsible are not even identified. Some senior officers can make decisions that undermine the safety of the lower ranking soldiers, but when an accident occurs, the blame is always on the people that are on the ground. Eg. ""Why the grenade blow up in your hand? Because you didn't throw fast enough lah!. Not because the grenade brand has now been changed to detonate in 5 seconds instead of 11 due to a lousy purchasing decision""."
In the first place how did a doctor become a defense minister with any military experience and training himself.
"Accident already happen now the high rank will try to cover it ,i use to work with mindef G1 ,so many accident happen during my time in 1981 lor,COI just for show for the minister to see and pass through."
"Humans..the common denominator. Elminate the need for humans to be close to a moving machinery and you have zero accidents but this is often impossible. You need humans to be close to a moving machinery. Where safety protocols have been violated, where personal awareness have been insufficient, we will again have the tragic circumstances. Sensors, remote monitors, auto-stop devices, etc. can reduce the incidences. However, you still have to depend on the humans to exercise their care. And the need to emphasise that it their life and limbs that are at stake or those of their team-mates. SAF is not a dangerous vocation in peace time. Heavy construction is even more dangerous.. I have been in construction for over 30 years and each day can be my last. Total vigilance is demanded and yet I am never certain that someone's mistake can end my life."
"No, No, please do not say that end of the investigation report-We regret this is an unfortunate incident, we will for sure follow tightly on the SOP."
A mistake is a mistake. Face it and please take responsibility for the accident if you want the nation to have confidence in the Govt.
Nothing wrong with machine and personnel fully trained. Can we investigate whether he was purposely killed?
"After all these incidents We should know who do vote.
My personal stand is I have lost trust in them."
What I was told to me in 1967 when I was called for NS. The regular army defend the country and its people in war. NS is trained to fight against the enemy. They said NS training is simple one than the regular army. They said regular army training is tough and NS is simple. Now is NS going through tough training just like regular army.
"Young singaporean are forced to perform and serve national duties for 2 years NSF and 10 year reservists duties and getting peanut salary in return,

And yet Singaporeans have to buy private , resales houses and
Car at expensive prices, prices that are the same with the PR.

All these are with the conditions that Singaporeans must perform 12 years national duties and PR is totally not required .
What do Singaporeans serve national service for ?"
"So 4 person at the area? 3 of them fully blinded without alert poor Aloy? The senior gun commander what was he doing? Poor Aloy died for nothing, unfair to him. In the end of the investigation report, don't push the blame to the deceased."
"Are you implying that Pang's injury was self-inflicted, there was no justifiable reason for him doing so as he has bright future lying ahead and he is filial son!! And there was no superficial reason why the battalion sabotaged Alloysius to endanger his life.

This is not a satisfactory answer as if one licensed would misfire occasionally.

Cut the crab. You just need to answer the public and Pang 's aggrieved family who ordered to press the button. Did he know that Pang was inside the confined space???"
any design fault ? since its a space constraint for someone to escape?
"No minister son die, COI and all talk cork sessions are just load of B/S"
"Aiyah, however qualified reservists are on P@Per, they cannot be compared to full timers who work, use & train with the same equipment throughout the year. Because all equipment develop quirks over time & it may take a keen eye & seasoned hands to notice & act accordingly."
just get to the bottom of his death! You owe an answer to his parents and all other worrying parents of those going to service the army including my only son! Dont just talk and talk over this wo any conclusion! So sick and tired of hearing excuses for those death incidents!
As usual army got issues just push to the commander officer to answer and let move on.But got credit they will be the first ones to own it.That's our Defence Minister way of solve problems
"As expected, a non-answer from the PAPig bigwig. Ownself Check Ownself, No Blame Culture, Let’s Move On."
I still don't get it ? What he trying to explains . Singapore Son got killed during training.
"Tank run over jeep - end up COI (no repeat of accident till now ... )
SSPH crush NS men - COI again (hopefully no repeat cases)

do we need 1 COI for every type of equipment used?

Which type of vehicles or equipment need to encounter accident and cause the lost of another son of Singaporean before we see COI again?

WHY CANT SAFETY BE REVIEW ACROSS THE BOARD to ensure really ""0"" death due to accident during training?

we are already at a low birth rates as we speak ... we really cannot afford to lose another"
this update = no update
"There was never a question of incompetent personnel in place for Aloysius Pang incident. Anyone who have serve army fully understood that only trained and qualify personnel are allow to operated in their own speciality. The main issue that Pang been injured is a surprise element that he cannot react in time. The question remain why is the gun moving while maintenance is in progress. So who move the gun then or is there a necessities to move the gun while maintenance is in progress. If so, then who is in command and control of the situation. Is the procedure been observe, safety been implemented and executed."
"As 9 seconds is a very short time to get to a safe place, shouldn't the gun be moved Only when everyone is in a safe place? So you announce the gun is going to move. Yu Wait for the people to move. And the gun starts moving Only when they're out of the way. One gets the impression the 3 guys were told the gun was going to be moved and had 9 seconds to scramble out of the way."
I think just scrape the SSPH now. How is it possible to fight the enemy when most of the time is spent on this safety procedure?
He means that qualify does not mean no incident to accident. Just as patient who undergo a knife for operation that to agrees to sign a consent on risk.
They are just talking and talking somethings that a lot of Peoples don understand. Smoke again.
He also means that negligence by qualified higher rankings are immunity from getting trial on accident.
"Who are the other 2 personals with Pang and why are they not allowed to disclose what actually happened in an inquiry with video open to the public? In my opinion, regardless of whether the fault is due to anyone, SAF should be responsible for the death of Pang."
"Slowly shifting the blame to Aloysius. Of course, dead man won't speak. Top guys will continue to collect millions. It all makes perfect sense!!!"
MINDEF & SAF should shutdown. Better go fuxking.
I am baffled why Dr Ng told couldn't tell parliament straight answer why Aloysius was seriously injured leading to his death in a small cabin of 3 persons ? The other two were still alive and taking statements from them would straight away knew the answer immediately instead of blah blah >>>>>>in parliament but no answer. Very perturbed !!!!!!!
"LEND ME YOUR EARS; One death is too many and we have been losing father's and mother's sons to serving a force NSF and Reservists in frontline to protecting tbe country. Cold war is over and Singapore is nember is United Nation Countries. We pay U.N membership promptly.
Our country has already invaded by mencenary foreigners, Employers perfer to choose non-reservists over reservists regardless Singaporeans working oversea or local. In term of doing bussiness to venture out of Singapore, Singaporeans are also in disadvantages.
Dis-solve NSF and Reservists to employ full combatants to training at the highest level at the ability to attack that is best defense.
- Dis-solve NSF and Reservists."
"look like someone is sleeping during the incident, hmmm......"
Ask the two men came to tell the true and witness the cause of the accident
The only way to improve the system is to sack the top people
"DID any one hear CCS say that GST will not increase another 2% ?
You know what, Now PAP everyone get scare TanCB form a new party plan to take over as Singapore Government coming GE2019.
PAP start trying to fool all our Singaporeans again.
If Singaporeans again give in to PAP coming GE.
PAP will for sure implement more system on our CPF and everyone will never got a way to take a single cents out.
Singaporeans must not be a stupid slave fool for PAP again, Just Vote them PAP out and have a new Government make a new change on lot of unfair system created by PAP."
Something is fishy. I believe there is a sabotage if not accidentally.
WONDER THERE IS Any WEAPON expert. That is qualify and not just similarly qualify
"Why Vietnam win the war against the US. US use NS soldiers wheras vietnam use regular. US win the world war 2 using US regular soldiers. Afterthat US used NS for war.
See how many wars US never fight to win so far after world war 2."
"saf has joint the many govt & govt related entities as a money making entity. -- developing and producing weapons & military hardware (software) for sale, internationally. -- thats to cover its own overheads & huge bonuses, etc. -- all other main revenues collected in singapore, goes to 2 entities, GIC & TH, under the familee names & pilfered out of the country in the name of, 'overseas investments', never to be return."
Sir the question is are own army do not have full time staff to service and need NS to service thank
"Still cannot understand how he could be pinned down after looking at the pictures. Do't they have camera in the chamber to record all the movement in the vehicle? With that, it will be easier to understand he could get crushed if everyone in the vehicle cabin were all in standing position."
the morale of this story saf is saying the guy death is due to his own neligence.
"why don't commander just say, gun coming down, don't block, can or not? then they rest reply once all reply. commander say, i press button now."
please gather all the keyboard eunuchs here to serve NS as regular soldiers.
Here they go again. Trying to divert attention to the lower rank NSF and maybe will pin the fault with Aloysius later when people are less angry. Will probably come out with some stupid safety recommendation and then all these senior officer will never be punish. This just show how much they protect their scholar and paper general. Doesn't this remind you of SMRT?
Mr. Ng EH & your senior officials/Generals can keep talking how important safety is in the army ...blah blah ....because talk is cheap. We had been hearing the same thing over and over again whenever a soldier died during peace time training.
Coordination problem. Just like liu kai case. The three operating the equipment not communicating properly.
"I am still blur after listening to ALL news about the death incident of Aloysius. All telling all the personnel have not doing anything wrong and there were no any mechanical problems.
My question is if so how can Aloysius lost his life ???"
"Abolish NS n just sign a protection treaty with US, Australia n NATO."
If there are pictures or videos taken before Pang is removed will reveal more information.
Soldiers are meant to be tough and well-tranied. My respect to the SAF commando soldiers back then. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfLNs1EokMQ
Dead man tells no tales. It's up to those alive from top down to say whatever is needed to cover their backs. I rest my case.
"They have since been removed from their operational roles and redeployed. --------------- AKA, ... SILENCED."
"What new is this and waste tax payers $$$$ and time.
What was say already know. Broken recorder repeating ."
"This Minister said
But he also urged Singaporeans not to overlook the reason why males citizens had to undergo military training -- to protect the country..............
------------
Yes , protect the country is important.. but have you ever thought about protecting your citizen from jobs ,career and cost of living ...

why bring in so many foreign to compete with our boy while they serving their 2 years in the Army ..wasting 2 years of their precious time ... where they can build their career without taken away by the so call foreign talent....

what our boy protecting about .... the country or the rice bowl of foreigner

please, enlighten us Singaporean... your citizen"
Remember that guy who was a captain caused another accident - the SAF ignored all our complaints and promoted him to major. Haiz!
Say like never say like that.
So if it is not the design fault? not the 2 SAF personnel fault? Not MinDeaf fault? Not 7 month? So are you trying to push the fault to the died? Claimming Psng maybe day dreaming. .!?
"4 deaths in 17 months under your watch... Totally unacceptable and don't just talk and push responsibilities. You are paid to be the Minister of Defense and you will be held accountable and responsible for any lapses, especially over 4 lives. PM Lee promised Singaporeans in the last GE that he and his government will be held accountable for their failure. Talk is cheap, show us the action, not excuses or scapegoats."
"I supposed it is called ""SLOWLY AND STEADILY..""

This incident will DIE A SLOW DEATH, whether COI or NOT.

And then ONLY the Elites will ""triumph"" for another day and the $,$$$,$$$ Paychecks still going into their ""Reserves"" steadily.

Didn't the famous phrase:""Past Performance Is NO Indicator Of Future Results"" ring a bell for you 70%?

So these Deaths serve NO purposes at all?

Its Becoming Sin-ka-poor for the rest of Singaporeans."
Only 2 person knew the truth and whatever happened became past and no one other than the 2 persons know the truth.
please step down.
"Safe positions occupied by gun commander, ammunition loader, charge loaders. No other safe position left for poor AP, so he was crushed?"
I still don't get it why AP can't get hit by something so slow. Something is really missing...
"Everyone know a std slogan which You in Army, No complain and take order first.
Haha, Take the order first and no Complain which end up you got no chance to complain cos, You might already be a dead man.
The System must change as "" No such thing as NO complain ""
Better all Top Officers must take Army boy complain and review every issue, Dun keep sit inside office and wait for accident happen and push around with excuses."
"Redesign the SSPH to minimize or eliminate the hazard spots, including the one that killed Aloysius. The laziest and easiest way out in engineering world is just to use ""warning label"" to absolve the risks and liabilities, aka.. ""i told you so..""."
Defence Budget will increase as they may installed cameras inside the vehicles.
"Why don't ask our emeritus
Goh to become Minister of
Defense as he say big good
Pay will retain good Minister in our government
Do all agree?"
"Please make all male PRs and citizens (as Long as they are below age 40) serve national service. Otherwise take away their perks as PRs/ citizens so there fairness for homegrown male citizens. Also, disclose the vocation of sons of all ministers during their NS, to show equity across all homegrown male Singaporean’s."
Got procedure how come he can still be there to be crushed?
Say No To Pap.....
"Kids are always behave like kids, this is what separated boys from mens. Base on the video, if the kid remain in safety area, he should not get hit. Must be playful during maintenance work. Suggest each group should comprise 1 40 years old adult to supervise the kids."
Bottom line is where is the verdict
Ban N.S
"Is a 15 year old gun still expected to function equally well like a new gun ?
What is the margin of malfunctions or allowance given for faults and/or errors in the equipment ???"
"In this case. Pang was clearly did not follow the safety procedures that caused his death. Sad scenario but he must bear the biggest share of the blame. Because the deceased was a celebrity, does not mean he will make no mistakes. It is just another misadventure."
"So he is saying, SAF complied with all the protocols and did nothing wrong. But someone did die right? Meaning to say this will continue to happen and SAF will not be able to stop it because if alreddy did it’s part?"
In the very first place is there any RA carried out in such a confined space? If so it should not have happened. Failure of the system. The G and the heads should take responsibility
"From the video on how they operate with shouting commands, I just don't understand how could it injured Pang and eventually killed him"
The accounts as to what happened seem to differ from what was earlier reported. Now the so called official by Minister is that Pang was crushed inside the vehicle and not outside (as earlier reported). With 2 others inside at that time surely in that small enclosed space occupants will have the time to look out for each other.. The barrel was lowered by someone. Now the big question. Was there a so called safety officer to look out for all this before someone lower the barrel. Looks like some people will be charged soon by the military court because this accident happened in New Zealand.
"The effects are given but not the cause of this accident.
The cause need to be known and future occurrence of such accidents prevented to avoid another casaulty.
Only 2 causes are possible, machines malfunction or human error.
Quickly established this are rectify it."
Too high salary too complacent overlooked foresight maybe time to replace them
This Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen cannot be trusted.
wonder why there was to date no mention of what the 2 other SAF personnel have to say? Was it a human error? Was AP not following an order? Was it an error on their part? Why the silence? It cannot be that SAF has not interviewed them. So why the silence on them and what they were doing at the time of the accident??
"Besides debating on the qualification of the SAF personnel servicing the SSPH, it is also pertinent to debate on the qualification of the Minister for Defence, after all, this is the fourth SAF-training related fatality in 16 months! We dont expect to hear any of our Singapore sons, brothers or even fathers to die every quarter!"
I believe that the surrounding army personal were also similarly qualified. So come the most important question. Where is the weapon expert?
"DR NG MUST RESIGN, NOW."
When AP was in there. There gun moved automatically or someone moved it without knowing AP being there? That is my question.
He should just be told to leave. No amount of pushing blame can bring back all the fallen sons that perished during his excessive term in office.
Big man talks like going round the merry bushes and throwing smokes
Staid news. Give us more info n details on the gun n vehicle n who is the manufacturer n esigner n modification Safety starts fr design stage
"Dear all
We spore is so rich that
Can pay our Minister big
Pay & big bonus ,why not
We hire missionary army
To look after our country
And can save much more
Money same as more foreign talent our government brought in."
Why not the two man came out to witness. Or not tell the true
Could it be that Aloysius Pang was not alert or paying attention enough?
Your Ng T Feng old day sell O-pieng become rich.....
Ministry of defence and SAF are you given us fake news in media and press saying army training need to change and method need to change. So far talk and no change.
It seems that the minister has failed to explain how the end of the lowered gun had come into contact with the victim's chest and abdomen regions. Why?
"So , like that can settle the matter ?"
"what ? we singaporean owe CFC NS Pand and his family, I think better said the SAF owe them an accountable report and at the same time what is the amount of money the SAF must compensate to both aged parents? becasue their son is gone, who want to take care of them till they go off?
I wonder why no compensation of money, already lost a life and they are emotionally depress , worse still if they got to think how to survive for the next 20 to 30years???"
"This NEH is really smoking shxt. So what if the 2 other guys were ""similarly qualified"". Our past 3-4 LTA/MOT/SMRT top management were also ""similarly qualified"" (aka SAF trained or kaki-lan), yet the train system continued to have disruptions again and again and again. Qualified to Fail?"
They are smart not to charge them for negligence first as the duo could raise the defence of not being qualified. It is a clearly a case of negligence on the duo's part.
"Now another COI, this time all party are involve in it for it investigation. if you heard from what he said. Like what some comment here are, telling the people Mindef is never wrong and as to move on, but as the defend minster, just it reason he was qualify to carry out those duty. Now we what for COI story. Not from himself how to avoid further incident, where are the measure in place for such training incident. Feel sorry for those who had lost their love one."
"No one in mindef is holding responsible for Pang death as if nothing has happened .
Minister in charge also not accepting responsible .
All simple to say look into safety first ."
NS is a waste of innocent lives. Loss of lives because of NS will never stop as long as there is NS.
why the 2 men not allowed to speak to the press?
"INSOFAR .....///.... What you have hear from those with access and putting the news out or making statements are nothing more than Lip Service served to assure and mortify those in command along with the processes including the supposed trained abilities of those in their respective role responsibilities ......

The statement made upon the incident or accident has been all controlled to make available news to the public that are palatable in snippets and also to show cause the efforts made to save a life ..the live of a Singapore Son ....none knows the Truth and only hears the Hard Truth .......

If one remembers the case of a leak photo about an accident or incident of armour vehicle and the vid or photos found its way to public space ....the publisher was traced ....criminalised for this .....and those involved are well protected ....The G is all out to muffled any Truth but will release only Hard Truth .....Hear Good News ....only news fit for public consumption that will further consolidate and protect the Million Dollar Self-Given Dignity Ministers .....

the leak and compromised data by SingHealth ....any Heads Roll?....the head honcho just make Lip Service statement and continue ....,,, GKY should be long gone along with NEH .....this G needs a wake up call next GE ....only in the opposite fence will we uncover the Truth and unravel the Hard Truth ...What do you think?."
"There is still no mention how better trained/equipped people will be sent to resume the incomplete repair safely? We all still in the dark, as no one has any idea what to do?"
round and round.so what is the answer? tsk tsk tsk
"The statement from the minister just state that the people operating it all all well trained all fully qualify and the equipment meeting international standard why don’t he just said that mindef is not wrong it is the act of god that is the message I got
Sick of it"
"THIS GOV IS NO MORE, NOW."
"After talking so long, I am only interested what led to A. Pang""s death? There is no conclusion at all."
"Flick Rammer? Its purpose is to ram somebody?

Why no safety feature designed around this ""Rammer""?"
"Dr Ng, ur script are well written & its we already anticipated it. We want to know who is at fault & any head going to roll? Or we get u rolled in the nxt election"
"So many commentators saying,""Procedures were in place, so many others trained without accident, so who was at fault?""

Unfortunately, Pang made a mistake, and it was unfortunately his fault. He had been through 6 other exercises after NS, he's not exactly a newbie. Sometimes accidents occur and people pay for it with their lives."
"Why so many focus on small things like the tank instead on NS policies? Such deaths would have been less if SAF is manned by full timers. U cannot expect reservists who are like casual labour to be as competent, right?"
What is worse... The defense minister is also similarly qualified to get to the source of the problem
"More ""ownself check ownself, oneself clear ownself"". Not one minister or paper general ever resigned. The stench of PAP is strong in this one. Try to appear white outside, but already tainted inside."
Greatest regret no one got to ask Mr Pang what truly happened that day when he is still conscious ..now that he's gone the real truth is forever buried with him as those alive and needs to account may or may not be forthcoming with the Truth
"Israeli tanks are made with engine in front to give maximum protection to occupants, here is a man still arguing the clean record till one man is killed. And how other armies are using the same lousy methodology. The problems here is analogy to the spade of problem with SMRT."
"What I felt was left out is there hours of training, the long flight from Singapore to another place, the hours of sleep these trainees had...it is usual for them to wake up early in the morning,trained till late night and starts again early the next morning. It is the lack of sleep that gives rise to late of concentration, resulting to lapses of safety procedures."
"Dude every time a service man died or injured due to negligence, a Minister in Charge have to resigned? Any wonder the name to Tofu Army? amid that this domain still calls for the 'offensive' against Msia whereby soldiers therein lack the statue to defend, let alone fight, even in peace time death? The Minister even Commanders are surely no whining boys, no? and they are responsible for every 'soldier' lives?"
safety come first
"What happened to common sense of putting alarm or flash light? LOL Who designed thethe vehicle? No real scientist but anyhow design to save cost.

Things that can be seen is easier to build but things that cannot be seen is harder to build. That's why our society so many problems. All built by selfish noobies"
I also have friends who died while on active service in my older days. Never heard any SG big wicks mentioned them in the parliment or take responsibility. Why now?
"It seems that in the SSPH, the commander also has the duties of the gunner (hence the SAF termed him a Gun Commander). While this saved on manpower and likely design constraints, it also means that the commander is LESS aware of what the rest of the crew in the cabin are doing, since he could be attending to operating the gun controls instead of COMMANDING the operation in the vehicle."
"Let us face the truth. Rather difficult for the COI if the people involved all say no idea what went wrong. We can blame the deceased as an alibi, to sweep under the carpet. But similar accidents forth-coming, like our repeated train breakdowns, and any alibi. Ideally could be like what Suharto did for Indonesia:- step down."
If there is a buddy assigned for such dangerous work like it’s mandatory in Scuba diving...more lives will be saved even during war
It will be AHTC fault again.
"How did Aloysius get crushed by the barrel ? I'm sorry, it seems his death is cause by the negligence of himself and all the soldiers present in the Howitzer.
No amount of procedures can save any solider if they don't follow through."
"Being qualified is one thing, being mindful of what one is doing is another."
"need so many MP to debate on this?? the SSPH has operated so many years with no such related incidents.. sorry to say, but likely Aloy forgot about the procedures and stood in the way of the lowering gun.."
"everyone is trained, armor tank is okay. so ""lets move on"" ?"
"Bla bla blah... T0P man still not removed and he is still trying to shift bIame.
Still N0 ACC0UNTABILITY except lip-service, so lets wait for NEXT Accident... Again.

After his ParLEEment wayang sh0w ended, he will ask his paper generals:
""Hey, what's for lunch today? I'm famished after all the talking."" Hrr hrhr hr."
It's long overdue I mean U as a Ageing Doctor...cmon get lost
"To Everyone in this Website, Especially PAP, Opposition Parties & All Singaporean,

TREAT the Death of our soldiers as Dead Stray Dogs & Dead Stray Cats that we sometime found on the Street and DON’T FEEL PAINFUL of it . . .

This is what is described in Chinese words of such mindsets :==>>

死的是别人的儿子 ，又不是自己亲人 ，当然不心疼呀 。。。当做是死了野狗和野猫在街上就是了 。。。

“ Accept & let him go in peace “ as highlight by Aloysius Pang’s brother & Aloysius Pang’s mentor, Dasmond Koh, on Aloysius Pang’s death in army training in New Zealand, is just like that , TREAT the Life & Death of our NSF soldiers & NSmen so VERY, VERY, VERY DIRT CHEAP until cannot DIRT CHEAP any more .

It like even if many thousands of Singaporean have died senselessly & terribly , it is also very, very, very OK at all, by certain people that held important positions in Singapore . . .

Seem to want to INTENTIONALLY & PURPOSELY to IGNORE the whole Big Problems & Sweep the whole Big Problems under carpet again & go on with life, as though nothing has happened & life goes on as usual ! ! !

Is that how our “ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ should behave ? ? ?

It really give us an impression that many Key Civil Servants in Singapore Civil Service , which is regarded internationally as the “ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WORLD “ , are more interested in to EARN the FREE & EASY HIGH SALARIES & also, EARN the FREE & EASY , SWEET-OFF COMFORTABLE LIFE in their WORK PLACES than truly want to work hard & swear hard to serve the people . . . . , ADDICT to COMFORT ZONE & refuse to come out from such EASY-GOING LIFE at all .

Really set a very BAD EXAMPLE to Singaporean people & the whole world , if that is the case , & very WORST , seem to INTENTIONALLY & PURPOSELY do that too . . .

Something is terribly WRONG with the “ DEEP-ROOTED CORPORATE CULTURE “ & “ DEEP-ROOTED SOCIAL CULTURE “ in our “ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WORLD “, which seem to have gone wrong for many years, BUT , seem to Purposely IGNORE by our“ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WORLD “ over many years . . .

OR, should say , simply REFUSE to even take action to prevent such tragedies from happening, like set up special , powerful , completely independent military law enforcement agencies to deal with such problems , in which ordinary low level law enforcement officers are often unable or even too scare to handle . . .

[ Such agencies worked LIKE the American version of JAG or CPIB / CID in the Singapore Arm Forces & SCDF , to investigate POTENTIAL MURDER , ATTEMPT MURDER , ABUSE of POWER , PULLING RANKS , CORRUPTION , POWER PLAY , CHEATING , EMPLOYERS any how SACK NSmen from their jobs for their NS Training , or intentionally DISCRIMINATE NSmen in their jobs for their obligation to NS & etc. .

Very IMPORTANTLY , We need such very Specially trained, very Professionally Committed , very Ethically Upright Law Enforcement Agencies that literally behave like Real Justice Bao / 包青天 & are absolutely FREE from all Political Influences & External Pressures from self-interest groups to deal with such very cunning , bad people , BUT , BUT , so far, there is very few such people exist in SAF or any where in Singapore yet ]

Really need more “ FIREMAN “ type of Ministers, like Dr Khaw Boon Wah & even Mr Shanmugan, to CLEAN UP , make full HOUSE CLEANING ( Chinese mean : 清理门户 ) & RESTRUCTURE all the MESS that have happened in our“ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ & even Private Sector , BUT , need still quite reliable Non-PAP political leaders, like Mr Mr Low Thia Khiang & now, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, & also NEUTRAL Singapore Judiciary System to MONITOR & CONTROL the action & behaviour of Top Civil Servants, to press such cases to happen . . .

Don't you ALL in this WEBSITE THINK so ? ? ?

Any COMMENTS from you PEOPLE out there ? ? ?"
"I might be jumping the gun but from Hen's expression, it seems that the other 2 managed to escape in time while Pang was trapped with disastrous end? So.much for brotherhood when disastrous death is real."
"Please Sir, Minister of Defense. Resign lah. Your Ministerial Statement is as good as don't say anything. Not that you need to look for another job or having a hard time to make ends meet. You collected a lot already. Time to let someone else take over. Maybe that person will fare worst than you. Then huh, you look good in history books. Today, you will go down in history as a Minister of Defense that so many people HATE."
Easy for him to say that when the death isn't in his family.
Very Very straight forward. Every Singaporean will be able to understand me. The mechanism was faulty and Aloysius Pang died from the negligence of the SAF equipment. That's all.
"Amazingly, whenever incidents like this occur, its never the fault of the army. When a camp mate of mine many years ago died of heat stroke, its his fault for not hydrating himself. They dont take into account if the weather is too hot, whether the rest period is too short, whether the route march is too long n far. we are all not born with the same fitness, some can handle the toughness, others might not be able to endure too long. Long story short, gov is always right, we can only keep quiet n complain in forums like this, pathetic."
"The truth is, they lowered the gun barrel while Pang was standing right behind the gun. Therefore, safety procedure have not be followed and complied."
How about 0.05 death in training related incident in the past century?
Wonder who is the SAF force commander for thunder warrior ex
My after thought: two more similar deaths if those two survivors not re-deployed elsewhere. That is a positive preventive measure. Approved this action.
"The good thing about this government is that it always got an excuse for every wrong it committed. Seriously, if it is willing to humble itself and admit its weaknesses and that it is just made up of normal hman being that can make mistakes people would definitely understand and even support it in the face of crises."
"Dont always blame the SAF for any accident happening. Past and Present is so greatly different that Safety and Welfare is top priority. Is just that the people when in Green has to play their role just like when they are in Civilian.
Never take thing for Granted !.
1. Bionix case - Safety instinct that the Land rover driver and the trainer should have run/jump out of the Rover. Trainer as a regular should know the safety aspect to execute the evacuation order. Just like when you are in a car and a lorry is reversing or roll back towards you..cant possibly you just SIT IN.
2. Howitzer case - Dried run and refresher course on the safety aspect when inside the chamber are always enforced when one is on active or reservist service. The Green man has to play their role unless they think ooh..Lao-Chiao cannot happen to me.

Dont make safety changes as such that video comm is needed to get approval from control centre to proceed.

My advise to active and pro-active NSmen dont take Safety procedure for Granted. You decide your fate or how to change course instantly."
"For what is worth, this poor guy is dead. Whatever the reasons given, Pang will not return. SAF need to accept they are at faultcas a life had been lost.... whatever the explanations given are mere excuses!"
"To me, the ministerial statement by minister reveals nothing new. Its a pathetic show of false concern of the safety of our NS men"
"dont tak cock la, no coverage or public discussion of previous incidents, now that the media blew it up, suddenly everybody is concerned. wayang maximum"
The Minister is just reading out aloud from the findings. Thats about it. Its not his responsibility and neither his ministry?
"Highly qualified P@P MPs & Me-nisters never take blame, want lowly qualified NSmen to?"
"""BLOOD SHED""!!!...and a surgeon MINDEAF HEN is supposed to ""save"" lives, but this HEN did otherwise and said ""SORRY""?... chut pattern just like a DISHONOURABLE SON's ""Sorry...I'll do better next time"" after devastating GE2011?

If HEN or any PAPig minister's ""white horse son"" die in NSF, will a ""LATE SORRY"" be enough closure?... and no minister to take responsibility to resign?

Remember how then Lt. LiHongYi breached SAF Laws, and how panicky AhChan was to quickly find excuse to ""pardon"" him against ""court marshalled""?

A DISHONOURABLE SON's ""white horse"" was well-protected, but lives of young sons of ""MEDIOCRE"" SINGAPOREANS are dispensable?"
"Maybe...its murder?the other 2 guys holding him down while the apparatus slowly (9 secs) came down on him crushing him?

Nah..the deceased would have said so as he was conscious /aware before his dead right?...fishy though..why was he under it?"
"Let us hope others sent to resume the incomplete repair, are better trained/equipped for the job, in order to avoid further accidents."
Keep haroing on experience...how many times done this or that but still noninfo on cause be it humannor machibe. What 8s the use of taliking about pp having loads of exoetience then someine dead right...sigh...clueless...may as well blame on ghost or natural disaster...the family needs closure so watch cctv and see what hapoens...no..no cctv...alemak?
"Murphy's law when it could happen, it will happen when given enough time. There will be more death unless there is a redesign. What a fools endeavour when the politicians it treating this issue as a political issues."
If one were to watch the gun lowering & gun raising video. it was unfortunate that Aloysius was at the wrong place at the wrong time. He was not at the correct safe position as per SOP.
"Kiang Jiu Ho, Mai Ge Kiang. get it."
"Talk so much. Just Sack this so call Minister. Talk untill the cow come home, still TALKING."
Way too many NS related deaths.
Who cares!
"I mean....""lack of concentration""....and ""...in lapses of safety procedures""."
"Useless to talk and explain, just tell everyone why and how it happened...... Where are emergency stop buttons in cabin?"
Kaka puiiii
"During the lowering of the gun, prrsonnel in cabin are supposedly to be in ""safe positions"", apparently the crushed victim was then in an unsafe position. How was it so has not as yet been explained. Why?"
"Looking at the video inside the machine, wonder how he can be caught and crushed?"
Yawn yawn...
How come 2 other persons didn't communicate with each other or act blur ?? Sabotaged ? American say Leave no man behind. Here say leave man behind.
No safety features design on these vehicles...?
Send our army to Israel for training.
Nothing to do with qualification. It is purely due to neglience.
Unsure why most of them still cant get it. Any more obvious the dead will have to acknowledge his own negligence. Notice no promotion of rank as well? Period.
"Aloysius, died, commander safe himself"
Every single one death is somebody’s Son. The way Mindef treat these death as a number. No one in Mindef will bother as Long as the number is Low and not zero
He should quit and not looking for excuse.
"If in a persons watch there is multiple casualties over a period of time.
He or she has to go. ""Kill the chicken to scare the monkey""...
Leaders must have exceptional qualities otherwise miseries follow suit..."
"""He suffered crush injuries to his chest and abdomen on 19 January ...""
19 January, already investigated, recorded what happened > better cover up first.
20 January review investigation and records > better continue cover up.
21 January review again investigation and records > cover up and tell public still under investigation.
... ... Public is stupid, sure believe us the Army.
Of cos on 20 Jan a video can be release how the gun barrel works, and how it
was manned and operates from years of training... but let's wait til 11 Feb then make a show after the heal blew over. Army congratulating one another with every cover up incidents."
"Are PaP QUALIFIED

"US Army said Humvee good. After they deployed it for war in the Middle East, then confessed Humvee no good if there is enemy. US soldiers keep getting killed with usage of the Humvee. Looks like the same for us. All good, until when there is any problem, all no good."
Can you just explain how he actually died? Or need more time to cover up?
Ng E H is a mediocre.
The buddy of most people these days are their handphones which should be banned during all exercise.

"This case will be forever until the next one. Accident happens anytime and anywhere even at home if you are not careful. How about his parents, are they suing the government for his death? If no news from them meaning they know the answer but would not share with the public, too sensitive and embarrassing. If not confirm they had already engaged a reputable lawyer right? Used your common sense , the government will not expose the other 2 guys indentity, too dangerous!! What if that 2 person is related to you? Why always asked when the ministers going to step down and talked about their salary each time something happen? Why always talk about money? Use your common sense people! Just because he is a celebrity!! Get someone to make this a movie so that we will know the answer. Just wish you would be able to wake up from sleep the next day and be thankful that you are still alive or die in your sleep so your family will blame who if that happen? What is the meaning of accident, hmmmm?"

"Well.

Think about time to do something about this. The seaman was detained by Malaysian authorities, why didn't Singapore exercise their power since it was in our waters. Does this means that Singapore is recognizing that is Malaysian territory. This is serious.I hope our government can clarify the facts ASAP before people starts jumping into conclusion."
"In my opinion, sgp government should bear some responsibility towards this incident for not taking a stronger stance in controlling our territory! If we claim this is our territory we should ensure safety of vessels passing thru it.. this is a reputational risk for us"
"Wow, notice something?
P@P govt allow Malaysian govt to detain the Greek vessel & crew for what happened in S'pore's waters. Will P@P govt allow Malaysian police or other authorities to come to S'pore to flex their powers?"
"Why the Malaysian vessel, Polaris, is not detained by our Coast Guard yet?"

We need change the system...Vote out the ruling party...They have done too much damage to the country.......EARN HIGHEST DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE THE BEST"
Many thanks to our Greek Brothers !

"'Currently moored at the port of Tanjung Pelepas, the Piraeus and its crew have also been detained by Malaysian authorities for questioning.' Shouldn't we ask Minister if Spore has given up control to Malaysia ? We should be the one apprehending, arresting and questioning since it was in our waters ! $1 million Ministers better wake up !"
Should demand from Malaysia to hand over the Greek seamen since this happens within our territory. Not doing anything means we implicitly handing over control to Malaysia.

"Someone enters your house with your knowledge but not approval and then raped your visitors. That's the scenario here. By all counts if the police is not called in and the intruder not arrested, then the host would be in gross negligence. Singapore should sue Malaysia for this incident and make Mahathir pay till he goes bankrupt before he lies in his coffin in disgrace."

"Why do we allow mudlaysia government vessel to intrude into our waters again? If we had stopped their entry, this would not have happened."
So fast declare that it is Singapore Water? Can Yahoo be a bit more neutral when reporting?
"Instead of doing the right thing to exert our sovereignty, all we do is to plea with the intruder not to 'persist' in entering our waters!!! Sg is not what we or others think that we are."
I agree LKY would have taken it very differently... the son is weak.
Malaysia Hates Singapore ( or at least their PM does) . War is coming soon ! Watch out people!
"There are some things in life that you don't sit and patiently watch. Someone intruding your wife/gf is one, some country intruding your country is another."
I feel Sg should exercise patience before jumping into conclusions
Unfortunately the creek ship didn't sink that bolehland ship
I think they discovered that SG port was so expensive that they try to run away as fast as possible to Tanjung Pelepas....but couldn't stop in time and bump into the Malaysian vessel.
"P@P leadersheep is ""world class"", & their graciousness to Malusiah is sending the signal that S'poreans are good to bully."
Time for serious action.
"The Singapore Government are now very weak, unable to have a meaning dialogue with Dr. Mahathir when he just took over control of the Malaysian Government. This may be attributed to the quarreling over the 38 Oxley Road premises which took away so much time and resources of our nation problems and indeed have no time to deal with the issues with our Malaysian counterparts."
"I thought our gahmen very rigid and it's always law-by-law towards its citizen? Why neber law-by=law and sink that malaysian vessel? Scared ah? Dare bully individual dun dare take up bigger opponent ah?

Humji izzit?"
$500 says the vessel wasnt anchored
"Aiya look at the causeway, how many Singaporeans are going over to buy things, only reason because it's cheaper than Sg, so why not give and take,,, we still need Malaysia for lots of things"
"It is time for Sgp to take immediate action against MY intrusion vessels, detect their vessels and prosecute them for violation. Our water safety is now being compromised by MY vessels. Action please. Enough of talking, never trust Dr M the Prata King."
So happy !
So big sea so big ships still accident...purposely is it
"We still need Water, and work force from them, and we should have some gratitude"
"Indecisiveness on the part of P@P govt puts SG's reputation at an attractive shipping hub at risk. As with many govt agencies, not sending clear signals will cause confusion. The longer issues are not resolved, the worse it will be.

Such damage to S'pore's reputation is worse than what bloggers & cartoonists can do. Yet, because elites are the cause of it, no action is taken?"
If LKY is around he will do - see Lee Kuan Yew versus the SIA Strikers
"These r exciting times, looks like S'pore is sliding down a spiral it cannot get out of. Wad to do? The majority of dumb local born like it.

The people get the govt they deserve. Karma!"
"If you ask me and my opinion is still arrest the ship and put the ship in locked area and let the Court settle the fight. If they use military power, our navy have to come in force and see what step it takes. Is all about leadership and Singapore just do not have that means to be great leader."

(PS: This is a translation version from the old Chinese Classic written more than two thousand years ago. This translation work was done and scripted by the child who was a Primary School dropout and condemned to work at our Animals' Farm for many years until adulthood.)
The war ships our Malaysian counterparts anchored in our Singapore waters was a deliberate attempt to test the patience, the ability, our resoluteness and determination to deal with this matter. The prolonged agony of our fellow Singaporeans is understandable as the Malaysian political leaders under Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohammed knew the current Singapore leaders are very weak and incapable to face the issues before them. This was despite the fact the Cabinet and all the other Government Agencies and Government linked Companies under the Temasek Holdings portfolios are swarmed with many Army Generals
within their ranks. There is no point for our civilian Ministers to continuing taking steps talking to them about diplomacy. They knew our weaknesses. Singapore political leaders do have no courage to fire the first salvos at them as our current political leaders have no heart and love to govern and serve the country and people but only wanted to serve themselves despite the fact many Singaporeans are living below poverty line. Indeed, the Malaysians Government are now playing 'a cat and mouse waiting game'. (2) Our poor Foreign Minister and Minister for Defence currently were unable to do anything to defuse the 'burning issues' despite the fact, we have seen not a single Army Generals stepping forward to help the two gentlemen. Neither were our very top leaders and Rear-Admirals. Unilaterally, Singapore cannot alone submitted our case to the International Court of Justice in Hague the same like the Philippines Government under President Aquino. We should never expect some other country leaders in our neighbourhood to help us shout at Malaysia 'to follow and abide by the International law of the Sea'."

As for Malaysia, Singapore very scare of Dr.M that;s why LHL dare not give order to detain Malaysia Vessel.
Lousy Greek , You are nothing to our Singapore PAP. Now, Greek what can you do ? Do you dare ask Singapore why detain your and never detain Malaysia Vessel ?
Greek, Be careful, Our LHL love to give lawsuit, Lousy Greek better be careful. LOL"

All thanks to the Greek ship that knocked into the Malaysia mind. To make them wake their up blood idea....
"Time to wipe them out of singapore water, waiting for what?"
"This is called karma warning for illegal parking. A real karma will be when the huge vessel sinks the Malaysia ship. imagine when the mega Tuas Port is completed, the whole place will be full of ships calling at the port. Mahathir is obviously trying to frustrate the construction of the Tuas Port. Stupid idea because the growth of Tuas Port will have a rub-on effect on Tg Pelapas to make it grow bigger like they built oil storage in east coast Pengeran to capitalise on Jurong industrial Estate, Southern petro-chemical islands and Changi Airport. Singapore should not build any 3rd link on the east coast because it only helps to develop that ulu area."
"Simple lah. Charge all Greek damages plus demurrage to the Malaysian Government. If don't pay, seize Malaysian ships in Spore waters, starting with Polaris !"
Congratulations Malaysia.. h ha
"M dislikes Spore, he wants to bully Spore"
Malaysian pigs hit by mighty Hercules! Ha ha ha ! Long lived the Greeks ! Hellenic Air Force!
The minister said...we must be level headed and keep calm....there's already an accident...how long will u be keeping calm when an illegal foreign ship is in your so call country border and got into an accident...other time u catch illegals u cane them....

Told them to move their ask holes don’t want to listen. Malay pigs are stupid. Now you know why S$1=RM3 ?? Yes pigs are stupid.
Hope no one got injured by the stupid decision of Dr. M.
Crazy. The is just the stupidest comment here
"If the smell is not from haze , then is what , NEA should investigate further , if not what is NEA is for ?"
"If we lack expertise in identify the sources of air pollution, abilities to analyze the air samples, please hire, train, etc.

Everytime got funny smell in the air, we got all the funny answers like nothing significant, nothing much, don't know where are the sources?! PMI = ok that kind of thing. If this happens to be toxic, will the PMI increase or stay normal range?

What kind of joke is this? Everytime same answer."
"Shall we tie the NEA officials to stakes and leave them overnight to breath in the 'fresh air' so that they can experience it for themselves ? Send the NEA officials to the field with hand-held data loggers and investigate, instead of sitting in the office 'crafting polite politically-correct replies' and remotely monitoring their sensors via computers !"
"I was woken up at 7:00 from the strong smell of burning wood. I looked outside, and the haze blocked my view of Batam. NEA reported the haze is not local or transboundary haze. It had to come from somewhere."
This report might as well be written as: haze smell in eastern Singapore. NEA could not identify where smell is from. That’s it. A 2 sentence report that says it all.
"Doesn't mean PMI2.5, the air is not toxic. NEA should add in how toxicity the air quality is."
"Not local source, but foreign source! The annual n seasonal ""haze"" in NorthEast of Singapore possibly comes from burning in ""incineration chimney"" at Punggol Point/Beach!!!... even Sengkang/Punggol goes through this ""smell"" at year-end of beginning of year!"
Never believe smoke haze data from NEA
Never trust fully what the gov or gov agencies say. Rmb they are not a charitable organization. They smile u smile. They say hi u say hi. They say something dont believe 100%.
"Maybe this is how S'pore will be attacked? Anyone remember a few years ago got chemical odour from the north, but source cannot be traced?"
"By failing to identify the source, I think the government has failed in its duty, so much wayang for other stunts"
"incense sticks, joss papers contributed the air pollution"
"NEA is clearly incompetent if it cannot even detect source of smell. I only know Jurong industrial estate include Tuas factories are polluting the air for Jurong West residents. Seems like NEA close two eyes, deliberately compromising residents' health for whatever reasons. Getting sinus everyday."
No haze detected? NEA sure or not?
"SMART - Singapore MIT Alliance group did research on bus stop fumes; Duke-NUS did research on viruses in our MRT system. Eg. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/air-samples-collected-on-mrt-rides-to-detect-and-monitor-viruses-duke-nus-study

NEA still fighting dengue at Bedok Reservoir for so many weeks already. The release of mutant mosquito to fight dengue mosquitoes doesn't work?

We can collect the air samples from various parts of Singapore. Who to analyze the samples for traces of toxic components?? HSA? DSTA Chemical Dept? NEA? SCDF Hazmat group?

Even when someone collapse after smelling the polluted air, there is no concrete evidence COD is the gas.

Please advise."
"Does this mean if someone burns something outside Singapore, more than half our reservists cannot report to camps safely? Some can already pengsan?

If so, please issue Gas Masks to all reservists."
Can PM2.5 be normal when the gas is toxic?
Not caused by local sources? So NEA knows where it comes from right?
Could the source come from Pasir Gudang?
"If we all give our bosses this kind of reply, next day don't have to turn up for work already.

So, NEA got very good working environment siah!

Any job openings? How to apply?"
"I live in Kembangan and I could literally see
the HAZE for THREE STRAIGHT NIGHTS and the smell was so bad it was CHOKING. N.E.A. ARE LYING!!!"
No wonder so many heart attacks in the early morning due to this unexplained source
Why never show ahneh ceca bui in the poster pic?
"We can still smell the smog intermittently. If Msian govt cannot extinguish the fire till now, can we help them?
By helping them, we also help ourselves to prevent further health problems."
"NEA works on a reactive basis. Even when people on the ground are smelling the burnt air, they still maintained that they ""have not detected any local sources of burning or factory upsets that could have contributed to the smell"".

Only now then they managed to find the cause. I donno what to say."
So many smokers in east side.
Maim culprit is the vehicle carbon emission where many including vehicle owners n govt failed to recognize
"today, 4-5 am, at macpherson area, it smells like heavy chlorine. very difficult to breathe while trying to fall asleep again."
Chinese new year ... China burn paper money .. now then smell come here ... hahaha
"Suggest to build up our ""AIR"" defense. i.e set up detectors to monitor the quality of air in different parts of Singapore. Not just PM2.5, PM10, but also harmful toxic gases, etc.

We will never know whether the sources are internal (infiltration) or external (coastal areas). Eg, some sick guys burning toxic compounds in remote parts of Singapore.

Immediately, we can zoom in and tackle the air pollution and/or sue the person/factory."
It's the smell of karma. Bad omen coming... Election and pap win... KARMA
"Told ya; go eco-friendly. Ban plastics, fossil fuels, pesticides, insecticides, artificial air fresheners etc.

Introduce biodegradable alternatives. Humans are dying like poor giraffes in the animal prison misleadingly named as 'zoo.'

But cuz the diagnosis is the general 'heart failure' and cuz deaths happen gradually, no link is suspected."
"Worse daily happening at my Sengkang home, there's daily smokey pollutant from the ""incence burning"" from neighbour....unheathy toxic inhalant."
one celebrity needs to be sacrifice before NEA is willing to setup independent committee to investigate.
Air pollution is a slow silent killer nea will not be faulted
Likely due to car n vehicle exhausts
the most unbearable smell on the road is those exhaust from bio diesel cabs or lorries...
First they breach the waters and now they send over smoke. Is this not a clear signal to Singaporeans how weak and unrespectable the current Sg 'leaders' are in the eyes of other countries?
"Coe should be taxed much higher to ler drivers know they are the source of health hazard if they don't change to electric vehicles, this should be led swiftly by the government"
"No flood, just ponding"
NEA go find out and you uttered rubbish here. Instead of sneakily hiding around on 1st day of Chinese New Year issuing public fines. Such a low.
"burning since 5 feb, nea dont even know."
It's the smell of burning dirty oil.
讲鸟话.sure got things burning.
don't hear any news about that fire. sure or not.
"Alamak, should have said they know which country but will not reveal it."
"I was expecting the PM to say that as long as the haze comes from any country and not originating from Singapore, it is definitely healthy for Singaporeans to breathe in, Just like more Singaporean are criminals compared to foreigners as he said."
Still have the smell intermittently. Don't stand down.
How can don't have haze? then why woman cover up all her face? nb
fart from the man above?
"Its like somebody pang chow pui. Not me, not you, then who?"
it could be a smelly gas released by malaysia or indonesia.. beware of their new petty tactics..

"An independent Safety consultant group should be form permanently.
They must not have active SAF personnels in it.
This safety group must have the power to report all forms of non-conformity irregardless of which high ranking officers that have flout the safety rules.
This group should have the power like CPIB (Corrupt Practice Investigation Bureau)
Just look at the oil & marine sectors.
Their safety standards are so much higher.
They have external safety consultants who are not afraid to report any safety breach & dare to recommend all necessary appropriate measures.
I recommend to the government to form a special branch of safety officers whom has already completed ALL their NS liability (so as not to be influence or intimidated).
They must not have any links or business dealings with SAF's other organisation ie. Safra, ST, DSO etc.
Last but not least, these safety officers MUST be Singaporeans for national security & they must not be ex-military commissioned officers.
With this, I can bet that the safety standards of the SAF will be professionally elevated & the so-called SAF ""scholars"" will have to really proof themselves & not expect everything will to be covered up or their career to be guaranteed.
PEACE."
Any MP ask about the relevance of NS pllicies? Given that the true blue low income males suffer the most from not being able to work off site & FW policies still favour employers.
"The Defence Minister has to step down. Only when actor died, big wayang drama. How about all the rest who died ? Bionix, heat-stroke etc etc.. BOI & COI carefully lah.. the 4 Sgt in Guardsman heat exhaustion case got questioned or not ? Did they hinder the Medic application of SOP on victim ? How can Safety LandRover be so near the Bionix ? SPG gun being lowered, there is no shout-out or check before lowering ?

"The questions are also designed for the Govt to answer yes yes yes we have procedures in place, we review regularly, but we can do better.. so till the next death do us talk again. The real question should be- there is obviously weaknesses/ lapses in procedures to prevent SAF training deaths Regardless of all the Motherhood statements which then ministers will blah blah blah out, the incidents clearly show that procedures are inadequate. So where are the lapses, how could these happen, who is supposed to ensure the overall effectiveness of these procedures and who should now be held accountable, and what REALLY is going to be done (not some useless comittee of inquiry) to prevent future incidents."

Jobs wise, it given towards foreigners and Singaporeans are reporting foreigners as their Head of Dept.

"To Everyone in this Website, Especially PAP, Opposition Parties & All Singaporean,

TREAT the Death of our soldiers as Dead Stray Dogs & Dead Stray Cats that we sometime found on the Street and DON’T FEEL PAINFUL of it . . .

This is what is described in Chinese words of such mindsets :==>>

死的是别人的儿子 ，又不是自己亲人 ，当然不心疼呀 。。。当做是死了野狗和野猫在街上就是了 。。。

“ Accept & let him go in peace “ as highlight by Aloysius Pang’s brother & Aloysius Pang’s mentor, Dasmond Koh, on Aloysius Pang’s death in army training in New Zealand, is just like that , TREAT the Life & Death of our NSF soldiers & NSmen so VERY, VERY, VERY DIRT CHEAP until cannot DIRT CHEAP any more .

It like even if many thousands of Singaporean have died senselessly & terribly , it is also very, very, very OK at all, by certain people that held important positions in Singapore . . .

Seem to want to INTENTIONALLY & PURPOSELY to IGNORE the whole Big Problems & Sweep the whole Big Problems under carpet again & go on with life, as though nothing has happened & life goes on as usual ! ! !

Is that how our “ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ should behave ? ? ?

It really give us an impression that many Key Civil Servants in Singapore Civil Service , which is regarded internationally as the “ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WORLD “ , are more interested in to EARN the FREE & EASY HIGH SALARIES & also, EARN the FREE & EASY , SWEET-OFF COMFORTABLE LIFE in their WORK PLACES than truly want to work hard & swear hard to serve the people . . . . , ADDICT to COMFORT ZONE & refuse to come out from such EASY-GOING LIFE at all .

Really set a very BAD EXAMPLE to Singaporean people & the whole world , if that is the case , & very WORST , seem to INTENTIONALLY & PURPOSELY do that too . . .

Something is terribly WRONG with the “ DEEP-ROOTED CORPORATE CULTURE “ & “ DEEP-ROOTED SOCIAL CULTURE “ in our “ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WORLD “, which seem to have gone wrong for many years, BUT , seem to Purposely IGNORE by our“ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WORLD “ over many years . . .

OR, should say , simply REFUSE to even take action to prevent such tragedies from happening, like set up special , powerful , completely independent military law enforcement agencies to deal with such problems , in which ordinary low level law enforcement officers are often unable or even too scare to handle . . .

[ Such agencies worked LIKE the American version of JAG or CPIB / CID in the Singapore Arm Forces & SCDF , to investigate POTENTIAL MURDER , ATTEMPT MURDER , ABUSE of POWER , PULLING RANKS , CORRUPTION , POWER PLAY , CHEATING , EMPLOYERS any how SACK NSmen from their jobs for their NS Training , or intentionally DISCRIMINATE NSmen in their jobs for their obligation to NS & etc. .

Very IMPORTANTLY , We need such very Specially trained, very Professionally Committed , very Ethically Upright Law Enforcement Agencies that literally behave like Real Justice Bao / 包青天 & are absolutely FREE from all Political Influences & External Pressures from self-interest groups to deal with such very cunning , bad people , BUT , BUT , so far, there is very few such people exist in SAF or any where in Singapore yet ]

Really need more “ FIREMAN “ type of Ministers, like Dr Khaw Boon Wah & even Mr Shanmugan, to CLEAN UP , make full HOUSE CLEANING ( Chinese mean : 清理门户 ) & RESTRUCTURE all the MESS that have happened in our“ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ & even Private Sector , BUT , need still quite reliable Non-PAP political leaders, like Mr Mr Low Thia Khiang & now, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, & also NEUTRAL Singapore Judiciary System to MONITOR & CONTROL the action & behaviour of Top Civil Servants, to press such cases to happen . . .

Don't you ALL in this WEBSITE THINK so ? ? ?

Any COMMENTS from you PEOPLE out there ? ? ?"
Looks this time they're leaving the wayang airtime to unknown PAP MPs.....otherwise how to vote if we don't even know or remember their existence.... lol.....
"Wayang wayang only. Ministers son No die, all Bo Chap"
Where is the Risk assessment and safety committee? They should follow the same procedure as the public sector
"Things will never improve so long as the Press and the Judiciary keep protecting their fellow crooked elites. Rogue judiciary has been endorsing the trampling for decades through subtle apartheid.

Many more sons and daughters will suffer the fate of Aloyzius Pang so long as miscreants Judges like Chan Seng Onn, Woo Bi Li, Belinda Ang, Lee Seu Kin, Tay Yong Kwang, Tan Siong Thai and so many others are sycophants of the miscreant politicians especially the Health Minister and his officials, and protect them with full blessings of their Court of Appeal."
i was a 6yr sign-on airforce techician. i remember my very respectable warrant officer did give an advice 10yrs ago. That senior officers are lacking good advice and council in their organisation policy and decisions. This can only overcome by retaining a good number of well experienced senior staff.

"To Everyone in this Website, Especially PAP, Opposition Parties & All Singaporean,

ABUSE of POWER here , ABUSE of POWER there , DOUBLE STANDARD here , DOUBLE STANDARD there , behave in IRRESPONSIBLE way in here , behave in IRRESPONSIBLE way in there . . . . . . . . This is what is all about . . .

From this website that mention of the recent Death of NSman, Aloysius Pang, & other deaths in SAF & Civil Defence due to lethal accidents, which seem to be cause by ABUSE of POWER & ACTS of IRRESPONSIBILITY by their bad officers & irresponsible comrades, it has EXPOSE OUT these BIG PROBLEMS in SAF, Civil Defence & many government agencies . . .

These are the BIG PROBLEMS in SAF for many years , a “ DEEP-ROOTED CULTURE “ that our “ MOST EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ has Purposely IGNORE for many years , or simply DON’T CARE at all in the 1st place . . .

[ * * * NOTE :==>> After the Unhappy Event on Flooding in Bishan MRT station that was caused by FALSIFICATION of maintenance record by key SMRT maintenance staff & SMRT CEO, Mr Desmond Kuek, BLAME it on “ DEEP-ROOTED “ CORPORATE CULTURE in SMRT that are BAD, BUT , Dr Khaw held SMRT CEO being responsible for not changing SMRT Corporate Culture into “ POSITIVE CORPORATE CULTURE “ . . .

This is the Same PROBLEM on the so called “ DEEP-ROOTED CULTURE “ . . .

This is what POWER POLITICS & PLAYING of POWER are all about in SAF & certain key government agencies, in which , is like a type of “ DEEP-ROOTED CULTURE “ that is Said & Blames by SMRT CEO, Mr Desmond Kuek ! ! !
( This is just like what are being seen in the “ GAME OF THRONE “ ( Chinese is called :==>> 权术游戏 ) TV Dramas that are popular in the TV Channel, HBO ) ]

Our “ MOST EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ has LOTS of MONEY to BUY fanciful , very EXPENSIVE WEAPON from FOREIGN NATIONS ( Like Leopard A2 Main Battle Tanks that are shown often in National Day Parades , F-15G Fighters that was reported to cost over $4 Billions for Singapore to buy from USA & etc. . . . ) . . . . . , But , not enough money or, can’t even spare any efforts to protect our sons from being senselessly killed by Bad Commanders, Irresponsible Leaders & Evil-hearted Comrades . . . . . , so who can take it ? ? ?

Is it really that very , very , very Difficult for our “ MOST EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ to Protect our sons from being killed by Bad Commanders, Irresponsible Leaders & Evil-hearted Comrades that ABUSE of POWER & BREACH of PUBLIC TRUSTS ? ? ?

Such seemly Small Tasks seem to be very difficult to do by our “ MOST EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ , then how can Singaporean people & the whole world trusts our “ MOST EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ on much Bigger Tasks at all ! ! !

[ * * * NOTE : ==>> : Jack Ma , the founder of Alibaba website & now one of the biggest online platform in the world , says this words before that this type of person cannot be help because such person CANNOT be TRUSTED at all, in Chinese language :==>>

做不了小事，却向干大事的人 ( This means person that is unable to do Small Task , but want to do Big Task )

See website on this words of Jack Ma :

What do you all THINK so ? ? ? ]

Really set a very BAD EXAMPLE to Singaporean people & the whole world , if that is the case . . .

Really need more “ FIREMAN “ type of Ministers, like Dr Khaw Boon Wah & even Mr Shanmugan, to CLEAN UP , make full HOUSE CLEANING ( Chinese mean : 清理门户 ) & RESTRUCTURE all the MESS that have happened in our“ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ & even Private Sector , BUT need still quite reliable Non-PAP political leaders, like Mr Mr Low Thia Khiang & now, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, & NEUTRAL Singapore Judiciary System to MONITOR & CONTROL the action & behaviour of Top Civil Servants, to press such cases to happen . . .

It is useless effort if grc pap members just parrot questions to show their concern. Aftaid of the whips and their high pay. Its just for show. Hopeless and useless.

"No need to ask really, i think most Singaporean already knows the reasons."
"Since after TCB start form a Party prepare for coming GE.
Our PAP start trying to divert and using their cunning tactic trying to wash brain from the public by using Economic, stability, terrorism etc to threaten public again and again.
Singaporeans, if they PAP are so smart knowing terrorism coming affect the asian , they should able to nail them, why they PAP cannot do anything.
If they talking about getting more investor to invest into our Singapore, Why many investor pulling out of Singapore as well good jobs giving to Foreigners. I believe Singaporeans know by now PAP trying to make our Singaporeans like their slaves for work till you die.
Recently A friend of mine like PAP a lot start KPKB that his two son get retrench and still not able to get a job.
All my friends start to criticism him. and tell him that even your son get a job but will still report to foreigner......... He angry till do not know how to answer."
"Time for BOTH
Lhl + Ng Hen Eng
to STEP DOWN IMMEDIATELY !!!

One is a fanatic on NEPOTISM
and the other OVER GOLF !!!

Both must QUIT asap !!!"
Hen JUS RESIGN thats the right thing to do.Govt should replace U with a Real Soldier...An Ageing Doctor should step a side.
SAF is a true disgrace to the nation... Why are there so many death cases during peaceful time !!?? I strongly believe the so-called safety measures are full of flaws.
"Push here and push there,in the end some small small fly will take the responsibility and the top top Paper General and the Minister still will get MILLION of dollar salary and Big Big Bonus in the end of the year.This soldier die for the country during training,but no minister or General dare to attend,but a billionaire son pass away,many many high rank Minister rush to attend,even its Chinese New Year Eve,what is going wrong with our PAP Gov?"
"Why do Singaporeans need to sacrifice time and life To serve 2 years nsf and 10 years reservist duties and PR are not required.? After serving the 12 years service with peanuts salary, Singaporeans still have to buy high resale flats and car prices at the same prices as the PR. Why?
And the jobs are open equally between Singaporeans and PR, why?"
"Singapore do not need Terrorism, We already facing ""PAPorism""
Our Singaporeans already live like a slave for PAP.
Its Time to vote PAP out of coming GE2019 Parliament.
Time to change for your Young and new ""G"""

This whole talk is obviously wayang. Lets see who are the people that will form up the IGO.
Senior experienced staff need to highly appreciated and recognised too.
"they will say what they want to say and nothing YOU can say about it. -- so, just live with it, or ................"
"WP Pritam Singh was right in saying that SAF's promise of zero training incidents is not attainable, and only invite additional public pressure on the SAF.
No country can achieve zero military training incidents.
From news media, only Singapore and the US military have training incidents. Never hear of accidents from the rest of the world's army."
"If no one resigns and still drawing $millions, what is the point of COI COI COI?"
"Another wayang show. All questions need to be pre-submitted so that these million dollar useless ministers can get their army of staffs to prepare the answer. What is the point of asking in parliament? May as well setup an online forum and still serve the same purpose. If these ministers got what they claimed they are (talent), they should come out and answer open questions by the public and of course the should not be secret order to police and judge to prosecute anyone that ask unfavorable questions."
"U all guys and gals dun feel tired meh. Complain here complain there. If there is immunity, pls dun bother to fight or argue.

It's like hitting an egg to the rock. Sure KO. Stubbornness will lead u nowhere and u will lose in the end."
"China got fake products.
Our Singapore got FAKE President.
LOL, Who is greater ?"
"The problem with these ppl who are injured during training is bcos they take things too lightly, they are not conscious and alert of their own surroundings and they always assumed and take for granted that their commanders and superiors will take care of their safety when it is very clear cut that SAFETY IS EVERY INDIVIDUALS’ RESPONSIBILITY! Enough have been said, enough has been done. It is up to the individuals now. Dun cry baby when you were told to take proper cover but you choose to hide behind lalang!"
"Before u guys and gals talk about mindef and the def minister. First start by talking about the immunity protection. This immunity really kills whatever arguments, complaints and grievances."
"Serving the SAF is a good thing for all male Sin citizens, but do we really need all this exercises for Reservist/NSF who are we preparing to go to war with. If ever we go to war i think these day technology will do the job, but what is the cost of our soldiers while they die on duty $$$ Millions if not why are we killing our citizens. Even the HDB these days cost Millions !!!"
"Just sit back and start counting the nos. of peoples sitting in that building talking and talking and talking and nothing hav improve or change . Just count the total Salary that spent in that building for all the talking and , Peoples still die during training , Data can kanna hack , Peoples still losing job , really is time for all Singaporeans to wake up ."
I think those PAP ministers children must be ashame of their father or mother actions!!!
"Protect those with ranks on chest, not up the shoulders."
"Why no one dare to QUESTION SAF why Medical Doctors are GIVEN CAPTAIN RANK without going through vigorous training?!
Why nobody dare to QUESTION MINDEF, how many MEDICAL DOCTORS are misusing their RANK in MINDEF?!!
During real war, I believes lots will KILL MEDICAL DOCTORS due to their UNPROFESSIONAL ETHICS.!!"
We will be reminded of the no-blame culture..no high ranking people will be blamed
"Talk come talk to
Talk talk no you.
You guys thinks changes
Will come?
I doubt so.
My opion."
"Why there is no media live interview of the other 2 survivors.?
Singaporean’s just wants to know the truth whether it is saf or Pang fault?"
Will be so much different if the person died is son of a billionaire ....

These Experts forgot about Tanins. which is a compound that inhibit the bioabsorbability of Iron which is an important micro nutrients for our general health maintenance.so in a nutshell these experts are working for the teas merchants and businessman... .Come on.. Everything you consume contains a certain amount of toxins which is how nature works it is your liver that is our most hardworking organs that neutralise them so take care of your liver do not over work your precious hardworking liver... Everything in moderation.. Also an idle liver will be redundant as they forgot how to neutralise these toxins which they suppose to. .So our liver is a learning organs with organic AI..
The problem can be that these Experts may not have drank any tea before. Just cut and paste from anywhere like layman? Example: no mention of who should/should not drink which tea ? The tea type dosage calculation? The time and frequency to drink? The methods of preparation for each tea? The occasions to drink each tea?
I'm a tea drinker and drink for years. Motcha has the highest antioxidants among all tea. Drink moderately. Drink tea for good health.
"Tea can trigger migraine as it contain caffeine. On the other hand, caffeine help relief migraine, too.

Depending on individual, if you frequently had tea and had migraine. Quit drinking tea might solve the problem."
"Drink already can get palpitations. But, the Taiwanese Health program advised to continue drinking, just ignore the palpitations?

Is that true?"
Some Experts say coffee is good and some say tea is good. So moderatimoderation is the best. To each his own. Life is short. Live it up!
"Experts are just giving their own opinion but not necessarily right or true. In the past, experts said egg yolk is bad for health and should be avoided. Now many experts said egg yolk is good for health. Butter was said to be bad for health and people should switch to margarine. Later margarine was found to be high in trans fat and more detrimental to health than any other fats. There are many foods that are said by experts to be bad for health including fish(contain mercury and other heavy metals), meat due to chemicals and lots of antibiotics and high in cholesterol. So be a vegetarian."
"Be cautious with studies that show people who ""eat/drink _____ have lower risk of _____"". These studies are unscientific and are often sponsored by special interest groups to promote their products."
"It is inconsiderate to see Kopitiam Tauchew to pour a little sugar into the tea or coffee, that they believe will make it the tasty. Unknowingly, this make cause harm to diabetic patients who order Kopi O Kosong or Teh O Kosong as they would consume the sugary Kopi O or Teh O."
"Tea is good, more tea isn't better.
One in the morning, one in the afternoon, and that's it for the day.
Its the person who don't drink water but drinks 8 to ten cups of tea/coffee per day that's being poisoned."
Beer is the way to go. Best!!!
Its a pity TEA reduces my Hb.....I am a regular blood donor. Drinking tea for me cuts the absorption of my food nutrients by 87%...hence my low haemoglobin level drops and i will be rejected from donating.
Sometime later some “experts” somewhere will claim that even water is harmful lah and alcoholic drinks have benefits blah blah blah...
"To all people, if you do niot want to die of old age, then eat nothing, just drink tea daily, and you will go to 'HEAVEN or ''Hell' soonest."
Why drinking tea now becomes news???
"I don't drink coffee, i take tea my dear,
I like my toast done on one side,
You can hear it in my accent when I talk,
I'm an englishman in new york...
Whoa-ho, I'm an alien,
I'm a legal alien,
I'm an englishman in new york..."
Drink or eat in moderation then all's good 🙏
"Let us not fool ourselves! And let us also not let those experts fool us!! In fully tea consuming communities, people still die from cancer, stroke, heart attacks, diabetes and other common diseases!!! Please provide some convincing data and facts if what I said is incorrect!!!!"
"Some years ago say good, then say no good, and now say good again! Suka u pusing lah..."
"Notice everytime there is a major error they get fined so its left pocket to the right pocket. To make up the loss, they just increase price. WHY THOSE AT THE TOP DONT GET SACKED???"
"Improve services after being fined? In other words, pretending to offer more ""premium"" services and charge consumers higher prices to recoup their loss from the fine. Wake up your idea!!"
"Looks like the ""Lapses"" disease is contagious and spreading to all sectors in public services."
Left pocket to right pocket if you know what I mean...
"to improve your service: have your own team. this is called ownership, not outsourcing.... NOT everything needs to be outsourced.
E.g. a football match.... have you seen a team outsourced to another nation to play on its BEHALF?
won the match also has no glory. lost the match justvblane that outsourced Nation player "" Kayu""...
think about it
cheers

just like"
"Yes right! Unlike SMRT - easier to cover up lapses here, especially in a ""no blame"" culture."
"Isn't SG 'First World'? Then behave as First World starting with employment terms and conditions. If remunerations for public office holders can be astronomically out of this world and top honchos are paid market rates, why not the ordinary staffers that does the dirty work? Where is the equity? Isn't it gross to claim 'First World' status when truth isn't far from Third World?"
Make sure no more quickly knock door and double quickly run away for “attempting” to deliver parcels
"SingPost should come clean with a new name.

Reorg and rename to ""iDeliver"".
The new name brings focus to its CORE business of ""delivery"" of anything under the sun and the moon/stars.

Delivery of mail, chicken, burger, cadever, home furnishing (home moving), construction raw material, industrial equipment, machinery, passengers (air transport airline, sea transport cruise liner,, land transoort public bus mrt train escorted rental bike).

iDeliver."
"SingPost is another "" monopoly "" money making government related companies and follow stubborn government failure police . simply money first over service standard ! what can you do - the one and ONLY .
* over paid top management and below paid local average staffs .
* many of FT ( included fake paper FT ) and FW and most of them are low productivity also "" no care "" ... look at most of foreign post man behavior and counter staff attitude ....
Sing Post is the only listed company WITH OUT customer service"" hot line "" that listen and solve you problems by phone .. complaint / feedback only via email .. up to them to read or reply or investigation .....
i doubt they can improve IF bad culture failure policy remain ."
Hmm. ...Singpost should rename to Singthrow. Our sole postal service will never be effective and productive again unless the government gain full control and rejuvenate and reorganised it completely.
"$100k fine to be paid by how huh? my singpost company, or singpost big chief?
if service still bad, then better implement canning of top level people."
"Does it matter if the fine is 100k or 100millions ?

Virtually SingPost is government affiliated,
so is like taking money out of left pocket and stuff it into the right pocket.

Perhaps some sort of annual citizens feedback on the service on SingPost is what is needed,

Together with the improved measures addressing the constructive feedbac
publish them in mass media"
Such a biased headline. How can we be sure that they will definitely improve their standards? Maybe the standards will be go down further. And the Pappies will lie even more....
"Of the 46 years that I live in this country, only now, this kind of shxt start to appear!!"
"Improve your service standards? Yeah sure, if you can, PIGS can FLY!
Btw, with $100k as fine, it goes to show who is the REAL 'mastermind' running this show and why things cannot change for the better!
You go figure this out, especially those 69.9%! lolololol"
"Like the pap said, u must be paid enough to get the quality. These postman weren’t paid enough that is y quality not up to expectations."
"What!!! NOW 2019 then fine SingPost for what happened in 2017!! For a moment, I thought IMDA was so quick to look into the recent letters found burnt in dustbin. No we cannot trust our mail deliveries anymore.

Looks like SingPost is not the only one SLEEPING."
"SingPost 3-wheelers were notorious, they just parked anyhow anywhere on driveway of HDB carparks as if their grandfathers'. Their 3-wheelers could also be seen cutting in and out of lanes on major roads. Sometimes, forces on the ground behaved reflects mishandling at the top management as well. SingPost, SingTel needed reflections."
"Low paid postman, what u expect with many denands"
"So.. it took some negative news reports and a fine before Singpost thought of improving its services !!
Hence there is one specific question to ask its management. How many complaints did it receive from the public, these past few years and what did it do to address the issues raised in the complaints ?"
"Well, Singpost saves on the costs to give added dividends to shareholders---- Temasek holding, Alibaba and etc."
Paying high salary yet not getting good performance in return. High time to change the policy in the Ministers pay check. Make mistakes yet no punishment but blame others for the fault. Is this what we call 1st world country with KPI so Low.
PAP lapses how ?
It seems that privatization do not solve the problem of efficiency instead make it worst. Because money come first for the investors especially those 2 giants of Singapore investment...
Obviously the people running it are not good business people. Failing serving the customers well is like digging its own grave. The only reason it's still around is because it's a regulated monopoly. Only intetestin in meeting short term financial figures is the mistake of many failed businesses. Reminding me of SMRT.
Hire less FT will solve the problem
9 incidents? My cases alone already more than 9 incidents!
"Yes, improve service... they increase the postage soon."
"if only they can purely focus on mails delivery...u go to singpost, they provide so many services, staff there machaim cheap labour, collect passport/western union/selling bird's nest also have....and usually only few staff working...i really pity them"
Fine of 100k? Show us the monies!
"Singpost, SAF, SCDF, SMRT, Singhealth, SGH, SBS, SPH.. anymore start with 'S'?"
"Stop pushing the ground staffs too hard. It's very tough to run from estates to estates, blocks to blocks in hot weather. For starter, the CEO should ask all his top management staffs to do house to house delivery based tight timeline"
another lapse in government service?!
"Later they'll increase prices, so govt get the $100k fine but in the end public pay."
"This is why service standards are obviously compromised ...

https://www.singpost.com/about-us/news-releases/singpost-reports-first-quarter-net-profit-s187-million"
"Unfortunately, the delivery methods are outdated, slow, labour intensive, prone to mistakes, easy for sabotage and so on. For missed delivery, usually you need to make a trip to Post office to receive it too. Our mailboxes seriously should be multipurpose like POP stations. It caters for better security and better accountability too. For junk mails, it either should be banned or charged at a higher fees to the sender."
why do we have a monoploy... is it because we cannot stand up to competition... why should there be no other postal services with the same rights as SingPost... are we losing our competitive edge that we dare not to create competition...
Only...must be joking kidding laughing
You called that a fine? $100k is like 50 cents to Singpost.
"Why SMRT/LTA got no similar QoS criteria to ensure commuter satisfaction levels, but every time can still increase fares, hor? Want to wayang, then right pocket wayang, left pocket must also wayang, mah."
what is 100k to them? only nuts
Imda makes monies letter lost public suffer
"At the end of the day, they all sit down in a round table, and eat, drink , be merry.
But after dinner, payment is never by their own money."
WHERE IS MY MAILS??!!!......lol.
Only bustards stay at top posts.
All these years jobs were deprieve from Singaporean in the name of profits and flase “productivity”. Wake up 70%!
"That's 2017 fine! 2018 SingPost performed even worse! Just look at all the complains in their official social media page! Thousands of them! Seems like cheques, crucial gov letters, and other important documents can't be trusted with SingPost for now. The public lose it's confidence. I don't know what the ceo has been doing!"
"fine for what? they pay the fine, the treasury gets richer and life goes on as it is in singpost. always right pocket to left pocket and a quiet smile"
"9 incidents in 2017? what about 2018...now already 2019, IMDA sleeping?
Wow, seems like the root cause of ALL these problems does not start with Singpost but truly goes back to WHO is running the country@ lololol"
"This time, fine S$100,000.

Next time fine, morerer severe - S$101,000."
I thought they changed the letterboxes to locking system preventing junk mails from flooding out boxes? But my mailbox is still flooded with junk mails.
"SingPost, do better next time.
Get fined more!"
100k is just a slap on the wrist. Fine the top exec 50% of their pays you will see service improved immediately
"LOL NOW where are those pappies? Who loves to cut cost and control people. When trouble comes all hide and become quiet, not sure what they should do.
Bear this in mind you people, this is just the tip of the iceberg.

And the people who suffers are the lowly employees."
Singpost should hire more china people....Fire all those worthless singaporens
Singpost is now irrelevant...too focus on other business that it forget its core!
Singpost needs to hire more postmen. I hear JB got a lot of cheap labour.
"Did they cut the managements' bonuses and salaries?
If NO, it means the hard working staff and the shareholders are the suckers."
"soo scary ... SMRT lousy lousy, singpost also lousy lousy .... which other service providers also lousy lousy and waiting to be exposed ?!?!?!?"
They deserved it causing my letters to go missing.
Singpost is national disgrace.
The folly of hiring workers that are lowly paid. You don't have such a problem in the past. S'poreans prove to be more reliable and trustworthy. Walk up SingPost! Pay peanuts and you will get monkey business. Shame on your top management for this state of affairs. Sack the whole lot.
Could anyone give a breakdown of that 20m that were spent ? How mu h in terms of dollars and cents has SIN benefitted from it ?
"Malaysia Health-care system has overtaken Singapore as world's best health care in the world, specifically focusing on ""Expat retirees"" .They were at the rock bottom previously, they are catching up very fast.....We have highest salary in the world,in terms of quality,do we have such standard ??

Even the Opposition is questioning the govt,what is reason singapore had falled behind,previously they were ranked in the high position in the similar survey"
anywhere but not singapore will do.....
I think the public wants to know why Vietnam will spend $2M but Singapore spent $20M. We want know why we always try to inflate and rip off tax payers.... Maybe $4-5M but not $20M. Do you all agree?
Why did the Youth Olympic Games cost S'pore S$300 million or 3 times its original budget? Why does it cost 8 times more to host the Trump - Kim Summit in S'pore vs Vietnam? Are S'porean taxpayers being taken for a ride?
I don't care.
"Singspore volunteer to hold the summit.
It is not that they choose Singapore."
"More meeting by Trump and Kim will achieved nothing substantial unless both sides genuinely desire to end their 60+ years old Korean war.
Trump and Kim are just using each other to gain political publicity paid by Vietnam.
In turn Vietnam gain world wide exposure that can benefit the country now opening up to international investments rapidly.
You pat my back I pat yours."
kokkee has a point. a breakdown of the 20 million dollars spent hosting trump and kim is necessary for singaporean to know and understand.
"The last time, the Americans thought SG was in Malaysia. Now, they would think Vietnam is in China, hor."
"Meetings can take place safely anywhere, but the world must be peaceful"
I think pap pays kim and trump each $9m for wanting to come to singapore so pap can use it as a kpi for next election
Why must the venue be in Asia? Why no European countries volunteered?
Countries who host this two persons talk are a waste of tax payers money.
"good, a waste of tax payers money."
"Any country can hold a summit, not necessarily be Singapore, Singapore."
"Singapore, once again you overspend or overcalculated?"
"the leegime is digging up choa chu kang cemetery soon, to cater for 10 millions artificial population."
myob
Waste of money how many time they want to see each other. Waste of money and manpower.
"Feel Heng ah!

LOL"
Because Kim and Trump stay in Expensive 5 stars hotel. Food in hotel also expensive 5 stars price. Cars also 5 stars price.
Hahaha so now Singapore same level as Vietnam ahhh... good well done beat your chest so hard now look like a tool
Good wake-up call for many Singaporeans who still assume their country is well run and leading in SE Asia.
Nothing to gain. Publicly burn 20m just to have 2 jokers on holiday spree.
Both countries leaders should step down. There would be no more free lunch.
It is best that it is being held in Vietnam this time. The Summit is a waste of time for trump. North Korea does not need to listen to U.S. as it is powerful now. The times have changed.
"I'm just glad that it's being held somewhere this time round. We were completely ripped off by Trump, Fat Boy Kim and our government with the $20 mio tab. They had better show us a detailed breakdown of the expenses incurred."
"I supposed another ""Feel"" about..

I'm glad it's being held elsewhere - because Singaporeans still pays ALL the costs of the hosting, NOT P@P which clawed all benefits to their Credit.

I DON'T wish it was being held in Singapore again - read the first Clause.

I DON'T care because we Ordinary Singaporeans DON'T have any stake in this EXCEPT THE Ruling and THE Elites.

Did our Transport Fees decrease after this?
Did our SAF made SAFER after this?
Did our Medical Costs and Personal Well being Better after this?

A Big FAT NO."
"what is the added value to SG and benefit to Singaporeans after $ 16.3 million public fund gone ?
perhaps forever no answer or case closed after ministry statement .
Is there any performance difference between world highest paid politicians and one of world lower paid politicians ? "" SG can Vietnam also can lah "" . Note Vietnam already become manufacturer center as they also forward to automation in this day .. after Vietnam catch up everything and lead by their low paid leaders . we are winner or loser ? are we really succeed ?"
"With China as a big brother behind ,north Korea don't dare to use their nuclear"
The summit is a waste of resources. It is only for the 2 corrupt and crooked warmongers to gain fame.
PAP comes to its senses. keep your noses out. and if u got nothing to do for those million dollar salary ...just shut up.
Dont waste money on 3 clowns. 2 fat clowns . And 1 clown prince
Great! Fat Kim should smear some VX on Fat Trump's face. In Vietnam.
The man is an embarrassment and a menace.
The govt dont bother and dont answer to singaporeans. Their style of answering is one liner or got head no tail or go head no tail and no body or answer you back with a question. Cut the crab! Vote them out. All rubbish answering.
Nobody gives a damn
Why Should we foot his bill. We had nothing gain. The last time our stupid Govt. waste 13 Millions of Citizen's hard earn money.
HOPE BOTH ENDED IN FIERY HELL!
i hope both get assassinated by nerve gas. solve a lot of problems.

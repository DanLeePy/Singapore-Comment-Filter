Hi allI'm off to Singapore for the first time in a long time next week. I've booked a couple of fine dining restaurants and just wondering what the dress code is for fine dining in Singapore?,0,0,0,0,0
Smart Casual should be fine. So a pair of jeans + covered shoe and a shirt would suffice,0,0,0,0,0
Could you give the names of the restaurants?It varies widely.,0,0,0,0,0

Odette is really nice though. I think jacket is ok for dinner while button down shirt or even polo is ok for lunch.,0,0,0,0,0
"Odette has no dress code, Les Amis requires smart casual. But in general, if you're gonna feel bothered if you're underdressed, then throw on what you think is appropriate. I'd defo go in a jacket sans tie for both",0,0,0,0,0
